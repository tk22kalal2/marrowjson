      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of giant cell arteritis. Giant cell temporal arteritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder of large to small-sized arteries that especially affects the temporal arteries. It is seen in people over 50 years of age. It usually presents with facial pain or headache along the course of the superficial temporal artery. It can also affect: • Ophthalmic arteries - leading to sudden onset diplopia or blindness • Aorta - leading to giant-cell aortitis • Vertebral arteries. A biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Giant cell arteritis needs to be promptly diagnosed and treated with steroids to prevent permanent blindness.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Inflammatory lesions are focally distributed",

        "D": "Fragmentation is seen in the internal elastic lamina"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A negative biopsy cannot exclude the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis. It is because the lesions are focally distributed. A biopsy sample may be taken from the normal part of the artery leading to a false-negative report. An adequate biopsy requires at least a 1-cm segment. Biopsy findings: • Giant cell arteritis is primarily medial granulomatous inflammation. • These lesions involve the internal elastic lamina leading to elastic lamina fragmentation. • There is intimal thickening that reduces the luminal diameter. Granulomas with multinucleated giant cells, infiltrate of T cells (CD4+ > CD8+), and macrophages. Note: According to the 21st edition of Harrison's Medicine, as involvement of the vessel may be segmental, getting a biopsy segment of 3-5 cm together with serial sectioning of biopsy specimens would help to increase a positive yield. And Robbin's 10th edition mentions that an adequate biopsy requires at least a 1-cm segment.",

On examination, the blood pressure recorded on the left upper limb was found to be lower than that of the right upper limb. Her aortic arch angiogram showed narrowing of the arch of the aorta and subclavian artery. What is the likely diagnosis?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and radiological findings are suggestive of Takayasu arteritis. Takayasu's arteritis is a granulomatous vasculitis affecting medium and large-sized arteries, in this case, the aortic arch and its branches. Clinical manifestations include vision disturbances and profound weakening of the pulses, especially in the upper extremities. Histopathology: • Irregular thickening of the vessel wall is seen with associated intimal hyperplasia. • Characteristic granulomatous inflammation, with the presence of giant cells and patchy medial necrosis. • Disease progression is associated with collagenous scarring and chronic inflammatory infiltrates across all layers of the vessel wall. Other options - Option A: Giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis, is an inflammation of medium and large-sized vessels. It is more common in women and people aged >50 years. The clinical features include headache associated with scalp pain and jaw claudication, fever, fatigue, malaise, and weight loss. Half of the patients have temporal artery abnormalities such as enlargement, tenderness, nodular swelling, and loss of pulse of the temporal artery, either unilateral or bilateral. Gentle pressure on the scalp may elicit focal or generalized tenderness. Though the arch of the aorta may also be involved in giant cell arteritis (known as giant cell aortitis), it is seen in people more than 50 years of age. Whereas, Takayasu arteritis is seen more commonly in adolescents and young women. Option C: Thromboangiitis obliterans, also known as Buerger's disease, is an inflammatory occlusive vascular disorder involving medium- and small-sized vessels in the distal extremities. It is most frequently seen in male smokers less than 40 years of age. Option D: Behcet's disease is a neutrophilic vasculitis affecting small- to medium-sized vessels that classically presents as a clinical triad of recurrent oral aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, and uveitis. There can also be gastrointestinal and pulmonary manifestations, with disease mortality related to severe neurologic involvement or rupture of vascular aneurysms.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The most commonly involved blood vessel in Takayasu arteritis is the subclavian artery. Takayasu arteritis is an inflammatory and stenotic disease of medium and large-sized arteries characterized by a strong predilection for the aortic arch and its branches. It is also known as aortic arch syndrome. The order of arteries affected in Takayasu arteritis is subclavian artery > common carotid artery > abdominal aorta > renal artery > aortic arch = vertebral > coeliac axis > iliac > pulmonary > coronary artery. Takayasu arteritis causes irregular thickening of the vessel wall with intimal hyperplasia leading to narrowing of the lumen and organ ischemia. It may have various clinical presentations depending on the vessel involved: Arch of aorta and its branches: Subclavian artery - leads to weak pulses in the upper extremities. Hence, it is also known as pulseless disease. Carotid arteries - lead to weak pulses, blindness, neurological deficits. Distal aorta - leads to claudication of the legs. Pulmonary artery - leads to pulmonary hypertension. Coronary arteries - lead to myocardial infarction. Renal arteries - lead to systemic hypertension.",

It typically affects young adults. The patient may present with rapidly accelerating hypertension due to renal artery involvement (most common) or abdominal pain and bloody stools caused by involvement of gastrointestinal vessels. Option A: Hyperplastic arteriosclerosis is a vascular pathology seen in severe hypertension. Option B: Cystic medial degeneration leads to dissecting aortic aneurysm. Option C: Mönckeberg's arteriosclerosis does not cause infarction.",

This is the major antibody responsible for Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA). Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are a heterogeneous group of autoantibodies directed against the constituents of neutrophils or monocytes. Many patients with vasculitis have circulating antibodies that react with neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens. The two most important ANCAs related to vasculitis are: \n   • Anti-proteinase-3/PR3-ANCA/c-ANCA - Directed against PR3, which is a neutrophil azurophilic granule constituent.\n   • Anti-myeloperoxidase/MPO-ANCA/p-ANCA - Directed against MPO, which is a lysosomal granule constituent involved in oxygen free-radical generation. MPO-ANCAs are induced by several therapeutic agents, particularly propylthiouracil.",

The patients present with intermittent claudication, chronic ulcerations of the extremity, and later progress to frank gangrene. The microscopy findings include luminal thrombosis (thromboangiitis), that is, thrombus containing microabscesses that occlude the lumen (obliterans). They contain small microabscesses composed of neutrophils. Berger disease refers to IgA nephropathy. It is seen within 3-5 days of a sore throat. It is associated with a purpuric rash in the lower limbs.",

Option A: Adventitial mononuclear infiltrates with perivascular cuffing of the vasa vasorum has been described in Takayasu arteritis. Option B: Fragmented neutrophils undergoing apoptosis infiltrating blood vessels termed leukocytoclastic vasculitis are seen in small vessel vasculitis. Option D: Fibrinoid necrosis is seen in immune reactions involving blood vessels seen in immunologically mediated vasculitis syndromes.",
