      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of multiple myeloma. Plasma cell dyscrasias are B-cell proliferations that contain neoplastic plasma cells that secrete a monoclonal Ig or Ig fragment. Multiple myeloma is a malignant neoplasm of plasma cells characterized by the presence of monoclonal immunoglobulin or light chains in the serum and urine. It is a disease of older adults, with a peak age of incidence of 65 to 70 years. Signs and symptoms include: hypercalcemia, pathologic fractures/lytic bone lesions, renal failure, and anemia. Investigations reveal: radiography - punched-out lytic lesions on X-ray; electrophoresis - monoclonal elevation of one immunoglobulin; urinalysis - free kappa and lambda light chains (Bence Jones proteins); bone marrow biopsy - 10 to 20% plasma cells (normal is < 5%); peripheral smear - rouleaux formation. A high level of M proteins in myeloma causes red cells in the peripheral blood smears to stick to one another in linear arrays, a finding referred to as rouleaux formation. Plasma cell tumors are positive for CD138.",

Cytogenetic abnormalities in multiple myeloma include: Translocations involving IGH on chromosome 14q - most frequent. Monosomy or partial deletion of chromosome 13 (13q14) - found by FISH (nearly half the cases). Translocation of the IgH occurs frequently with cyclin D1 on chromosome 11q and cyclin D3 on chromosome 6p. Deletions of chromosome 17p involving TP53 tumor-suppressor locus. Translocations with cyclin D1 are associated with a good outcome, whereas deletion of 17p and t(4;14) portend an aggressive course.",

It is produced by the tumor cells themselves and by resident marrow stromal cells. IL-6, along with other cytokines, promotes osteoclastic activity and lytic bone lesions. High serum levels of IL-6 are seen in patients with active disease and are associated with a poor prognosis.",

The immunosecretory disorders are a diverse group of diseases associated with the proliferation of an abnormal clone of immunoglobulin-synthesizing, terminally differentiated B cells. These disorders include: • Multiple myeloma (MM) and its variants • Plasmacytoma • Waldenström macroglobulinemia • Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance • Monoclonal Ig deposition diseases - includes primary amyloidosis and non-amyloidotic types.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "MIP-1α secreted by myeloma cells is responsible for the marked increase in bone resorption and hypercalcemia. Factors produced by neoplastic plasma cells mediate bone destruction, the major pathologic feature of multiple myeloma. Of particular importance, myeloma-derived macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP-1α) upregulates the expression of the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) by bone marrow stromal cells, which in turn activates osteoclasts. Other factors released from tumor cells, such as modulators of the Wnt pathway, are potent inhibitors of osteoblast function. The net effect is a marked increase in bone resorption, which leads to hypercalcemia and pathological fractures. Serum alkaline phosphatase levels are normal in multiple myeloma.",

Features of myeloma kidney: • Bence-Jones proteinuria and cast nephropathy - The main cause of renal dysfunction is related to Bence-Jones (light-chain) proteinuria. Ig light chains are directly toxic to epithelial cells. Bence-Jones proteins form large, histologically distinct tubular casts that obstruct the tubular lumens and induce a characteristic inflammatory reaction (light-chain cast nephropathy). • Amyloidosis of AL type, formed from free light chains (usually of λ type) • Light-chain deposition disease - light chains (usually of κ type) deposit in the glomerular basement membrane and mesangium causing a glomerulopathy and in tubular basement membranes, which may cause tubulointerstitial nephritis. • Hypercalcemia - Nephrocalcinosis",

This is known as Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. 'M' or monoclonal spike is seen in this condition. Here, it is caused by IgM; in multiple myeloma, it is caused by IgG. It is characterized by the absence of lytic lesions and normal serum calcium levels. IgM greatly increases the viscosity of the blood, giving rise to a hyperviscosity syndrome characterized by the following: visual impairment, neurologic problems, and bleeding. Cryoglobulinemia is also associated with hyperviscosity. The normal relative viscosity of the serum is 1.8. Hyperviscosity is seen in: multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, cryoglobulinemia, and myeloproliferative disorders.",
