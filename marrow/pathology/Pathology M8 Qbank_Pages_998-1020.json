      "explanation": "The endoscopy findings of the watermelon stomach are suggestive of gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE). In GAVE, endoscopy reveals longitudinal stripes of edematous, erythematous mucosa that alternate with less severely injured, paler mucosa, giving the appearance of a watermelon. GAVE is responsible for 4% of non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding. A Dieulafoy lesion is a non-stress-related cause of GI bleeding. It is due to a submucosal artery that does not branch properly within the wall of the stomach.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Familial gastric cancer (diffuse type) is strongly associated with germline loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene CDH1. It encodes the cell adhesion protein, E-cadherin. Half of the sporadic diffuse gastric cancer cases occur due to loss-of-function mutations in CDH1. In the remaining cases, E-cadherin expression is decreased, due to hypermethylation and silencing of the CDH1 promoter. Thus, the loss of E-cadherin is a key step in the development of diffuse gastric cancer. Sporadic intestinal-type gastric cancers are strongly associated with increased signaling via the Wnt pathway (loss-of-function mutation of APC/gain-of-function mutation of β-catenin). Mutation of TP53 is also found in the majority of sporadic gastric cancers of both types.",

      "explanation": "The diffuse-type gastric adenocarcinoma does not form bulky tumors. It grows in a diffuse-infiltrating pattern that stiffens the gastric wall (linitis plastica). In contrast, the intestinal type tends to form bulky masses. Loss of E-cadherin is the key step in the development of diffuse gastric cancer, resulting in discohesive cells. These single cells have large, intracytoplasmic mucin vacuoles that push the nucleus to the periphery, creating a signet-ring cell morphology. Mutation of TP53 is found in a majority of sporadic gastric cancers of both diffuse and intestinal types.

The most common site is the appendix, followed by the ileum and rectum. Ileal carcinoid with metastasis to the liver causes carcinoid syndrome because the vasoactive substances escape the filtering actions of the liver. This is characterized by cutaneous flushing, sweating, bronchospasm, colicky abdominal pain, diarrhea, and right-sided cardiac valvular fibrosis. The behavior of the carcinoid tumors differs according to their location: Foregut carcinoid tumors include the stomach, duodenum, proximal to the ligament of Treitz, and esophagus. Gastric carcinoid tumors originate from gastric enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. They are well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors with variable behavior. They rarely metastasize and are generally cured by resection. Gastric carcinoid tumors without predisposing factors are often more aggressive. Midgut carcinoid tumors arise in the jejunum and ileum, are often multiple, and tend to be aggressive. Hindgut carcinoid tumors arise in the appendix and colorectum. Appendiceal tumors are usually less than 2 cm in diameter and are almost always benign. Metastasis of rectal carcinoid tumors is uncommon. Gastric carcinoid tumors may be associated with endocrine cell hyperplasia, autoimmune chronic atrophic gastritis, MEN-I, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.",

The most important prognostic factors include the degree of histological differentiation, mitotic rate, and Ki-67 proliferative index. The diagnosis of carcinoid tumor is made by increased levels of 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) in a 24-hour urine sample. It is positive in larger tumors or if metastases are present. Note: The most important prognostic factor for esophageal carcinoma and stomach carcinoma is the depth of invasion.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). It arises from the interstitial cells of Cajal, or pacemaker cells, of the gastrointestinal muscularis propria. It is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the abdomen. The peak age of incidence is 60 years. In sporadic GIST, the most common mutations seen are gain-of-function mutation in KIT (75-80%) and PDGFRA mutation (8%). Inherited/germline GIST is seen in Carney-Stratakis syndrome. It is due to loss-of-function mutation of SDH, which has an increased risk for GIST and paraganglioma. GIST at a younger age is associated with the following: Carney triad, which includes gastric GIST, paraganglioma, and pulmonary chondroma, and neurofibromatosis type 1. Grossly, it usually forms a solitary, well-circumscribed, fleshy mass covered by ulcerated or intact mucosa. Histologically, the tumor is composed of spindle cells (most common), epithelioid cells, or mixed cell types. The below image shows microscopy of GIST composed of bundles, or fascicles, of spindle-shaped tumor cells. GIST - Histopathology: Spindle cells, Epithelioid cells. Complete surgical resection is the primary treatment for localized gastric GIST. Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat CML, can be used to treat GIST with mutations in KIT or PDGFRA.",

However, 5-10% ofGIST lack KIT expression. DOG-1 is expressed in all GIST, including CD117-negative cases. Hence,DOG-1 marker is most specific for GIST.",

      "explanation": "1019The eosinophilic appearing cells marked as A are the parietal cells, the absence of which is notassociated with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome. The cells marked as B are Chief cells.Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome is caused by gastrin-secreting neuroendocrine tumors, which leads toparital cell hyperplasia. Gastrinomas are almost always found in the small intestine or pancreas.The most remarkable feature found in the stomach is an increase in oxyntic mucosal thicknessdue to massive parietal cell hyperplasia.Stomach - HistopathologyParietal cellsChief cellsOther options:Option A and C: Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presenceof autoantibodies that impairs the production or activity of the intrinsic factor (IF) that is releasedfrom the parietal cells, which is required for the uptake of vitamin B12. There are three types ofautoantibodies namely, type I, II, and III. The action of each of these include:•Autoantibody type I prevents the binding of vitamin B12 to the intrinsic factor (IF).•Autoantibody type II prevents the binding of vitamin B12-IF complex to the ileal receptors.• Autoantibody type III acts against the α and ° subunits of the gastric proton pump, whichimpairs the production of intrinsic factor.These patients also develop chronic atrophic gastritis, characterized by loss of parietal cells,infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells, and megaloblastic changes in mucosal cells.Option B: Gastric carcinoid tumors originate from gastric enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. Theyare referred to as well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors. The peak incidence of carcinoidtumors is in the 6th decade. These tumors occur throughout the GI tract, most commonly in theappendix, ileum, and rectum, in decreasing order of frequency.Gastric carcinoid tumors may be associated with endocrine cell hyperplasia, autoimmune chronicatrophic gastritis, MEN-I, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Ileal carcinoid may cause carcinoidsyndrome which is characterized by cutaneous flushing, sweating, bronchospasm, colickyabdominal pain, diarrhea, and right-sided cardiac valvular fibrosis.1020",
