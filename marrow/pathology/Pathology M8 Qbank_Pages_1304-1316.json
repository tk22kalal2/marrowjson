      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario and the images showing amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are diagnostic of Alzheimer's disease (AD), complicated by cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). The formation and aggregation of Aβ peptides are responsible for AD. Alzheimer's Disease: Amyloid plaques, Neurofibrillary tangles. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is neurotrophic and neuroprotective. It is present in astrocytes and neuroglia. This protein is cleaved at 3 sites by secretase enzymes (α, β, and γ), and the products are known as Aβ peptides. In Alzheimer's disease, Aβ peptides get aggregated in the form of amyloid plaques, which stain positive for Congo red. These get deposited within the neural tissue (Aβ 42) and the cerebral arterioles (Aβ 40 protein, causing CAA), which causes neuronal dysfunction, and is the first sign of AD. Normally, tau proteins within the neurons stabilize microtubules; however, in AD, these get hyperphosphorylated and lose their function. Hyperphosphorylated tau proteins combine with cytoplasmic fibrils, to form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and get abnormally accumulated around the neuronal nucleus.",

      "explanation": "This clinical scenario is suggestive of Parkinson's disease. This condition is not associated with Pick cells and Pick bodies. They are seen in Pick's disease or frontotemporal dementia. In Parkinson's disease, there is loss of the substantia nigra neurons projecting to the striatum. This leads to pallor of the substantia nigra as well as a decrease or absence of dopamine in the striatum. This leads to slowing of movements and tremors. Lewy bodies are seen within the neurons of affected patients. They are filamentous projections of the protein alpha-synuclein or ubiquitin. They are present in surviving neurons and can be found in the cortex.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The MRI shows bilateral atrophy of caudate nuclei with compensatory dilatation of lateral ventricles, also known as boxcar ventricles. Along with the clinical features, it is suggestive of Huntington's disease (HD). It has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. It is commonly seen in the 4th and 5th decades of life. It is a degenerative disease of the caudate and putamen (striate neurons) caused by trinucleotide (CAG) repeats in the huntingtin gene on chromosome 4. The severity of the disease depends on the number of repeats. With more repeats, the disease becomes more severe. The disease also manifests at an earlier age, a phenomenon called anticipation. The caudate nucleus is dramatically atrophied, with accompanying atrophy of the putamen, cortex, and hydrocephalus ex vacuo of the 3rd ventricle. The medium-sized GABAergic neurons are especially affected. It causes chorea and dementia. Motor problems like chorea typically precede dementia.",

This finding is seen in the Schwann cells of dorsal root ganglia, peripheral nerves, endothelial cells, and pituicytes. These cells are called amphicytes. Ataxia-telangiectasia is due to mutations of the ATM gene, located on chromosome 11q. It predominantly affects the cerebellum with the loss of Purkinje and granule cells. There is also degeneration of the dorsal columns, spinocerebellar tract, anterior horn cells, and peripheral neuropathy. Telangiectatic lesions are found in the CNS as well as in the conjunctiva and skin of the face, neck, and arms. The lymph nodes, thymus, and gonads are hypoplastic.",
