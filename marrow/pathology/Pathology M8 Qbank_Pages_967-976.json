This condition results due to the rupture ofRokitansky-Aschoff sinuses.Xanthogranulomatous CholecystitisXanthoma cells972Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses are bile-filled outpouchings of the gallbladder mucosa through thegallbladder wall. They develop in reaction to chronic inflammation of the gallbladder. Eventually,they may rupture into the wall of the gallbladder. This results in the accumulation of macrophagesthat have ingested biliary phospholipids, which are called xanthoma cells.Rokitansky-Aschoff sinusLumenFlattened mucosaOutpouchingBileChronic cholecystitis may have other sequelae:••Porcelain gallbladder - dystrophic calcification of the gallbladder wallHyalinizing cholecystitis - replacement of the gallbladder wall by dense fibrosis, with or withoutcalcification (leads to higher incidence of gallbladder carcinoma)• Hydrops of the gallbladder - atrophic, obstructed, dilated gallbladder containing clear fluidAcute cholecystitis includes the following variants:• Emphysematous cholecystitis - acute infection of the gallbladder by gas-forming organisms• Acalculous cholecystitis due to gallbladder stasis and ischemia",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Pancreas divisum is the most common congenital anomaly of the pancreas.The pancreas develops by fusion of the larger dorsal and smaller ventral pancreatic buds. Thedorsal duct is the dominant duct during development and it drains into the minor papilla. Theventral duct drains into the major papilla. After fusion, the following ducts are formed:• Main pancreatic duct (of Wirsung) - formed by fusion of ducts of dorsal and ventral buds, drainsinto the major papilla•Accessory pancreatic duct (of Santorini) - formed by the proximal portion of the dorsal duct,drains into the minor papillaIn pancreas divisum, the ventral and dorsal ducts fail to fuse. Hence, the majority of the pancreascontinues to drain through the dominant dorsal duct that enters the duodenum at the minor973papilla while the ventral duct, along with the bile duct, drains into the major papilla. Thesepatients are more prone to pancreatitis.Pancreas divisumNormal pancreasPancreas divisumOMARROWMinor papillaCommon bileductAccessoryduct ofSantoriniMain pancreaticduct (Wirsung)Major papillaCommon bileduotDorsal duct ofSantoriniVentral duct ofWirsungThe other congenital anomalies of the pancreas are:• Annular pancreas - band-like ring of normal pancreatic tissue encircling 2nd part of duodenum,may cause obstruction•Ectopic pancreas common in stomach, duodenum, and jejunum (found in about 2% ofpostmortem exams)•Agenesis rarely seen, associated with mutations of PDX1 (homeobox gene)-",

      "explanation": "This clinical scenario in a young patient with positive family history of similar episodes issuggestive of hereditary pancreatitis. Acute episodes of pancreatitis can be precipitatedby hypercalcemia, not hypocalcemia.The following genes are implicated in hereditary pancreatitis:•Gain-of-function mutation in trypsinogen gene (PRSS1) - most common⚫ Loss-of-function mutation in trypsin inhibitor gene (SPINK1)••⚫ Loss of CFTR - abnormal secretions that promote protein plugging, duct obstruction, leading topancreatitisHereditary pancreatitis is associated with a 40% lifetime risk of developing pancreatic cancer.",

The most frequently associated mutation with this condition is K-RAS.It is attributed to the production of platelet-aggregating factors and procoagulants from the tumoror its necrotic products. Both venous and arterial thrombi can occur. Venous thrombi canembolize to the lungs.Molecular alterations involved in pancreatic carcinogenesis are:Following genes are associated with an inherited predisposition to pancreatic cancer:• BRCA2 mutation - pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and ovarian cancers• PRSS1 mutation - pancreatic carcinoma secondary to hereditary pancreatitisGeneTypeChromosomeKRAS(most common oncogene)Oncogene (activated by pointmutation)12pCDKN2A(most common tumor-suppressor gene)Tumor suppressor gene9pTP53SMAD4Tumor suppressor geneTumor suppressor gene17p18q",

      "explanation": "Mucinous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas have dense stroma, similar to the ovarian stroma.These tumors have large cystic cavities filled with thick, tenacious mucin. They are lined bycolumnar, mucin-producing epithelium with dense stroma. This results in similarity to ovarianstroma.They usually arise in the tail of the pancreas and can be precursors to invasive carcinomas. Theyare associated with mutations in the KRAS oncogene, and the tumor-suppressor genes TP53 andRNF43.",
