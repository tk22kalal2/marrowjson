        "D": "Reactive arthritis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The x-ray image of the hip shows narrowing of the joint space and subchondral sclerosis, which is diagnostic of osteoarthritis (OA), also called degenerative joint disease. OA is the most common type of joint disease, which is characterized by the degeneration of joint cartilage. This results in structural and functional failure of synovial joints. Osteoarthritis can be classified into 2 types: Primary OA: insidious onset, without apparent initiating cause, as an aging phenomenon; Secondary OA: predisposing conditions such as joint deformity, a previous joint injury, or an underlying systemic disease such as diabetes, ochronosis, hemochromatosis, or marked obesity. The knees and hands are more commonly affected in women, and the hips in men. OA lesions occur due to the degeneration of the articular cartilage and its disordered repair. Inflammatory cells are sparse, but cytokines and diffusible factors, particularly TGF-β (which induces matrix metalloproteinases), TNF, prostaglandins, and nitric oxide, have been implicated in OA.",

      "question": "A 28-year-old woman presents with complaints of joint pain and progressive loss of joint motion. On examination, symmetric joint swelling of the hands is seen. A subcutaneous nodule is seen over her right forearm. Microscopy of the excised nodule shows the findings given in the image below. Which of the following lab findings will be seen in this patient?",

        "D": "Calcium pyrophosphate crystals in joint aspirate"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis. The patient's serum will test positive for rheumatoid factor. Microscopy of the excised nodule shows a necrotizing granuloma with a central zone of fibrinoid necrosis surrounded by a prominent rim of activated macrophages and numerous lymphocytes and plasma cells. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of autoimmune origin that principally attacks the joints, producing nonsuppurative, proliferative, and inflammatory synovitis. The inflammation progresses to the destruction of the articular cartilage and ankylosis of the joints. In RA, the synovium contains germinal centers with secondary follicles and abundant plasma cells, which produce antibodies, some of which are autoantibodies. Many of the autoantibodies produced in the lymphoid organs are specific for citrullinated peptides (CCPs). 80% of patients have serum IgM or IgA autoantibodies that bind to the Fc portions of their own IgG. These autoantibodies are called rheumatoid factor and may also deposit in joints as immune complexes. The characteristic histologic features of RA include: synovial cell hyperplasia and proliferation, dense inflammatory infiltrates, increased vascularity due to angiogenesis, fibrinopurulent exudate on the synovial and joint surfaces, osteoclastic activity in underlying bone, and subcutaneous nodule: necrotizing granulomas with a central zone of fibrinoid necrosis surrounded by activated macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. This altogether leads to a mass of edematous synovium called pannus, which grows over the articular cartilage and causes its erosion.",

      "question": "An obese 35-year-old man with renal failure presents with excruciating joint pain in the right knee. It is associated with localized hyperemia. Joint aspiration is done, which shows dense neutrophilic infiltrate and the following finding under polarized light. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Rheumatoid arthritis",

        "C": "Ankylosing spondylitis",
        "D": "Septic arthritis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis is gout. Aspirate from the joint shows dense neutrophilic infiltrate and crystals that are long, slender, needle-shaped, and negatively birefringent. Gout is marked by transient attacks of acute arthritis initiated by crystallization of monosodium urate (MSU) within and around joints. This results in the production of cytokines that recruit leukocytes. Macrophages phagocytose the MSU, and the inflammasome activates caspase-1, which is involved in the production of some biologically active cytokines. The distinctive morphologic changes in gout are acute arthritis, chronic tophaceous arthritis, tophi in various sites, and gouty nephropathy. Tophi are the pathognomonic hallmark of gout. These are large aggregations of urate crystals surrounded by an intense inflammatory reaction of foreign body giant cells, which may appear in the articular cartilage, ligaments, tendons, bursae, earlobes, fingertips, or kidneys. Gouty nephropathy refers to the renal complications caused by MSU crystals or tophi in the renal medullary interstitium or tubules. Complications include uric acid nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition disease (CPPD), also known as pseudo-gout and chondrocalcinosis. The image shows aspirated crystals which are rhomboid, 0.5 to 5 μm in the greatest dimension, and positively birefringent (yellow). It usually occurs in individuals older than 50 years of age and becomes more common with old age. CPPD is classified into sporadic (idiopathic), hereditary, and secondary types. It is caused by germline mutations in the pyrophosphate transport channel. The secondary form is associated with previous joint damage, hyperparathyroidism, hemochromatosis, hypomagnesemia, hypothyroidism, ochronosis, and diabetes. Inflammation is usually milder than in gout. CPPD may produce acute, subacute, or chronic arthritis that can be confused with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. The joint involvement may be monoarticular or polyarticular; the knees, followed by the wrists, elbows, shoulders, and ankles, are most commonly affected.",

Liposarcoma is one of the most common sarcomas of adulthood, seen mainly in people in their 50s to 60s, in the deep soft tissues of the proximal extremities and in the retroperitoneum. Amplification of 12q13-q15 and t(12;16) are characteristic of well-differentiated and myxoid liposarcomas, respectively. One of the key genes in the amplified region of chromosome 12q is MDM2, which is a potent inhibitor of p53. Well-differentiated liposarcoma contains adipocytes with scattered atypical spindle cells. Myxoid liposarcoma contains an abundant basophilic extracellular matrix, arborizing capillaries ('chicken-wire' or 'crow's feet' vasculature), and primitive cells reminiscent of fetal fat. The well-differentiated variant is relatively indolent, while the myxoid/round cell type is intermediate in its malignant behavior.",

Liposarcoma is the most common sarcoma in adults and is usually seen in the 5th to 6th decade of life. They commonly occur in the deep soft tissues of the proximal extremities and in the retroperitoneum. Histologically, the liposarcomas are divided into three subtypes: \n   • Well-differentiated liposarcoma: It consists of mature adipocytes and scattered spindle cells with hyperchromatic nuclei. It is associated with amplification of 12q13-q15.\n   • Myxoid liposarcoma: It contains abundant basophilic extracellular matrix with branching capillaries. Few immature adipocytes are found scattered within the matrix. It is associated with t(12;16).\n   • Pleomorphic liposarcoma: It consists of sheets of anaplastic cells with bizarre nuclei and few immature adipocytes. Among the three subtypes, the pleomorphic liposarcoma is the most malignant and often metastasizes, while the well-differentiated is least malignant. Myxoid liposarcoma has intermediate malignancy behavior.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of nodular fasciitis. Nodular fasciitis is a self-limited fibroblastic and myofibroblastic proliferation that typically occurs in young adults in the upper extremity. Etiology is unclear, but a history of trauma is present in approximately 25% of cases. The tumors grow rapidly over a period of several weeks, typically no larger than 3 cm. It typically regresses spontaneously, and if excised, rarely recurs. Microscopically, it is richly cellular and contains plump, immature-appearing fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, arranged randomly or in short fascicles reminiscent of tissue culture fibroblasts. A gradient of maturation from cellular, loose, and myxoid to organized and fibrous is typical. The cells vary in size and shape (spindle to stellate) and have conspicuous nucleoli; mitotic figures are abundant. Immunohistochemistry shows positivity for vimentin, smooth muscle actin, and muscle-specific actin. Desmoid tumors are firm and poorly demarcated masses that infiltrate the surrounding muscle, nerve, and fat. Histologically, fibroblasts are arranged in long parallel fascicles amid dense collagen.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of sarcoma botryoides, which is a variant of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. It is a malignant mesenchymal tumor with skeletal muscle differentiation. Rhabdomyosarcomas are the common soft tissue sarcomas of childhood and adolescence, classified into four subtypes: alveolar, embryonal, pleomorphic, and spindle-shaped/sclerosing. Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma contains sheets of both primitive round and spindled cells in a myxoid stroma. Sarcoma botryoides is a variant that occurs in the walls of hollow, mucosal-lined structures, such as the nasopharynx, common bile duct, bladder, and vagina. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma consists of a network of fibrous septae that divide the cells into clusters or aggregates, creating a crude resemblance to pulmonary alveoli. Pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma consists of large, sometimes multinucleated, bizarre eosinophilic tumor cells. Spindle cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma consists of fusiform cells with vesicular chromatin arranged in long fascicles or in a storiform pattern. On immunohistochemistry, they are positive for desmin, myoglobin, myogenin, MyoD1, and vimentin. Pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma is seen predominantly in adults. The botryoid variant of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma has the best prognosis, while the pleomorphic subtype is often fatal.",

Most synovial sarcomas show a characteristic chromosomal translocation t(X;18)(p11;q11) producing SS18-SSX1, SS18-SSX2, or SS18-SSX4 fusion genes. They are morphologically classified into monophasic or biphasic: • Monophasic synovial sarcoma consists of uniform spindle cells with scant cytoplasm and dense chromatin growing in short, tightly packed fascicles. • Biphasic type consists of a spindle cell component with gland-like structures composed of cuboidal to columnar epithelioid cells. Tumor cells, especially in the biphasic type, are positive for epithelial markers (e.g., keratins), differentiating them from most of the other sarcomas.",
