      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The structures marked A are fat cells and B are hematopoietic elements. The normal ratio of fat cells to hematopoietic elements in a normal adult is 1:1. Normal bone marrow consists of fat cells and hematopoietic elements. In hypoplastic states (like aplastic anemia), the proportion of fat cells is greatly increased (increased fat-to-cell ratio). Conversely, fat cells often disappear in conditions like hematopoietic tumors and in diseases with compensatory hyperplasias (like hemolytic anemias) and neoplastic proliferations such as leukemias (decreased fat-to-cell ratio).",

      "explanation": "In the case of lymph node metastases, there is prominent reticular hyperplasia. Reticular hyperplasia or sinus histiocytosis refers to an increase in the number and size of the cells that line lymphatic sinusoids. Although nonspecific, this form of hyperplasia may be particularly prominent in lymph nodes draining cancers such as carcinoma of the breast. The lining lymphatic endothelial cells are markedly hypertrophied and macrophages are greatly increased in numbers, resulting in the expansion and distension of the sinuses.
