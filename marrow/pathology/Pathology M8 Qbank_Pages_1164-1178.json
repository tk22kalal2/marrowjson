      "explanation": "The clinical scenario and the image showing hyperpigmentation of palmar creases and oralmucosa are suggestive of primary adrenal insufficiency. It presents with low aldosterone, highrenin, and high ACTH levels.In primary adrenal insufficiency, lack of aldosterone production results in compensatory rise inACTH and renin levels. The high ACTH results in hyperpigmentation. The most common causesare autoimmune in developed countries and tuberculosis in developing countries.In secondary adrenal insufficiency, there is pituitary dysfunction leading to low ACTH levels.Renin and aldosterone levels are normal, as they function independently of ACTH.",

It can occur due to adrenal hyperplasia, adenoma, or carcinoma. It presentswith the following features:•Hypertension (most common)• Hypokalemia• Metabolic alkalosisPolyuria (due to ANP)• Polydipsia (due to polyuria)• Muscle weaknessIt is confirmed by elevated ratios of plasma aldosterone concentration to plasma renin activity(PAC / PRA).When primary hyperaldosteronism is due to an aldosterone-secreting adenoma, it is called Connsyndrome. Patients are usually treated with spironolactone followed by surgical removal ofadenoma. In patients treated with spironolactone, the adenomas contain eosinophilic cytoplasmicinclusions called spironolactone bodies.1173Spironolactone bodiesSpironolactone bodiesEosinophiliccytoplasmicinclusionsIn secondary hyperaldosteronism, aldosterone release occurs in response to the activation of therenin-angiotensin system (RAAS).",

It is alsocalled APECED (autoimmune polyendocrinopathy, candidiasis, and ectodermal dystrophy).It is caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene. This gene usually increasestolerance of central T-cells to peripheral tissue antigens. When this function is lost, the T-cellsbecome more prone to mount immune reactions against tissue antigens, promotingautoimmunity. These patients develop autoantibodies against IL-17 and IL-22, which are crucialfor defense against fungal infections.•It presents in childhood with the following features:Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis• Ectodermal dystrophy (abnormalities of the skin, dental enamel, and nails)• Organ-specific autoimmune disorders such as -• Autoimmune adrenalitis• Autoimmune hypoparathyroidism•Idiopathic hypogonadism• Pernicious anemiaAutoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (APS) type 2 usually presents in early adulthood as acombination of the following:• Adrenal insufficiency• Autoimmune thyroiditis or type 1 diabetes.",
