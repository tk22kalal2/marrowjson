      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Renal cell carcinoma is CK7 negative and CK20 negative.The most common subtype of renal cell carcinoma is clear-cell renal cell carcinoma, which is CK7negative. Therefore, in determining the origin of cancer of unknown primary,immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression of renal cell carcinoma will generally be CK7 negativeand CK20 negative. Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and papillary renal cell carcinoma arepositive for CK7.843",
