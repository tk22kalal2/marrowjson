      "explanation": "A non-sense mutation is seen in ° o thalassemia.A point mutation is a change in which a single base is substituted with a different base. The pointmutations within the coding sequences of the DNA are of two types:153• Missense mutations: These involve alteration of a single base in a triplet of bases. It leads to thereplacement of one amino acid by another in the gene product. These mutations alter the meaningof the sequence of the encoded protein. Based on the substituted amino acid coded, the missensemutations are again of two types:• Conservative missense mutation: The substituted amino acid is biochemically similar to theoriginal. It typically causes little change in the function of the protein.• Non-conservative missense mutation: This type of mutation replaces the normal amino acid witha biochemically different one.• Nonsense mutations: It is a point mutation in a sequence of DNA that results in a prematurestop codon.For example, a point mutation affecting the codon for glutamine (CAG) creates a stop codon(UAG) if U is substituted for C. This change leads to premature termination of °-globin genetranslation, and the short peptide that is produced is rapidly degraded. The resulting deficiency of°-globin chains can give rise to a severe form of anemia called ᵒo thalassemia.Option B: α-thalassemias are caused by inherited deletions that result in the reduced or absentsynthesis of α-globin chains.Option C: Sickle-cell anemia is an example of non-conservative missense mutation. It occurs dueto the replacement of the 6th glutamic acid by valine in the beta-globin gene on chromosome 11.Option D: Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is an inherited disorder caused by intrinsic defects in thered cell membrane skeleton that render red cells spheroid less deformable and vulnerable tosplenic sequestration and destruction.",

      "explanation": "ABO blood group and HLA are both examples of codominant inheritance.In a codominant phenotype, alleles of a gene pair in a heterozygote are fully expressed. Therebyresulting in an offspring with a phenotype that is neither dominant nor recessive and both thealleles of a gene pair contributes to the phenotype.Mendelian traits are usually described as dominant or recessive:• A dominant allele produces a dominant phenotype in individuals who have one copy of theallele, which can come from just one parent.•A recessive allele produces a recessive phenotype, in individuals who have two copies of theallele, one from each parent.The illustration below shows the codominant inheritance pattern of the blood group.154Blood type ABlood type BA alleleCodominanceB alleleO allele-RecessiveAOBOAOABBOneBlood type A Blood type AB Blood type B Blood type OHair colour, height, and skin color are polygenic traits.",

This leads to splenic fibrosis, organinfarcts, and bone changes. The numerous differing end-organ derangements are all related to theprimary defect in hemoglobin synthesis.Option B: In variable expressivity, a trait is seen in all individuals carrying the mutant gene but isexpressed differently among them.Option C: Polymorphisms are caused by interactions between multiple variant forms of genes andenvironmental factors.Option D: Genetic heterogeneity refers to mutations at several genetic loci that may produce thesame trait.
