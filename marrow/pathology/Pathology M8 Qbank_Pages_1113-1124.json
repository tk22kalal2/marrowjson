Thus a simple panel of TTF-1 and p40may be able to classify most non-small cell carcinoma-not otherwise specified cases.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of adenocarcinoma of the lung. It is the most common form of lung cancer. It is an invasive malignant epithelial tumor with glandular differentiation. The tumor cells produce mucin. It is usually located peripherally (it arises from the terminal bronchiole). Molecular genetics show frequent mutations in EGFR, ALK, ROS, MET, and RET (receptor tyrosine kinase genes) or KRAS mutations. Histologically, lepidic growth patterns are seen. It refers to the pattern of spread of the tumor in which the tumor cells 'crawl' along normal-appearing alveolar septae and resembles butterflies resting on a fence. Adenocarcinomas grow in various patterns, including acinar, lepidic, papillary, micropapillary, and solid with mucin formation. Tumor cells are positive for mucin and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1). Tumors 3 cm or less in diameter characterized by lepidic growth pattern without stromal invasion are now called adenocarcinoma in situ (formerly called bronchoalveolar carcinoma).",

The lifetime risk of developing mesothelioma in heavily exposedindividuals is as high as 7% to 10%.It has strong male predilection (3:1).

Bronchial neuroendocrine tumors(NETs) arise from Kulchitsky cells.WHO divides neuroendocrine neoplasms into four categories:• Typical carcinoid•Atypical carcinoid•Large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma• Small-cell carcinoma.Carcinoid tumors are low-grade malignant epithelial neoplasms that represent 1% to 5% of alllung tumors. It is not related to smoking. Carcinoids may occur in patients with multipleendocrine neoplasia type 1.On gross examination, these tumors grow as fingerlike or spherical polypoid masses that projectinto the lumen of the bronchus or as collar button lesions, penetrating the bronchial wall to fanout in the peribronchial tissue.Histologically, the tumor is composed of organoid, trabecular, palisading, ribbon, or rosette-likearrangements of cells separated by a delicate fibrovascular stroma. On electron microscopy, thecells exhibit the dense-core neurosecretory granules.Immunohistochemistry shows positivity for serotonin, neuron-specific enolase, bombesin,calcitonin, or other peptides.10% of the cases may produce carcinoid syndrome.Most carcinoids follow a relatively benign course and have good prognosis.",

      "explanation": "Approximately, 10% of bronchial carcinoids give rise to the carcinoid syndrome.Most bronchial carcinoids follow a relatively benign course, do not have secretory activity and donot metastasize to distant sites.Classic carcinoid syndrome is characterized by intermittent attacks of diarrhea, flushing,bronchospasm and cyanosis.Carcinoid syndrome is due to excessive production of serotonin, a specialised product oftryptophan metabolism by argentaffin cells (cells in the carcinoid tumor). It is then metabolisedand excreted in urine.If urinary levels of 5-HIAA exceed 25 mg/day, a diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome can be made.",
