It isthe most common congenital abnormality of the genitourinary tract. The testes can arrestanywhere during descent, and the most common site is the inguinal region.•Phases of testicular descent:Transabdominal phase: Testes come to lie in the lower abdomen or pelvis. This phase of descentis regulated by Mullerian-inhibiting substances.•• Inguinoscrotal phase: Testes descend along the inguinal canal and reach the scrotal sac. Thisphase of the descent is regulated by androgen-induced calcitonin gene-related peptide from the890genitofemoral nerve.The exact pathogenesis remains unknown, however, deficiency in gonadotropins andMullerian-inhibiting substance (MIS) and increased expression of estradiol in the placenta arethought to play a role. It is associated with testicular atrophy and dysfunction, which result insterility. Cryptorchid testes carry a 3-5-fold higher risk for testicular cancer (usually seminoma).",

The Sertoli cells are supporting cells that areunder the action of FSH. Leydig cells, which are present in the interstitial spaces, are under theaction of luteinizing hormone(LH) and produce testosterone. Testosterone has a feedbackinhibition on LH.In Sertoli cell-only syndrome, within the seminiferous tubules, only Sertoli cells are seen and nogerm cells. Hence, there are no spermatozoa and there is no feedback inhibition, which results inincreased FSH levels. So, testosterone levels, and LH levels remain unaffected since Leydig cellsare not affected.

In advanced stages, the testis ismarkedly enlarged and consists entirely of soft, necrotic, hemorrhagic tissue.893CM5Adult torsion is typically seen in adolescence and presents with the sudden onset of testicularpain. Neonatal torsion can occur either in utero or shortly after birth and the cause is unknown.It results from a bilateral anatomic defect that leads to increased mobility of the testes (bell-clapper abnormality). Twisting of the spermatic cord typically cuts off the venous drainage of thetestis. But, thick-walled arteries remain patent, producing intense vascular engorgement, followedby hemorrhagic infarction. If the testis is manually untwisted within approximately 6 hours of theonset of torsion, there is a good chance that the testis will remain viable.",

It is one of the key methods used in confirmation ofthe diagnosis, prognostication, and staging of prostate cancer (adenocarcinoma).The Gleason grading system is primarily based on analyzing the architecture of the tumor cells inthe biopsy specimens obtained. The architecture, i.e., the Gleason Patterns are classified as:•Pattern 3: Well-formed glands⚫ Pattern 4: Poorly formed/Fused/Cribriform glands/Glomeruloid glands•• Pattern 5: Sheets of the tumor, individual cells, cords, and solid nests of cells, Comedo necrosis• Pattern 1 and 2 are no longer definedMost tumor specimens contain more than one pattern. Therefore, a numeric grade is assigned toboth the primary pattern and the next most frequent secondary pattern. The sum of thenumeric grades provides the Gleason score.• Scores 2-5 are no longer assigned.• Scores of 6 - 7 are potentially treatable cancers• Scores 8 - 10 are advanced cancers that are less likely to be cured.Based on the gleason score, they are classified into the following grade groups:• Grade group 1: score&lt;=6•Grade group 2: 3+4=7• Grade group 3: 4+3=7• Grade group 4: score 8•Grade group 5: scores 9-10",

      "explanation": "The upper-age-specific reference value of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in men of age70-79 is 6.5 ng/mL.PSA is a product of prostatic epithelium secreted in the semen. Measurement of serum PSA levelsis widely used to assist the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of prostate cancer. Older menhave a higher serum PSA level than younger men, so the normal range varies with age.907The serum PSA levels as a screening test for prostatic cancer has poor sensitivity and specificity.This is because various other factors such as trauma, infections, BPH, instrumentation/digitalexam of the prostate, and ejaculation can increase serum PSA levels. A value of ≥4 ng/mL usuallywarrants serial testing or further evaluation.In an effort to improve the sensitivity and specificity of serum PSA levels, many novel indices areused:.•Age-specific PSA reference rangesPSA velocity: Rate of change of PSA values with time. It is considered that PSA velocity of 0.75ng/mL per year measured at least 3 times over a period of 1.5 to 2 yrs is significant to diagnoseProstate cancer.• PSA density: Serum PSA/volume of the prostate gland•The ratio of free to bound serum PSAAgeUpper age-specific PSA(ng/mL)40-492.5yrs50-593.5yrs60-694.5yrs70-79yrs6.5",
