      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The above scenario is suggestive of Merkel cell carcinoma. It arises from Merkel cells. These cells are located in the epithelial basal cell layer and have neuroendocrine and mechanoreceptor functions. Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare and aggressive neuroendocrine tumor of the skin, most commonly found in white men and diagnosed at a mean age of 70 years. A rapidly growing, flesh-colored papule or plaque characterizes the disease. About 80% of the cases are seen associated with Merkel cell polyomavirus. Regional lymph nodes are involved in 30% of the patients and 50% will develop systemic disease. CK-20 is a specific marker for Merkel cell carcinoma. Wide local excision is usually necessary. The image below shows Merkel cell carcinoma composed of uniform small round cells having granular chromatin and scant cytoplasm.",

      "question": "A histopathological examination of melanocytic nevus in a patient showed nests of larger, round pigmented cells superficially. At the deeper extent of the lesion, it showed fascicles of non-pigmented cells resembling neural tissue. What does this signify?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Benign nature of nevus",
        "B": "Coexisting nerve tumor",
        "C": "Risk of malignant transformation into melanoma",
        "D": "Neural invasion of tumor cells"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Nevus cells often become non-pigmented and resemble neural tissue as they grow deep into the dermis. This change is called neurotization and suggests the benign nature of the nevus. This morphological change in nevus cells occurs due to progressive loss of tyrosinase activity and acquisition of cholinesterase activity in deeper 'nerve-like' nevus cells. Melanocytic nevi (moles) are common benign neoplasms caused by acquired activating mutations in components of the RAS signaling pathway. Based on the location, it may be junctional nevi, intradermal nevi, or compound nevi. Melanocytic nevi are thought to progress through a series of morphologic changes over time. Superficial nevus cells are larger, tend to produce melanin, and grow in nests. Deeper nevus cells are smaller, produce little or no pigment, and appear as cords and single cells. At the deepest extent of the lesions, these cells often acquire fusiform contours and grow in fascicles resembling neural tissue (neurotization). Melanocytic nevi with neurotization indicate normal maturation change and help in differentiating benign nevi from melanomas (which lack such features).",

      "explanation": "The above image is suggestive of melanoma. Mutations in the hedgehog signalling pathway are associated with basal cell carcinoma. All other mutations are associated with melanoma. Melanoma is a highly aggressive malignancy linked to UV exposure. Most sporadic melanomas are associated with mutations in cell cycle regulators (p16/INK4a, CDK4), proteins in receptor tyrosine kinase signalling pathway (KIT, RAS, BRAF), and telomerase (TERT mutation). Dysplastic nevus syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition with an inherited CDKN2A mutation that can lead to familial melanoma.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The superficial spreading type of melanoma is the most common type of melanoma. The progression of melanoma may be described as: • Radial growth phase: the horizontal spread of melanoma within the epidermis and superficial dermis. • Acral lentiginous - unrelated to sun exposure. • Lentigo maligna (Hutchinson freckle) - sun-exposed regions. • Superficial spreading (most common). • Vertical growth phase: the tumor cells invade downward into the deeper dermal layers as an expansile mass (nodular). The image below shows melanoma in the radial growth phase. It shows the irregular nested and single-cell growth of melanoma cells within the epidermis and an underlying inflammatory response within the dermis. The image below shows melanoma cells that have large nuclei with irregular contours. The chromatin is characteristically clumped at the periphery of the nuclear membrane with prominent red (eosinophilic) nucleoli.",

        "D": "Regression"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The above image is suggestive of melanoma. The absence of regression is a favorable prognostic factor in melanomas. Immunohistochemistry markers for melanoma are: S-100, HMB (Human Melanoma Black)-45, and LDH-MELAN-A. Regression is defined as partial or complete disappearance of a previously documented tumor in the absence of therapeutic interventions or physical trauma. Microscopically, it is characterized by the replacement of melanoma cells by dense inflammatory cell infiltrate or dermal fibrosis. This phenomenon explains some apparent discrepancies between expected and observed prognosis based on tumor thickness and also the cases of metastatic melanoma with occult primary. Determinants of a more favorable prognosis in melanoma include: thinner tumor depth, no or very few mitoses (< 1 per mm2), a brisk tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte response, the absence of regression, lack of ulceration, and absence of metastases in the sentinel lymph node.",

      "explanation": "The above image shows a jigsaw puzzle appearance, which is seen in cylindroma (turban tumor/Spiegler's tumor). Cylindroma is a familial autosomal dominant disorder. It is due to the loss of the cylindromatosis gene, CYLD, on chromosome 16q12-13. It has also been reported to follow radiotherapy epilation of the scalp. The lesions are frequently multiple, smooth, firm, pink to red, and somewhat pedunculated. They are mostly seen on the scalp. Histologically, it contains mosaic-like masses - a jigsaw appearance. Malignant transformation is very rare. Surgery is the treatment of choice. Note: Genetic syndromes associated with adnexal tumors include germline mutations in CYLD - familial cylindromatosis, familial trichoepithelioma; Brooke-Spiegler syndrome - associated with trichoepithelioma, cylindroma, spiradenoma; Muir-Torre syndrome - sebaceous adenomas; Cowden syndrome - multiple trichilemmomas.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Xanthoma",
        "B": "Fat necrosis",
        "C": "Dermatofibroma",
        "D": "Sarcoidosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The image above shows Touton giant cells having a central ring of nuclei while the peripheral cytoplasm is clear due to accumulated lipid. These cells are formed by the fusion of lipid-containing macrophages. They are not seen in sarcoidosis. These cells are seen in: • Fat necrosis • Xanthoma • Xanthogranulomas • Dermatofibroma. The cardinal histopathologic feature of sarcoidosis is the non-caseating epithelioid granuloma with occasional other microscopic features: • Schaumann bodies - laminated concretions composed of calcium and proteins • Asteroid bodies - stellate inclusions enclosed within giant cells.",

      "question": "A 35-year-old man presented with a single hypoesthetic and hypopigmented patch on the lateral aspect of the forearm. Microscopy of a biopsy sample from the lesion revealed granulomatous inflammation, but acid-fast bacilli were not identified. What is the likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Tuberculoid leprosy",
        "B": "Lepromatous leprosy",
        "C": "Histioid leprosy",
        "D": "Primary syphilis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis is tuberculoid leprosy. On microscopic examination, tuberculoid leprosy has granulomatous lesions closely resembling those found in tuberculosis. Because of the strong host defense, bacilli are almost never found, hence the name paucibacillary leprosy. Leprosy, or Hansen disease, is a slowly progressive infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae, mainly affecting the skin and peripheral nerves.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Max Joseph's space is a histopathological feature of lichen planus. Histological features of lichen planus: • Orthokeratosis, parakeratosis, thickening of the stratum granulosum. • Acanthosis with the formation of colloid bodies (also known as Civatte bodies/Sabouraud bodies) • Liquefactive degeneration of the stratum basale, with separation from the underlying lamina propria, as a result of desmosome loss, creating small spaces (Max Joseph spaces) • Infiltration of T cells in a band-like pattern into the dermis, 'hugging' the basal layer (interface dermatitis).",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The image shows silvery-white scaly lesions on the extensor aspect of the knees, suggestive of psoriasis. Munro microabscesses are seen in psoriasis. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis that appears to have an autoimmune basis. The lesions are pink to salmon-colored plaques covered by loosely adherent silver-white scales. Auspitz sign and Koebner phenomenon can be demonstrated. Nail changes include pitting, dimpling, separation of the nail plate, onycholysis, thickening, and crumbling. Microscopy shows thinning of the stratum granulosum, suprapapillary plates, and neutrophils forming small aggregates within the superficial epidermis (spongiform pustules) and within the stratum corneum (Munro microabscesses). Psoriasis: Epidermis shows psoriasiform hyperplasia with markedly elongated rete ridges, clubbing of rete ridges at the base, and thinning of suprapapillary epidermal plates. The dermis shows dilated blood vessels and edema. Some types of microabscesses and their examples are given below: Predominant cell - Name of microabscess - Disease: Neutrophilic microabscess - Papillary tip microabscess - Mu; Lymphocytic microabscess - Pautrier's microabscess - Mycosis fungoides; Eosinophilic microabscess - not specified - Pemphigus vegetans; Munro microabscess (superficial) - Spongiform pustules of Kogoj (deep) - Psoriasis; Dermatitis herpetiformis - not specified.",
