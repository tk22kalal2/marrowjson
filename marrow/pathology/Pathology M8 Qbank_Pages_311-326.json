      "explanation": "There is the deposition of AA proteins in reactive systemic amyloidosis (secondary amyloidosis).In inflammatory states, there is a release of IL-1 and IL-6, which act on the liver cells. The liverincreases the production of SAA (serum amyloid-associated) proteins which circulate bound tohigh-density lipoproteins. This gives rise to AA proteins, which get deposited in tissues causingreactive systemic amyloidosis or secondary amyloidosis.The most common sites are the kidney and heart.It is usually seen secondary to:• Rheumatoid arthritis (most common)•⚫ Tuberculosis• Bronchiectasis•Chronic osteomyelitis317• Inflammatory bowel disease•⚫ Ankylosing spondylitis•Malignancies - renal cell cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma",

      "explanation": "Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) is associated with the deposition of mutanttransthyretin protein (TTR).FAP is an autosomal dominant condition. The deposition occurs as amyloid fibrils in peripheraland autonomic nerves. Mutated TTR is prone to misfolding and aggregation, and shows resistanceto proteolysis.Systemic senile amyloidosis (amyloid of aging) refers to the systemic deposition of normalTTR amyloid in elderly patients. Symptomatic patients present with restrictive cardiomyopathyand arrhythmias. Another rare form affecting predominantly the heart results from the depositionof a mutant form of TTR.Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal-recessive condition seen in individuals ofMediterranean descent (Armenian, Sephardic Jewish, and Arabic). The affected gene encodes aprotein called pyrin, which is involved in cytokine production. The amyloid fibril proteins in thiscondition are made up of AA proteins.

Depending on the antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that are involvedin T-cell activation, there are 2 pathways:• Direct pathway of allorecognition - MHC antigens are presented by the APCs in the graft• Indirect pathway of allorecognition - MHC antigens are presented by the recipient's own APCs(e.g., macrophages)The early activation of NK cells kill allogeneic target cells directly or via antibody-dependentcellular cytotoxicity and release various chemokines and immunomodulatory cytokines.",
