      "explanation": "Achalasia cardia is characterized by decreased release of NO(nitric oxide) and VIP(vasoactiveintestinal polypeptide) in the distal part of esophagus.Normally, NO and VIP are secreted by the inhibitory neurons of the Auerbach's plexus in thedistal esophagus. This leads to relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). In achalasiacardia, these inhibitory neurons degenerate leading to decreased release of NO and VIP. Thiscauses increased LES tone.The triad of achalasia cardia is as follows:• Incomplete relaxation of LES• Increased tone of LES• Absent peristalsis (aperistalisis)",
