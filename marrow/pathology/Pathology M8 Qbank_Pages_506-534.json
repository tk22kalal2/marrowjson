      "explanation": "The clinical presentation and peripheral smear findings point toward a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The peripheral smear shows smudge cells and increased lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm, round to slightly irregular nuclei containing clumped chromatin. This large number of monotonous, uniform-looking, mature lymphocytes is often described as a 'convent-girl' appearance. Peripheral smear of chronic lymphocytic leukemia showing smudge cells. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) / Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) is the most common leukemia among adults in the Western world. The differentiating point between CLL and SLL is that in CLL the absolute lymphocyte count is >5000 per mm³ and in SLL: <5000 per mm³. It is usually asymptomatic at diagnosis but can present with easy fatigability, weight loss, and anorexia. Generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are usually seen. Total blood count: Total leukocyte count is highly variable; leukopenia is seen when the marrow is involved. Hypogammaglobulinemia is common and contributes to increased susceptibility to infections. 10% to 15% of patients develop hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia due to autoantibodies made by nonneoplastic B cells. Peripheral smear: Predominantly shows small lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm. Smudge cells or basket cells or parachute cells - artifacts of the lymphocytes which are disrupted during the process of making smears. Contains a large number of monotonous, uniform-looking, mature lymphocytes, which is often described as a 'convent-girl' appearance. Spherocytes (due to coexisting autoimmune hemolytic anemia) and nucleated RBCs (due to premature release of progenitors in face of severe anemia, marrow infiltration by the tumor, or both). Lymph node biopsy: Diffuse effacement composed of small lymphocytes admixed with variable numbers of larger activated lymphocytes that often gather in loose aggregates. Referred to as proliferation centers, which contain mitotically active cells. Proliferation centers are pathognomonic for CLL/SLL. The chromosomal defects: Deletion of 13q (commonest and has a good prognosis). Deletion of 11q. Trisomy 12q. Deletion of 17p (poor prognosis).",

      "explanation": "The translocation seen in marginal-zone lymphoma is t(11;18). Other translocations includet(14;18), t(1;14).Marginal-zone lymphoma begins as a polyclonal immune reaction. Signals from theantigen-stimulated T helper cells, drive the growth and survival of the clonal B-cells. At this stage,it is reversible, as in gastric MALToma after antibiotics against Helicobacter pylori.With time tumour cells may acquire mutations that render their growth and survivalantigen-independent. Translocations such as t(11;18), t(14;18), or t(1;14) up-regulate the expressionand function of BCL10 or MALT1 and promote the growth and survival of B cells.These translocations are relatively specific for extranodal marginal-zone lymphomas.",
