Arms of a chromosome: map arm (p) and q arm. In a banded karyotype, each arm of the chromosome is divided into two or more regions bordered by prominent bands. The regions are numbered (e.g., 1, 2, 3) from the centromere outward. Each region is further subdivided into bands and sub-bands, and these are ordered numerically as well.

However, children born to an affected father and a normalmother do not inherit the disease. Hence, only the daughters of the affected mother will transmitthe disease.This is because this condition is due to a mutation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which isderived from the maternal mitochondria. The ovum contains several mitochondria, while thespermatozoa have very few mitochondria if present. Hence, the mitochondrial DNA of thezygote is entirely derived from the ovum.LHON is a neurodegenerative disease that manifests as progressive bilateral loss of centralvision.

It occurs due to a gain-of-function (expansion) mutation in thehuntingtin gene on chromosome 4p.The disease shows genetic anticipation and has an early-onset (2-3 decades) if inherited from thefather.Cognitive impairment is an early feature. Pathologically, atrophy of caudate and putamen with exvacuo ventriculomegaly is seen. Decreased acetylcholine leads to dementia and decreased GABAand increased dopamine lead to chorea.Treatment consists of haloperidol and tetrabenazine.Trinucleotide repeat disorders:DiseaseRepeClinical featuresatsFragile X- syndromeCGGMental retardation, large ears, and jaws, macroorchidismin malesMyotonic Dystrophy(chromoCTGMuscle loss, cardiac arrhythsome 19)mia, cataracts, frontal baldingHuntington's diseaseCAGAffective disorderSpinocerebellar ataxia type 1CAGProgressive ataxia, dysarthria,dysmetria.Friedreich's ataxiaGAAProgressive ataxia, dysarthria,hypertrophiccardiomyopathy.",

The most commonof these is the PTPN11 which encodes a protein tyrosine phosphatase on chromosome 12.Clinical features include:• Short stature• Short webbed neck• Cystic hygroma• Tall forehead•• Low posterior hairline• Dental malocclusion197Although it shares many clinical features with Turner's syndrome, Noonan syndromeaffects both sexes. It follows an autosomal dominant pattern and it also has a different patternof congenital heart disease, typically involving right-sided lesions.",
