        "A": "Failure of migration of neural crest cells",

      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Hirschsprung disease occurs due to the failure of migration of the neural crest cells to the bowelwall.During normal embryogenesis, the neural crest cells migrate from the caecum to the rectum. Theenteric neuronal plexuses develop from these migrated neural crest cells.In Hirschsprung disease, there is an arrest in the migration of these cells, which leads to thedevelopment of a distal intestinal segment that is devoid of Meissner (submucosal) and theAuerbach (myenteric) plexus. Hence this segment is referred to as the aganglionic segment.As a result, there is a lack of coordination in the peristaltic contractions and functionalobstruction, which further leads to the dilation of the intestine proximal to the affected segment,leading to congenital megacolon. Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating the absence ofganglion cells in biopsy sections.1040Hirschsprung diseaseARAganglionicSegment(Contracted)OMARROWSome conditions may cause acquired megacolon. These include:•Chagas disease, due to the loss of ganglion cells• Visceral myopathy•Obstruction by neoplasm or inflammatory stricture• Toxic megacolon complicating ulcerative colitis• Functional psychosomatic disordersGanglionicSegment(Relaxed)",

      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of Hirschsprung disease. It is associated with Down's syndrome.Hirschsprung disease is also known as congenital aganglionic megacolon. 10% of all cases occur inchildren with Down's syndrome.The premature arrest of normal migration of neural crest cells from the cecum to the rectumproduces aganglionosis of the distal intestinal segment. This causes functional obstruction of theaffected bowel and proximal dilation. The absence of ganglion cells in the affected segment inbiopsy confirms the diagnosis.1041Hirschsprung diseaseARAganglionicSegment(Contracted)OMARROWGanglionicSegment(Relaxed)Gastrointestinal abnormalities associated with Down's syndrome include:• Duodenal atresia• Annular pancreas• Hirschsprung diseaseGastrointestinal abnormalities associated with Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) include:• Meckel's diverticulum• MalrotationGastrointestinal abnormalities associated with Patau syndrome (trisomy 13) include:⚫ Omphalocele• Incomplete rotation of the colon• Meckel's diverticulum",

      "explanation": "1044The given scenario is suggestive of Crohn's disease. It is strongly associated with mutations in thenucleotide oligomerization binding domain 2 (NOD2) gene.Crohn's disease occurs due to the host response against microbes. NOD2 encodes an intracellularprotein that binds to bacterial peptidoglycans and activates the NF-κB pathway. Antibodiesagainst the bacterial protein flagellin may be seen in NOD2-associated disease.Other Crohn's disease-related genes are autophagy-related 16-like (ATG16L1), andimmunity-related GTPase M (IRGM), which are critical for cellular responses to intracellularbacteria.Crohn's disease most commonly involves the terminal ileum but can affect all parts of the GIT.The following microscopic changes may be seen:•Aphthoid ulcerations• Focal crypt abscesses• Non-caseating granulomas can be found in all layers of the bowel, lymph nodes, mesentery,peritoneum, liver, and pancreasNote: Ulcerative colitis-associated genes are ECM1 and HNFA.",
