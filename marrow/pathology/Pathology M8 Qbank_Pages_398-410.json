      "explanation": "The most common trigger for hemolysis in G6PD deficiency is infection. Viral hepatitis, pneumonia, and typhoid are the common infections that trigger hemolysis. Episodic hemolysis (both intravascular and extravascular) is seen in G6PD deficiency. It is due to exposures that cause oxidative stress. The triggers include: Infections - oxygen-derived free radicals produced by activated leukocytes, Drugs - Antimalarials (primaquine and chloroquine), Sulfonamides, Nitrofurantoin, and Diet - fava beans.",

        "A": "These are seen in G6PD deficiency",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The given peripheral smear shows Heinz bodies which are dark stained inclusion bodies in redcells. They can cause intravascular as well as extravascular hemolysis.In G6PD-deficiency, the RBCs are exposed to high levels of oxidants. This causes cross-linking ofreactive sulfhydryl groups on globin chains. The globin chains become denatured and formmembrane-bound precipitates known as Heinz bodies. These can be detected by supravitalstaining.Heinz bodies can damage the membrane sufficiently to cause intravascular hemolysis.403As RBCs with Heinz bodies pass through the spleen, the macrophages pluck out the Heinz bodies.As a result, some of these partially devoured cells retain an abnormal shape i.e. as if a bite wastaken out of them. Such cells are called bite cells. Bite cells are trapped in splenic cords andremoved by phagocytes leading to extravascular hemolysis.The images given below show Heinz bodies and bite cells seen in G6PD deficiency.OMARROWHeinz bodies-Heinz body404OMARROWBite cellsMBite cell",

      "explanation": "Acute hemolysis in G6PD deficiency is intravascular. This is marked by anaemia,hemoglobinemia, and hemoglobinuria.These episodes are self-limited and intermittent. Reticulocytosis occurs during the recovery phase.Hence, features related to chronic hemolysis (e.g., splenomegaly, cholelithiasis) are absent.",

      "explanation": "The peripheral smear shows RBCs with anisopoikilocytosis with polychromasia and many bitecells (arrows) suggestive of G6PD deficiency. This condition is protective against Plasmodium405falciparum malaria.Malarial parasites preferentially invade RBCs which are rich in G6PD. G6PD deficiency causesoxidative stress and hemolysis, preferably in the older RBCs. Reticulocytes and youngerythrocytes have much higher G6PD activities and are less susceptible to oxidant damage.P. falciparum can invade erythrocytes of all ages. P. vivax, and P. ovale invade reticulocytes(immature erythrocytes) preferentially. Hence, a low G6PD level in older RBC is protective againstP. falciparum malaria.Episodic hemolysis in this condition can be triggered by fava beans which is a staple in Egyptiancuisine.The images given below show Heinz bodies and bite cells seen in G6PD deficiency.",

      "explanation": "OMARROWOMARROW-Heinz bodyM-Bite cell406Hemolysis in G6PD-deficiency anemia does not continue for the entire period that the patienttakes the offending drug. It stops after a few days.Two variants of G6PD, designated as G6PD- and G6PD Mediterranean, cause most of theclinically significant hemolytic anemias. The half-life of G6PD- is moderately reduced, whereasthat of G6PD Mediterranean is markedly reduced; hence, the severity of deficiency is greater withthe Mediterranean variant. The most common normal variant is G6PD B.The hemolysis in G6PD deficiency is both extravascular and intravascular hemolysis. Thedamaged red cells are sequestered in the spleen and killedby macrophages, causing extravascular hemolysis. The oxidative stresses can denaturehemoglobin, resulting in intravascular hemolysis.In individuals with G6PD deficiency, acute intravascular hemolysis begins 2 to 3 days afterexposure to oxidants. Only older RBCs are at risk for lysis. The hemolytic episode isself-limited because hemolysis stops when only younger G6PD-replete red cells remain, even if thepatient continues to take the offending drug.",

Most of thecausative antibodies in this condition belong to the IgG class.Immunohemolytic anaemia is caused by antibodies that cause premature destruction of the redcells.

      "explanation": "The type of hemolysis seen in the different immunohemolytic anemia are:Autoimmune hemolytic anemias (AIHA) cause both extravascular and intravascular hemolysis.In warm antibody type, hemolysis is extravascular. IgG-coated red cells are phagocytosed anddestroyed in the spleen.In cold agglutinin type, hemolysis is extravascular and intravascular. In the peripheral vascularbed (low temperature), IgM binds to the red cells. This causes agglutination andcomplement-fixing. They are unbound when they reach the general circulation. However, the IgMinteraction causes deposition of sublytic quantities of C3b. It is an excellent opsonin, which leadsto the removal of RBCs by phagocytes in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow.Cold hemolysin type is a rare subtype of AIHA. Hemolysis is intravascular. IgG binds to the Pblood group antigen on the red cells, which leads to complement-mediated lysis.407TypeWarm antibodyHemolysisExtravascularCold agglutini Extravascular and intravasculnCold hemolysarIntravascularin",

LDH may be increasedwhen there is hemolysis.Two different mechanisms for drug-induced immune hemolytic anemias are:Antigenic drugs:• Anemia occurs 1-2 weeks after initiation of large IV dose of the offending drug•••These drugs bind to red cell membrane and are recognised by anti-drug antibodiesThey can cause both extravascular and intravascular hemolysis⚫ E.g. penicillin, cephalosporins, quinidineTolerance-breaking drugs:• Antibodies are produced against red cell antigens, particularly Rh antigens• E.g. alpha-methyl dopa",
