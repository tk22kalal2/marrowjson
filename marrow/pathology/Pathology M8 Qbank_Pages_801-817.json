Neutrophil-rich casts (puscasts) indicate renal involvement because casts are formed only in tubules.The urine contains many leukocytes (pyuria) derived from the inflammatory infiltrate. It is foundin both upper and lower UTIs and cannot differentiate between them. Fever is also a non-specificfinding.Ascending infection is the most common cause of clinical pyelonephritis.Note: Sterile pyuria is defined as white cells in the urine in the absence of significant bacterialgrowth.

However, patients with autosomalrecessive (childhood) polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) have congenital hepatic fibrosis.ADPKD is associated with mutations in PKD1, encoding polycystin 1, and PKD2, encodingpolycystin 2. The multiple expanding cysts of both kidneys ultimately destroy the renalparenchyma and cause renal failure. Cysts arise from the tubules throughout the nephron and,therefore, have variable lining epithelia.The common extrarenal manifestations of ADPKD include:• Hepatic cysts most common• Seminal vesicle cysts can result in infertility-• Arachnoid membrane cysts - usually asymptomatic, may increase the risk of subdural hematoma• Pancreatic cysts• Splenic cysts• Intracranial berry aneurysms⚫ Subarachnoid hemorrhages••• Mitral valve prolapseThere are very few case reports with lung cysts in ADPKD patients, but the association betweenADPKD and lung cysts has not been proved.

It is expressed intubular epithelial cells, particularly those of the distal nephron. It contains domains that areusually involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Mutations in PKD1 account for about85% of cases of ADPKD (autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease) and it causes a moresevere form of the disease.Polycystin-2 is an integral membrane protein that is expressed in all segments of the renal tubulesand in many extrarenal tissues. It functions as a Ca2+ cation channel. Overall, it causes a lesssevere form of ADPKD disease.",
