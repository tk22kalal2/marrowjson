      "explanation": "The gain of function mutations in NOD-Like receptors (NLRs) result in periodic fever syndromescalled autoinflammatory syndromes.They are a group of clinical conditions characterised by recurrent inflammatory episodes. Thisdisorder is marked by abnormally increased inflammation, mediated predominantly by cells andmolecules of the innate immune system, with a significant host predisposition.NOD-like receptors are cytosolic receptors that signal via a cytosolic multiprotein complex calledthe inflammasome. This activates caspase-1 that generates biologically active form of interleukin-1(IL-1). IL-1 is a mediator of inflammation that recruits leukocytes and induces fever. Theautoinflammatory syndromes respond very well to treatment with IL-1 antagonists.Note: Autoimmune diseases result from T and B-lymphocyte reactions against self-antigens.",

      "explanation": "Normal CD4+: CD8+ T lymphocyte ratio is 2:1. Approximately 60% of mature T cells are CD4+and about 30% are CD8+.T-lymphocytes (thymus-derived cells) constitute 60-70% of peripheral blood lymphocytes. T-cellprogenitors are derived from the bone marrow, but travel to the thymus, where they mature. Tcells can be divided into three main subtypes:They are located in the paracortical areas of lymph nodes and the periarteriolar sheaths ofthe spleen. They have an antigen-specific T-cell receptors (TCR) which have alpha/betapolypeptide chains components. Demonstration of TCR gene rearrangement by southern blot is amolecular marker of T-cell lineage.The CD molecules present on T cells are CD1, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8 and CD28. CD3 isinvolved in signal transduction and is also called a pan T-cell marker.

They express many receptors for capturingand responding to microbes (and other antigens), including toll-like receptors (TLRs) and lectins.They also express high levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) for presenting antigensto and activating T cells.In response to microbes, dendritic cells are recruited to the T-cell zones of lymphoid organs. Here,they present antigens to T cells with help of MHC.Similar cells with dendritic morphology in the germinal centers of lymphoid follicles in the spleenand lymph nodes are follicular dendritic cells. They bear Fc receptors for IgG and receptors forC3b.

      "explanation": "Macrophages are components of both innate and acquired immunity.They phagocytose microbes and protein antigens. They process the antigens and present thepeptide fragments to T cells. Thus, macrophages function as antigen-presenting cells in T-cellactivation.They also participate in the effector phase of humoral immunity. Macrophages efficientlyphagocytose and destroy microbes that are opsonized (coated) with IgG or C3b.They are key effector cells in certain forms of cell-mediated immunity to eliminate intracellularmicrobes.

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Both cytotoxic T-cells and NK cells are effective against virus-infected cells.The NK cells have different mechanisms of action while killing target cells.NK cells can lyse IgG-coated target cells by binding to the Fc tail of IgG, through the CD16receptor expressed on NK cells. This phenomenon is known as antibody-dependent cellularcytotoxicity (ADCC).NK cells secrete various cytokines such as interferon-y (IFN-y), which activate macrophages todestroy ingested microbes.Target cell destruction by NK cells is also mediated through two others receptors - activatingreceptors and inhibitory receptors.The activating receptors enable NK cells to recognize infected and stressed cells. The inhibitoryreceptors recognize self class-I MHC molecules, that are expressed on all healthy cells therebypreventing NK cells from killing normal cells. Virus infection / neoplastic transformationoverexpresses the activating receptors and simultaneously reduces the expression of class-I MHCmolecules. As a result, NK cells are activated and the infected cells are killed.CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes directly kill damaged cells.The differences between NK cells and cytotoxic T-cells are:Natural killer (NK) cellCytotoxic T-cellsDoes not requirepriming -rap requirepriming -takes days toid response in hoursrespond269Natural killer (NK) cellMHC unrestrictedAntibody-mediated and non-antibody-mediated killingKills virus-infected and neoplastic cells by apoptosisAntigen non-specificMemory is absentCytotoxic T-cellsMHC restrictedNon-antibody mediated killing/direct cytotoxicityKills virus-infected, neoplastic, and donor graft cells by apoptosisAntigen-specificMemory is present",

They include:•Antigens displayed by APCs in the form of peptides bound to MHCmolecules, that are recognised by T-cell receptors• Costimulatory signal (as it stimulates T cells in conjunction with antigen) provided by moleculeson APCs that engage particular costimulatory receptors on T cellsIn the absence of costimulation, T cells that recognize antigen either fail to respond and die orenter a state of unresponsiveness known as anergy.
