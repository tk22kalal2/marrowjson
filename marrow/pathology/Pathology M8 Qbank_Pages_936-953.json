With treatment, lifeexpectancy is normal.Bantu siderosis or African iron overload is due to dietary iron overload. Consumption of beerprepared in iron pots or drums is the cause of dietary iron overload.Skin pigmentation in hemochromatosis mostly results from increased melanin synthesis.

These are characteristic of alpha-1 antitrypsindeficiency.It is an autosomal-recessive disorder of protein misfolding that results in impaired secretion of α1antitrypsin into the serum. α1AT deficiency results in excessive degradation of alveoli byneutrophil elastase causing panacinar emphysema. It also causes liver disease as a consequence ofan abnormal accumulation of the misfolded protein within hepatocytes. Cutaneous necrotizingpanniculitis also occurs in a minor subset of patients. Hepatocellular carcinoma develops in 2% to3% of cases.The image given is a photomicrograph of a liver biopsy from a patient with alpha-1 antitrypsindeficiency.
