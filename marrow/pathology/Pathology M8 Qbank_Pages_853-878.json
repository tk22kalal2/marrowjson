      "explanation": "Lungs are the most common site of metastasis in gestational choriocarcinoma.It is followed by the vagina, brain, liver, bone, and kidney in descending order of frequency.Gestational choriocarcinomas are malignant neoplasm of trophoblastic cells derived from apreviously normal or abnormal pregnancy, such as an extrauterine ectopic pregnancy. The hCGlevels are elevated to levels above those encountered in hydatidiform moles. Itshows hematogenous spread. It is rapidly invasive and metastasizes widely.Gestational choriocarcinomas are chemosensitive whereas non-gestational choriocarcinomas arechemoresistant.",

      "explanation": "Malignant mixed Müllerian tumors (MMMTs) are carcinosarcomas whose genetic profileclosely resembles endometrial carcinomas.They involve mutations in the same genes - PTEN, TP53, and PIK3CA. The usual geneticalterations found in sarcomas are absent in MMMTs.MMMTs are endometrial adenocarcinomas with malignant mesenchymal components. Themesenchymal component may resemble uterine mesenchymal elements (stromal sarcoma,leiomyosarcoma) or contain heterologous malignant cell types (striated muscle, cartilage, adiposetissue, and bone).It occurs in postmenopausal women and presents with bleeding. It is associated with a pooroutcome.",

They may occur inchildhood, but most commonly occur in the 2-3rd decades. It may occur in patients with gonadaldysgenesis, including pseudohermaphroditism. The majority of these tumors are unilateral. Theyexpress OCT-3, OCT4, and NANOG.All dysgerminomas are malignant, but the degree of histologic atypia is variable. Only aboutone-third of these lesions are aggressive. These neoplasms are responsive to chemoradiation, andoverall survival exceeds 80%.877878",
