      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Red neurons are the earliest morphologic markers of neuronal cell death. Acute neuronal injury refers to a spectrum of changes that accompany acute CNS hypoxia/ischemia or other acute insults and reflect the earliest morphologic markers of neuronal cell death. They are evident by about 12 to 24 hours after an irreversible insult. Morphologic features consist of: • Shrinkage of the cell body • Pyknosis of the nucleus • Disappearance of the nucleolus • Loss of Nissl substance • Intense eosinophilia of the cytoplasm. Stages of neuronal injury and their pathological features are given below: Stages - Early change, Time - 12-24 hr, Subacute change - 24 hr-2 weeks, Repair - 2 weeks +. Features - Red neuron, Necrosis, macrophages, vascular proliferation, gliosis, Removal of necrosis, gliosis completed, loss of CNS architecture.",

Rosenthal fibers are thick, elongated, brightly eosinophilic, irregular structures that occur within astrocytic processes. They contain two heat-shock proteins (αB crystallin and HSP27) as well as ubiquitin. They are typically found in regions of longstanding gliosis and are characteristic of a type of glial tumor - pilocytic astrocytoma. Alexander disease is a leukodystrophy associated with mutations in the gene encoding GFAP. In this condition, abundant Rosenthal fibers are found in periventricular, perivascular, and subpial locations.",

      "explanation": "In a patient with a known history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, the most common type of intracranial aneurysm is a saccular aneurysm. Although the majority occur sporadically, genetic factors may be important in their pathogenesis of saccular aneurysms. There is an increased incidence of saccular aneurysm in individuals with certain Mendelian disorders, like autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, neurofibromatosis type 1 [NF1], and Marfan syndrome, fibromuscular dysplasia of extracranial arteries, and coarctation of the aorta. Other predisposing factors include cigarette smoking and hypertension. The most frequent cause of clinically significant subarachnoid hemorrhage is the rupture of a saccular (berry) aneurysm in a cerebral artery.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an autosomal-dominant disorder caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene. This leads to the misfolding of the extracellular domain of the NOTCH3 receptor that is preferentially expressed in vascular smooth muscle. It is clinically characterized by recurrent strokes (usually ischemic, less often hemorrhages) and dementia. Arteries in the CNS and in other tissues such as skin show concentric thickening of the media and adventitia, loss of smooth muscle cells, and the presence of basophilic, periodic acid Schiff (PAS)-positive deposits. Deposits contain the misfolded NOTCH3 protein. These appear as osmiophilic compact granular material on electron microscopy and are consistently detected in the walls of affected vessels.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an encephalitis caused by the JC polyomavirus. The disease occurs almost exclusively in immunosuppressed individuals, most commonly among patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The most prominent symptoms are clumsiness, progressive weakness, and visual, speech, and personality changes. Since the virus preferentially infects oligodendrocytes, demyelination is its principal pathological effect. It affects the subcortical white matter, particularly that of the parietal and occipital lobes. On microscopic examination, enlarged oligodendrocyte nuclei containing glassy amphophilic viral inclusions are seen.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The above image shows lymphocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils surrounding the Toxoplasma bradyzoites encased in cysts. Along with the case scenario, the most likely diagnosis is cerebral toxoplasmosis. Cerebral toxoplasmosis is an opportunistic infection commonly found in the setting of HIV-associated immunosuppression. Toxoplasmosis of the CNS produces brain abscesses, which are found most often in the cerebral cortex (near the grey-white junction) and deep gray nuclei. Lesions of acute cerebral toxoplasmosis exhibit central necrosis, petechial hemorrhages surrounded by acute and chronic inflammation, macrophage infiltration, and vascular proliferation. Both free tachyzoites and encysted bradyzoites may be found at the periphery of the necrotic foci. Chronic lesions consist of small cystic spaces containing scattered lipid and hemosiderin-laden macrophages that are surrounded by gliotic brain. Option A: In cerebral malaria caused by P. falciparum, brain vessels are plugged with parasitized red cells. Around the vessels, ring hemorrhages and small focal inflammatory reactions (called malarial or Dürck granulomata) are seen. Option C: Herpes simplex encephalitis is necrotizing and often hemorrhagic. Cowdry type A intranuclear viral inclusion bodies may be found in both neurons and glia. Option D: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an encephalitis caused by the JC polyomavirus. The disease occurs almost exclusively in immunosuppressed individuals. The virus preferentially infects oligodendrocytes and hence demyelination is its principal pathologic effect. The enlarged oligodendrocyte nuclei contain glassy amphophilic viral inclusions.",

        "D": "The disease-causing isoform of prion protein is PrPC"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The disease-causing isoform of prion protein is PrPSc. Prions are the proteinaceous infectious particles that lack nucleic acid, composed entirely of alternatively folded proteins that undergo self-propagation. They bind to the normal, cellular isoform of the prion protein (PrPC), which is rich in α-helix, and stimulate conversion of PrPC into the disease-causing isoform PrPSc, which contains less α-helix and a high amount of β-structure. Structured proteins are resistant to digestion by human cellular enzymes. Transmission of prion disease may be sporadic, familial, or iatrogenic. This group of diseases includes: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome, Fatal Familial Insomnia, Kuru disease, Scrapie in sheep and goats, and Bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cows. The most common prion disease in humans is CJD, which is most commonly sporadic. CJD is characterized by a constellation of dementia, myoclonus, and periodic electrical bursts in EEG. Autoclaving at 134 degrees Celsius for 5 hours or treatment with 2 N NaOH for several hours is recommended for sterilization against prions.",

As an aneurysm develops, it typically forms a neck with a dome and the arterial internal elastic lamina disappears at the base of the neck. The media thins and connective tissue replaces the smooth-muscle cells. The site of rupture is most often the dome. Here the wall thins, and the tear that allows bleeding is usually ≤0.5 mm long. Risk of aneurysm rupture is higher if: Aneurysm is >7 mm in diameter, Aneurysm at the top of the basilar artery, Aneurysm at the origin of the posterior communicating artery.",
