Flexible cystoscopy revealed yellow-brown soft plaques with acentral umbilication. Microscopy of the plaque showed Michaelis-Gutmann bodies. What isthe likely diagnosis?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "This clinical scenario with the presence of Michaelis-Gutmann bodies is suggestive ofmalakoplakia.Malakoplakia is a chronic inflammatory reaction resulting from acquired defects in phagocytefunction, commonly affecting the urinary bladder. It can also be seen in other organ systems likethe gastrointestinal tract, female genital tract, and central nervous system.It is seen in chronic bacterial infection, mostly by Escherichia coli or occasionally Proteusspecies.Grossly, it presents as soft, yellow-brown, slightly raised mucosal plaques. Microscopically, thefollowing findings are seen:848• Large, foamy macrophages containing -• Abundant granular cytoplasm due to undigested bacterial products•Michaelis-Gutmann bodies - PAS-positive basophilic concretions due to iron and calciumdeposits in lysosomes• Occasional multinucleated giant cells and lymphocytesMalakoplakia - Michaelis-Gutmann bodiesaMichaelis-GutmannbodiesNote: Xanthogranulomatous cystitis is morphologically and probably pathogenetically similar tomalakoplakia, but it lacks Michaelis-Gutmann bodies.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The most common cause of polypoid cystitis is indwelling catheters.Polypoid cystitis is an inflammatory lesion resulting from mucosal irritation. It may also beassociated with radiation therapy and malignant tumors. It usually involves the posterior wall ofthe bladder.Grossly, it may show bulbous or papillary appearance and may be confused with papillaryurothelial carcinoma. Microscopically, the papillary projections are broad-based, non-branching,and without atypia. Stroma is edematous with minimal inflammation.Options A and D: Adenovirus infection and the use of anti-cancer drugs like cyclophosphamidecause hemorrhagic cystitis.Option B: Systemic allergic disorders cause eosinophilic cystitis.",

      "explanation": "849Malakoplakia is not a metaplastic lesion of the bladder. It is a type of chronic granulomatouscystitis due to defective phagocytic function that may mimic malignancy.Metaplastic lesions of the bladder include the following:• Nests of urothelium (Brunn nests) may grow downward into the lamina propria resulting in thefollowing lesions -• Cystitis glandularis - epithelial cells in the center of the nest undergo metaplasia and take on acuboidal or columnar appearance••Cystitis cystica - epithelial cells retract to produce cystic spaces lined by flattened urotheliumSquamous metaplasia - in response to injury, urothelium is replaced by stratified squamousepithelium.•Nephrogenic adenoma - due to implantation of shed renal tubular cells at sites of injuredurothelium, resulting in replacement of urothelium by cuboidal epithelium with a papillarygrowth pattern",

      "explanation": "The image shows oval-shaped eggs with the terminal spine which is characteristic of Schistosomahaematobium. It is most commonly associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder.The ova are deposited in the bladder wall and incite a brisk chronic inflammatory response. Thisinduces progressive mucosal squamous metaplasia and dysplasia and, in some instances,neoplasia.Schistosomal infection can less frequently result in adenocarcinoma or transitional cellcarcinoma.",
