      "explanation": "Alcohol abuse is strongly associated with the development of dilated cardiomyopathy. Alcohol and its metabolites, especially acetaldehyde, have a direct toxic effect on the myocardium, which leads to the development of dilated cardiomyopathy. Causes of dilated cardiomyopathy: Acquired causes include infectious and non-infectious myocarditis, which is the most common cause globally. Alcohol is the most common cause in India. Other causes include pregnancy-associated cardiomyopathy (PACM) and peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM), stress-induced Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, drug-induced causes such as doxorubicin (anthracycline), trastuzumab, cyclophosphamide, nutritional deficiencies like beriberi (thiamine), Keshan disease (selenium), and carnitine deficiency. Endocrine causes include hypo- and hyperthyroidism, acromegaly, and diabetes mellitus. Other causes are cobalt toxicity and heavy metals (lead, mercury, arsenic, lithium). Familial causes (50%) include mutation in the cardiac myocyte titin gene, haemochromatosis, and syndromes like Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Becker's muscular dystrophy.",

It is a type of dilated cardiomyopathy. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is also called broken heart syndrome, apical ballooning syndrome, or stress-induced cardiomyopathy. During extreme psychological stress, there is a catecholamine surge. This causes microcirculation spasms which lead to a transient myocardial stunning. It is usually seen in middle-aged women. It leads to left ventricular contractile dysfunction. The left ventricular apex is most often affected, which leads to apical ballooning. This resembles a 'takotsubo,' which is Japanese for 'fishing pot for trapping octopus.' Histologically, acute cases may show microscopic areas of necrosis characterized by myocyte hypercontraction known as contraction band necrosis. Chronic cases may exhibit microscopic foci of granulation tissue.",

ARVC is associated with Naxos syndrome. ARVC is an autosomal dominant cardiomyopathy characterized by fibrofatty replacement in the myocardium of the ventricles. It most commonly affects the right ventricle. It is due to mutations in the gene encoding desmosome-associated protein plakophilin 2. This leads to defective cell-adhesion proteins in the desmosomes that link adjacent cardiac myocytes. As shown in the image below, Naxos syndrome is characterized by woolly hair and palmoplantar hyperkeratosis. Morphology shows severe thinning of the right ventricular wall due to loss of myocytes, accompanied by extensive fatty infiltration and fibrosis. The image given below is a gross photograph of the heart showing a dilated right ventricle and near-transmural replacement of its free wall with fat and fibrosis. Carvajal syndrome is a variant of Naxos disease but is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and autopsy findings are suggestive of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The image given is a histologic section of cardiac muscle showing myocyte disarray and extreme hypertrophy as seen in HCM. HCM is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults. It is defined as left ventricular hypertrophy of >15mm on ECHO. The left ventricular myocardium is poorly compliant. This leads to abnormal diastolic filling and intermittent ventricular outflow obstruction, i.e., primarily diastolic dysfunction. The gross features of HCM are: â€¢ Massive myocardial hypertrophy usually without ventricular dilation. Asymmetric septal hypertrophy - disproportionate thickening of the ventricular septum relative to the left ventricle free wall â€¢ Banana-shaped left ventricle - due to bulging of the ventricular septum into the lumen. The image given below shows changes in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy compared to a normal heart. HCM shows asymmetric septal hypertrophy and thickened left ventricle wall. Aortic valve, Right atrium, Tricuspid valve, Right ventricle, Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Normal, Arch of aorta, Left atrium, Mitral valve, Left ventricle, Interventricular septum, Turbulent blood flow, Increased approximation of the interventricular septum with the mitral valve, Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Small left ventricle, Thickened interventricular septum. Histologic features of the HCM are: â€¢ Massive myocyte hypertrophy - with transverse myocyte diameters frequently greater than 40um, normal is approximately 15 Âµm. â€¢ Myofiber disarray - haphazard disarray of bundles of myocytes, individual myocytes, and contractile elements in sarcomeres within cells â€¢ Interstitial fibrosis and replacement fibrosis.

      "explanation": "In this scenario, the decrease in ventricular compliance indicates restrictive cardiomyopathy. Endocardial fibroelastosis is an uncommon restrictive heart condition characterized by fibroelastic thickening that typically involves the left ventricular endocardium. It is most common in the first 2 years of life. It results from several different insults, including viral infections (e.g., intrauterine exposure to mumps) or mutations in the gene for tafazzin. These mutations affect mitochondrial inner membrane integrity. Endomyocardial fibrosis is a disease of children and young adults in Africa and other tropical areas. It is characterized by fibrosis of the ventricular endocardium and subendocardium that extends from the apex upward. The etiology is unknown. Loeffler endomyocarditis results in endomyocardial fibrosis, typically with large mural thrombi. The overall morphology is similar to the tropical disease. In addition to the cardiac changes, there is often peripheral eosinophilia and eosinophilic infiltrates in multiple organs, including the heart.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario suggests post-myocardial infarction fibrinous pericarditis. It is the most common type of pericarditis. Clinically, there is a loud pericardial friction rub. There is a rubbery fibrin mass loosely gluing the parietal and visceral pericardium together (bread and butter). It may resolve or become organized to produce adhesive pericarditis. It is usually seen following: Myocardial infarction, Rheumatic fever, Trauma, Uremia, Radiation, Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and Severe pneumonia. Types of acute pericarditis: Serous pericarditis: There is a mild inflammation of epicardial and pericardial surfaces. Both acute and chronic inflammatory cells are present. There is exudative serous fluid, usually 50â€“200 mL. Thus, it develops slowly and rarely alters cardiac function. It is caused by: Rheumatic fever, SLE, Systemic scleroderma, Tumors, Uremia, Viral infection, Tuberculosis. Suppurative/purulent pericarditis: It may be due to bacterial, mycotic, or parasitic invasion. The inflammation may extend into the surrounding mediastinum. It usually results in organization and, therefore, constrictive pericarditis with clinical sequelae. The entry of the pathogen into the pericardium may be by: direct extension, seeding from blood, lymphatic spread, or seeding by instrumentation. Hemorrhagic pericarditis: It can be due to tuberculosis or a malignant neoplasm (from lung or breast). It can also be seen following cardiac surgery.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Cardiac myxoma is seen in 30-40% of Carney complex patients. Null mutations in the PRKAR1A gene are seen in Carney's complex. Familial syndromes associated with myxomas have activating mutations in the GNAS1 gene or null mutations in PRKAR1A. Mutations in GNAS1 are associated with McCune-Albright syndrome. The PRKAR1A gene encodes a regulatory subunit of a cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase (Carney complex). Skin lesions are the most common manifestation of the Carney complex. The most common type of endocrine tumor in the Carney complex is the primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD). It is a form of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia that leads to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-independent Cushing syndrome. NAME syndrome and LAMB syndrome are subsets of the Carney complex. The LAMB acronym refers to lentigines, atrial myxoma, and blue nevi. NAME refers to nevi, atrial myxoma, myxoid neurofibromas, and ephelids. Components of Carney Complex: â€¢ Skin pigmented lesions (lentigines, blue nevi, other) â€¢ Myxomas (cutaneous, mucosal, cardiac, other) â€¢ PPNAD (Cushing Syndrome) â€¢ GH-PRL-producing adenomas (acromegaly) â€¢ Leydig or Sertoli cell tumors â€¢ Ovarian cystadenoma or carcinoma â€¢ Thyroid adenoma or cancer â€¢ Psammomatous melanotic schwannoma â€¢ Breast ductal adenoma â€¢ Osteochondromyxoma â€¢ Cancers (liver, pancreas, adrenal) Carney triad: â€¢ Extra-adrenal paraganglioma â€¢ Gastrointestinal stromal tumor â€¢ Pulmonary chondroma Carney-Stratakis Syndrome: Familial paraganglioma and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)",

      "explanation": "Atrial myxomas most commonly occur in the left atrium. Myxoma is usually single, but can rarely be multiple. The region of the fossa ovalis in the atrial septum is the favoured site of origin. Mobile tumours exert a 'wrecking-ball' effect, causing damage to the valve leaflets. They can be sporadic or familial. The image given below shows a gross picture of an atrial cardiac myxoma arising from the region of the fossa ovalis and extending to the mitral valve orifice: Sporadic Type Myxoma - Single.

      "explanation": "The given histological slide shows abundant spider cells. They are seen in rhabdomyoma. Microscopically, they are composed of bizarre, markedly enlarged myocytes. Routine histologic processing often artifactually reduces the abundant cytoplasm to thin strands that stretch from the nucleus to the surface membrane. This appearance is referred to as 'spider' cells. Rhabdomyoma is the most frequent primary tumor of the pediatric heart. 50% of cases are associated with tuberous sclerosis, with mutations in the tumor-suppressor genes TSC1 and TSC2. They are usually multiple and occur in ventricles preferentially. They often regress spontaneously and may, therefore, be considered as hamartomas.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The single most important long-term limitation of cardiac transplantation is allograft arteriopathy. Complications following cardiac transplantation: Allograft rejection: It is the primary concern that requires close surveillance. Both classic cellular rejection and antibody-mediated rejection are recognized. Cellular rejection is characterized by interstitial lymphocytic inflammation, with associated myocyte damage. Allograft arteriopathy: It is the single most important long-term limitation for cardiac transplantation. It is a late, progressive, diffusely stenosing intimal proliferation in the coronary arteries, leading to ischemic injury. It can lead to silent myocardial infarction since transplant patients have denervated hearts and do not experience angina. Progressive congestive heart failure and sudden cardiac death can also occur. Other postoperative problems include infection and malignancies, especially Epstein-Barr virus-associated B-cell lymphomas. The image given below shows allograft arteriopathy. There is severe diffuse concentric intimal thickening producing critical stenosis. The internal elastic lamina and media are intact (Movat pentachrome stain, elastin black).",

        "D": "A patient who is a marathon runner who came for a pre-run evaluation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "In the given scenario, a marathon runner will have cardiac hypertrophy with increased capillary density. Aerobic exercise, e.g., long-distance running, is associated with volume-load hypertrophy accompanied by an increase in capillary density. This is not seen in other forms of hypertrophy. This decreases resting heart rate and blood pressure. In hypertrophy due to pressure or volume overload, there is a sustained increase in mechanical work. This causes myocytes to increase in size, thus increasing the size and weight of the heart. The hypertrophied heart has an increased oxygen consumption but decreased supply. This is because hypertrophy is not accompanied by a proportional increase in capillary numbers. This leads to ischemia-related decompensation, which can evolve to cardiac failure and eventually lead to death. The causes and consequences of hypertrophy are summarized in the below image. Causes and consequences of cardiac hypertrophy: Conditions causing pressure or volume overload - Valvular disease, Hypertension, Myocardial infarction. Leads to increased cardiac work - Cardiac wall stretches, Leads to cardiac hypertrophy - Heart size and mass increases, Protein synthesis increases, Fibrosis occurs, Blood supply compromised. Leads to cardiac function impairment - Systolic/diastolic heart failure, Arrhythmias may occur, Neuro-humoral stimulation may occur. Heart weight, rather than wall thickness, is the best measure of hypertrophy in dilated hearts. A patient with systemic hypertension has pressure-overload hypertrophy. A patient with an echo finding of an aortic valvular area of 0.6cmÂ² is suggestive of aortic stenosis. There is pressure-overload hypertrophy. A patient with a high-pitched holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex is suggestive of mitral regurgitation. There is volume-overload hypertrophy.",
