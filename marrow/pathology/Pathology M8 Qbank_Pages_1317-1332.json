      "explanation": "The given clinical history and the image showing Rosenthal fibers is diagnostic of pilocytic astrocytoma. It belongs to WHO grade I tumors. Pilocytic astrocytoma typically occurs in children and young adults and is usually located in the cerebellum. It is usually a slow-growing tumor and if it occurs in the cerebellum, it can be resected. If it extends into the hypothalamic region from the optic tract, it can have a more ominous clinical course because of its location. It is often cystic; if solid, it may be well circumscribed. It is often biphasic with both loose microcystic and fibrillary areas. The tumor is composed of bipolar cells with long, thin hair-like processes that are GFAP-positive and form dense fibrillary meshworks. Rosenthal fibers and eosinophilic granular bodies are characteristic findings under microscopy. BRAF mutation is seen in this tumor.",

Oligodendroglioma is an infiltrating glioma comprised of cells that resemble oligodendrocytes. It commonly occurs in the fourth and fifth decades. The lesion is found mostly in the cerebral hemispheres, with a predilection for white matter. The tumor is composed of sheets of regular cells with spherical nuclei containing finely granular chromatin (similar to normal oligodendrocytes) surrounded by a clear halo of vacuolated cytoplasm, giving a fried egg appearance. Tumor cells infiltrating the cerebral cortex often collect around the neurons (perineuronal satellitosis). Fried eggs in pathology: Oligodendroglioma on histopathology, hairy cell leukemia on bone marrow biopsy, seminoma/dysgerminoma on light microscopy, and Mycoplasma pneumonia fried egg colonies on Eaton agar.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Duret hemorrhages are characteristic of transtentorial herniation. Transtentorial (uncinate, mesial temporal) herniation occurs when the medial aspect of the temporal lobe is compressed against the free margin of the tentorium. Progression of transtentorial herniation is often accompanied by secondary hemorrhagic lesions in the midbrain and pons, termed Duret hemorrhages. These linear or flame-shaped lesions usually occur in the midline and paramedian regions and are believed to be due to the distortion or tearing of penetrating veins and arteries supplying the upper brainstem. With increasing displacement of the temporal lobe, the third cranial nerve is compromised, resulting in pupillary dilation and impairment of ocular movements on the side of the lesion. The posterior cerebral artery may also be compressed, resulting in ischemic injury to the territory supplied by that vessel, including the primary visual cortex. When the extent of herniation is large enough, the contralateral cerebral peduncle may be compressed, resulting in hemiparesis ipsilateral to the side of the herniation. The compression in the peduncle in this setting is known as the Kernohan notch.",

Leptomeningeal metastases, also known as carcinomatous meningitis, refer to the spread of malignant cells through the CSF space. These cells can originate both in primary CNS tumors (e.g., drop-metastases), as well as from distant tumors that have metastasized (hematogenous spread).
