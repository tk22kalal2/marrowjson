      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria is not a preleukemic condition.It is an autoimmune hemolytic anemia due to IgG autoantibodies that bind to the P blood groupantigen and cause intravascular hemolysis and hemoglobinuria. Most cases are seen in childrenand show recovery within a month.Option A: Few patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) develop acutenon-lymphocytic leukemia. This is thought to arise from the injured marrow as a secondaryhematopoietic disorder.Option B: Bone marrow aplasia preceding acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a rare conditionthat usually affects children. It generally follows the recovery of normal blood counts and mostcommonly occurs within 6 months of the onset of aplasia.Option C: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurs in 10% to 40% of individuals withmyelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). It is usually accompanied by the appearance of additionalcytogenetic abnormalities.",
