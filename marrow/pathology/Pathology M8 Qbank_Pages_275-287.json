      "explanation": "Arthus reaction is characterized by a localized area of tissue necrosis due toimmune-complex-mediated (type III hypersensitivity reaction) vasculitis in the skin.This reaction can be produced experimentally by intracutaneous injection of antigen in apreviously immunised animal that contains circulating antibodies against the antigen. As theantigen diffuses into the vessel wall, it binds with the preformed antibody, and immunecomplexes are formed locally. These complexes precipitate in the vessel walls and cause fibrinoidnecrosis.",

In a previously sensitizedindividual, reddening and induration of the site appear in 8 to 12 hours, reach a peak in 24 to 72hours, and thereafter slowly subside.Morphologically, delayed-type hypersensitivity is characterized by the accumulation ofmononuclear cells, mainly CD4+ T cells and macrophages, around venules.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Anaphylactoid reactions are those reactions that are similar to the anaphylactic reactions but arenot IgE mediated. These reactions are caused by direct degranulation of the mast cells orbasophils, which causes the release of mediators.Unlike the classic anaphylaxis which occurs on re-exposure to the allergen, the anaphylactoidreaction can occur even on the first exposure. The most common agents that can cause ananaphylactoid reaction include NSAIDs and radiocontrast media.In 2014, World Allergy Organisation has introduced two new terms:••Immunologic anaphylaxis - It includes anaphylactic reactions mediated by IgE, IgG (in animals),and immune complex/ complement-mediated reactions.•Non-immunologic anaphylaxis (previously called anaphylactoid reaction) - It includes reactionscaused by agents which cause massive degranulation of mast cells or basophils in the absence ofimmunoglobulin.The image given below shows the sequence of events in type 1 hypersensitivity reaction.Exposure toAllergensType 1 Hypersensitivity ReactionsAllergens(e.g. pollen)Mucosal liningDendritic cellsActivation of TH2cells and IgEclass switchingin B cellsProduction of IgEB cellIgEsecretingB cellsBinding of IgE toFoeRI on mast cellsRepeat exposureto allergenActivation of Mastcell; release ofmediatorsVasoactive amines,lipid mediatorsImmediate hypersensitivityreaction (minutes afterrepeat exposure to allergen)Mast cellMediatorsMARROWCytokinesIgENaiveT cellsTH2collsFOCRILate phase reaction(22-24 hours after repeatexposure toallergen)283",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The above process is called central tolerance and the AIRE (AutoImmune REgulator) protein isnecessary for this process.Immature self-reactive T and B lymphocyte clones recognize self-antigens during their maturationin the central lymphoid organs (thymus for T cells, bone marrow for B cells). They are killed orrendered harmless.The removal of self reacting T lymphocytes in the thymus is called negative selection/ deletion. Forthis process, AIRE protein is needed. Mutations in the AIRE gene results in autoimmunedisorders (autoimmune polyendocrinopathy).B cells undergo a process called receptor editing. When developing B cells encounter an antigen, itformulates a change in the receptor that makes the antigen unrecognizable. Self-reacting B cellscan also undergo apoptosis.",

      "explanation": "Autoimmunity in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is the result of polyclonal B cell activation.Microbes may induce other abnormalities that promote autoimmune reactions. Some viruses,such as EBV and HIV, cause polyclonal B-cell activation, which may result in the production ofautoantibodies.The role of infections in autoimmunity is exemplified by the following:• Molecular mimicry of antigenic cross-reactivity: The structural similarity of the microbialantigens and self-antigens. Rheumatic heart disease is an example in which streptococcal proteinscross-react with myocardial proteins causing myocarditis.•Upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules by infectious organisms.• Polyclonal B cell activation: Caused by EBV and HIV, resulting in the production ofautoantibodies..Alteration of tissue antigens: Infections may alter tissue self-antigens so that they activate T cellsand lose the property of self-tolerance.",
