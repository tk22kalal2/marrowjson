It is morecommon in the Asian population. It usually manifests in the 1st year of life. It causes acuteepisodes of hemolysis when triggered by infections or oxidant drugs.The decreased a chain production leads to a relative excess of ° chains.

Overall severity is more in homozygous HbS.Severity sequence is HbSS &gt; HbSC &gt; HbSA &gt; HbSF.In HbC, lysine is substituted for glutamate in the sixth amino acid residue of °-globin. Thepercentage of HbS is 50% in HbSC red cells and 40% in HbAS cells. Moreover, HbSC cells tend tolose salt and water and become dehydrated, which increases the intracellular concentration ofHbS. Both of these factors increase the tendency for HbS to polymerize. As a result, individualswho are compound heterozygotes for HbS and HbC, have symptomatic sickling disorder (termedHbSC disease). However, it is milder than sickle cell disease (HbSS).HbF inhibits the polymerization of HbS even more than HbA. Hence, infants do not becomesymptomatic until they reach 5 or 6 months of age when the level of HbF normally falls.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of sickle cell anaemia. HbS gives protection againstPlasmodium falciparum malaria.Hand-foot syndrome or dactylitis of bones of hands and feet is a severe acute inflammatoryresponse seen in sickle cell anaemia. It is caused by vaso-occlusive episodes leading to ischemiaand finally infarction of the distal portions of the extremities.395Sickle cells impair the formation of membrane knobs containing a protein made by P. falciparumcalled PfEMP-1. This decreases the adherence of infected red cells to the endothelium.Individuals with sickle cell trait are significantly less likely to have severe disease or to die frommalaria. It is because of the increased phagocytosis of sickled cells in the spleen, which keeps theparasite load down.The image given below shows sickle cells seen on peripheral smear in sickle cell anemia.Sickle Cell Anemia - Peripheral SmearSickle cells1000",

      "explanation": "The concurrence of sickle cell anaemia and α-thalassemia results in less severe hemolyticanaemia.Sickle cell anaemia is caused by point mutations in ° globin synthesis leading to defective HbSsynthesis. When these RBCs release oxygen, the HbS polymerises leading to membrane distortionThalassemia is due to germline mutations causing decreased globin chain synthesis (α or °). Sincethese diseases have a different pathogenesis, they can occur concurrently.In alpha-thalassemia, the concentration of hemoglobin is decreased. Therefore the concentrationof HbS in sickle cell anaemia is also decreased. Since HbS molecules should be close to each otherfor polymerization to occur. Since there is a decreased concentration of HbS in alpha-thalassemia,the HbS molecules are far apart. So there is a decreased polymerization of HbS and therefore lessseverity of the disease.",

      "explanation": "Aplastic crisis in sickle cell anaemia is caused by parvovirus B19. It is a transient arrest oferythropoiesis, usually triggered by an acute parvovirus infection. Parvovirus infects and kills red.cell precursors. It occurs in sickle cell disease and other hemolytic anaemias.396Vaso-occlusive crises (pain crises) are episodes of hypoxic injury and infarction that cause severepain in the affected region. The most commonly involved sites are the bones, lungs, liver, brain,spleen, and penis. Acute chest syndrome is a type of vaso-occlusive crisis involving the lungs. Ittypically presents with fever, cough, chest pain, and pulmonary infiltrates. Pulmonaryinflammation may cause blood flow to become sluggish and \"spleenlike,\" leading to sickling andvaso-occlusion.Sequestration crises occur in children with intact spleens. Massive entrapment of sickle red cellsleads to rapid splenic enlargement, hypovolemia, and sometimes shock. Both sequestration crisesand acute chest syndrome may be fatal and sometimes require prompt treatment with exchangetransfusions.",

Splenomegaly is seen in thalassemia and hereditary spherocytosis.In children with sickle cell anaemia, there is moderate splenomegaly. This is due to red pulpcongestion caused by the entrapment of sickled red cells. As age advances, chronic erythrostasisproduces hypoxic damage and infarcts. By adulthood, the spleen is reduced to a band of fibroustissue. This process is called autosplenectomy.397",
