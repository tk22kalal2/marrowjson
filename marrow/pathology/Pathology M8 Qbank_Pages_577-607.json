Hence, the histological picture is described as having a 'garden party' or 'college girl' appearance. Chronic myeloid leukemia is a myeloproliferative disorder with peak incidence in the 5th to 6th decades of life. It occurs due to the chimeric BCR-ABL gene. Clinical features of CML include hypermetabolism, fatigability, weakness, weight loss, and anorexia, as well as extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis causing splenomegaly, mild hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. Hematological findings include mild-to-moderate anemia, leukocytosis, and usually increased platelets. The DLC shows predominantly neutrophils, band forms, metamyelocytes, myelocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and blasts (>10%). Note: A 'convent girl' appearance is seen in CLL.",

Polycythemia denotes an abnormally high red cell count, usually with a corresponding increase in the hemoglobin level (> 16 ±2 g/dL). It is of two types: relative hemoconcentration due to decreased plasma volume, and an absolute increase in the total red cell mass. Causes of relative polycythemia include: dehydration - deprivation of water, prolonged vomiting or diarrhea, excessive use of diuretics; Gaisböck syndrome - stress polycythemia where affected individuals are usually hypertensive, obese, and anxious. Causes of absolute polycythemia include: primary - intrinsic abnormality of hematopoietic precursors; polycythemia vera; inherited erythropoietin receptor mutations; secondary red cell progenitors responding to increased levels of erythropoietin; compensatory due to cyanotic heart and lung disease, high altitude; paraneoplastic erythropoietin-secreting tumors.

Clinical features of polycythemia vera: • Headache • Hypertension • Dizziness • Intense pruritus, aquagenic pruritus • Peptic ulcer • Venous thrombosis - Budd-Chiari syndrome (hepatic vein thrombosis), bowel infarction, stroke, myocardial infarction • Minor hemorrhages - epistaxis, gum bleeding.

The WHO 5th edition diagnostic criteria (2022) for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) include: Prerequisite criteria: 1. Persistent absolute (≥0.5 × 10^9/L) and relative (≥10%) peripheral blood monocytosis. 2. Blasts constitute <20% of the cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. 3. Not meeting diagnostic criteria of chronic myeloid leukemia or other myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). 4. Not meeting diagnostic criteria of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with tyrosine kinase fusions. Supporting criteria: 1. Dysplasia involving ≥1 myeloid lineage. 2. Acquired clonal cytogenetic or molecular abnormality. 3. Abnormal partitioning of peripheral blood monocyte subsets. Pre-requisite criteria must be present in all cases: If monocytosis is ≥1 × 10^9/L: one or more supporting criteria must be met. If monocytosis is ≥0.5 and <1 × 10^9/L: supporting criteria 1 and 2 must be met. Subtype criteria: Myelodysplastic CMML (MD-CMML): WBC < 13 × 10^9/L. Myeloproliferative CMML (MP-CMML): WBC ≥ 13 × 10^9/L. Blasts and blast equivalents include myeloblasts, monoblasts, and promonocytes. MPN with monocytosis can mimic CMML. In these instances, a documented history of MPN excludes CMML. The presence of MPN features in the bone marrow and/or a high burden of MPN-associated mutations (JAK2, CALR, or MPL) tends to support MPN with monocytosis rather than CMML. Criteria for myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with tyrosine kinase fusions should be specifically excluded in cases with eosinophilia. Morphologic dysplasia should be present in ≥10% of cells of a hematopoietic lineage in the bone marrow.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Polycythemia vera is strongly associated with activating point mutations in the tyrosine kinase JAK2. A mutation in JAK2, a key member of the cytokine intracellular signaling pathway, can be found in 90-95% of patients with polycythemia vera. It is characterized by: \n   • Increased marrow production of red cells, granulocytes, and platelets (panmyelosis) \n   • Low erythropoietin levels and elevated hematocrit. \n   Blood viscosity and sludging lead to both thrombosis and bleeding. \n   • Headache, dizziness, hypertension, dizziness, venous thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome due to hepatic vein thrombosis), bowel infarction, and stroke. \n   • Intense pruritus, especially aquagenic pruritus. \n   • Peptic ulceration, hyperuricemia. \n   15% to 20% of patients after an average period of 10 years → Myelofibrosis and extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis, \n   • PCV transforms into AML in 2% of patients. \n   Primary myelofibrosis \n   • Marrow fibrosis associated with extramedullary hemopoiesis in the spleen. \n   • Activating mutation in JAK2 (more commonly) or MPL. \n   • Presence of neoplastic megakaryocytes, which are responsible for the release of fibrogenic factors like PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) and TGF-β. \n   • Bone marrow aspiration yields dry tap due to fibrosis of the bone marrow. \n   • So, bone marrow biopsy is the investigation of choice, which shows the presence of hypocellularity with increased deposition of reticulin inside the marrow, abnormal megakaryocytes, and the characteristic finding of dilated marrow sinusoids. \n   • Blood shows mild leukocytosis, decreased Hb and hematocrit levels, and elevated LAP scores. \n   • Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurs in 5% to 20% of cases. \n   Essential thrombocytosis (ET) may also be associated with JAK2, MPL, or CALR mutations. \n   Essential thrombocytosis (ET) is often associated with activating point mutations in JAK2 (50% of cases) or MPL (5% to 10% of cases), a receptor tyrosine kinase that is normally activated by thrombopoietin. \n   In addition, recent DNA sequencing studies have revealed that most of the remaining cases have mutations in calreticulin (CALR), a protein with several functions in the endoplasmic reticulum and the cytoplasm. \n   Since JAK2 and calreticulin mutations are mutually exclusive, it is hypothesized that the calreticulin mutations also increase JAK-STAT signaling through mechanisms that are currently unknown. \n   CML is the consequence of the balanced translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (t[9;22]). \n   PV, PMF, and ET are characterized by driver mutations that directly or indirectly constitutively activate JAK2, a tyrosine kinase essential for the function of the erythropoietin and thrombopoietin receptors and also utilized by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor.",

Hand-Schüller-Christian disease is a multifocal unisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis. It usually affects young children. It is characterized by the triad of: • Diabetes insipidus (excessive thirst) - involvement of the posterior pituitary stalk of the hypothalamus • Exophthalmos • Multiple lytic bone lesions. It usually undergoes spontaneous regression. It is treated with local excision or irradiation. 2. Letterer-Siwe disease is a multifocal multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis. It occurs most frequently before 2 years of age, but occasionally affects adults. • It is characterized by the following features: Cutaneous lesions, resembling a seborrheic eruption - caused by infiltrates of Langerhans cells over the front and back of the trunk and on the scalp. • Hepatosplenomegaly • Lymphadenopathy • Pulmonary lesions • Destructive osteolytic bone lesions • Due to marrow infiltration - anemia, thrombocytopenia, predisposition to recurrent infections (otitis media and mastoiditis). Treatment involves intensive chemotherapy. This condition is fatal if left untreated. 3. Eosinophilic granuloma is a unifocal unisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis. It is characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells admixed with variable numbers of eosinophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils. These lesions occur in the following sites: • Medullary cavities of bones - most commonly the calvarium, ribs, and femur • Skin • Lungs • Stomach. Bone lesions can manifest as: Asymptomatic • Pain • Tenderness • Pathologic fractures. Treatment is by local excision or irradiation. 4. Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis is most often seen in adult smokers. It regresses spontaneously upon cessation of smoking.",
