      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). The biopsyof the thymus showing remnants of Hassall's corpuscles indicates it is due to adenosinedeaminase (ADA) deficiency. SCID is a defect in both humoral and cell-mediated immuneresponses. Usually the defect lies in the T-cell compartment with secondary impairment inhumoral immunity.Affected infants present with prominent thrush (oral candidiasis), extensive diaper rash, andfailure to thrive. Some patients develop a morbilliform rash shortly after birth because maternal Tcells are transferred across the placenta and attack the fetus, causing graft-versus-host disease(GVHD).Persons with SCID are extremely susceptible to recurrent, severe infections by a wide range ofpathogens, including:• Candida albicans•Pneumocystis jiroveci• Pseudomonas• Cytomegalovirus• VaricellaThere are 2 types of SCID based on inheritance:1. X-linked SCID is the most common form and hence it is more common in boys than in girls.The genetic defect is the mutation in the common y-chain (yc) subunit of cytokine receptors. T-cellnumbers are greatly reduced, and although B cells may be normal in number, antibody synthesisis impaired because of the lack of T-cell help. The thymus contains lobules of undifferentiatedepithelial cells resembling fetal thymus.3002. Autosomal recessive is most commonly caused due to deficiency of the enzyme adenosinedeaminase (ADA). The deficiency of ADA leads to the accumulation of deoxyadenosine and itsderivatives (e.g., deoxy-ATP). They are toxic to rapidly dividing immature lymphocytes, especiallythose of the T-cell lineage. Hence, there may be a greater reduction in the number of Tlymphocytes.In the two most common forms (ye mutation and ADA deficiency), the thymus is small and devoidof lymphoid cells. In SCID caused by ADA deficiency, remnants of Hassall's corpuscles can befound.Note: X-linked SCID is the first human disease in which gene therapy has been successful.",

Even though it is an immunodeficiency disease, it isparadoxically associated with autoimmune diseases such as arthritis and dermatomyositis in 35%of individuals.The classic form of this disease has the following characteristics:•⚫ B cells are absent or markedly decreased and the serum levels of all classes of immunoglobulinsare decreased• T-cell mediated reactions are normal•⚫ Germinal centers of lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, the appendix, and tonsils are underdeveloped301•Plasma cells are absent throughout the bodyXLA is characterized by the failure of B-cell precursors (pro-B cells and pre-B cells) to develop intomature B cells. It is associated with mutations in a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase called Brutontyrosine kinase (Btk).The related gene is located on the long arm of the X chromosome. This X-linked disease is seenalmost entirely in males. The disease usually does not become apparent until about 6 months ofage, when maternal immunoglobulins are depleted.Affected individuals are susceptible to infections with:●• Bacteria that are normally opsonized by antibodies and cleared by phagocytosis•Haemophilus influenzae•Streptococcus pneumonia• Staphylococcus aureus• Giardia lamblia - intestinal protozoan that is normally resisted by secreted IgA, causes persistentinfections• Enteroviruses• Echovirus• Poliovirus•Coxsackievirus",

There are normal or elevated levels of IgM, no IgA or IgE,and extremely low levels of IgG. It affects the ability of helper T cells to deliver activating signalsto B cells and macrophages. However, B cells and T cells counts are normal.It is mostly an X-linked disease, that has mutations in the gene encoding CD40L located on Xq26.If the disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, then there are loss-of-function302mutations involving either CD40 or the enzyme called activation-induced cytidine deaminase(AID).Those with CD40L mutations are also susceptible to pneumonia caused by the intracellularorganism Pneumocystis jiroveci. This is due to CD40L-mediated macrophage activation, a keyreaction of cell-mediated immunity being defective. Recurrent pyogenic infection occurs becausethe level of opsonizing IgG antibodies is low.Occasionally, the IgM antibodies react with blood cells, giving rise to autoimmune hemolyticanemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia.

Target cells of HIV include CD4+ helper T cells(worst affected), monocyte-macrophages, and dendritic cells.•The virus core contains:Major capsid protein p24• Nucleocapsid protein p7/p9• Two copies of viral genomic RNA•The three viral enzymes (protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase)The viral core is surrounded by a matrix protein called p17, which lies underneath the virionenvelope. The viral envelope is studded by two viral glycoproteins, gp120 and gp41, which arecritical for HIV infection of cells.Viral glycoprotein gp120 binds to CD4+ cells in the host. CXCR4 and CCR5 function ascoreceptors for HIV-1 entry into CD4+ cells. This binding leads to a conformational change ingp41 causing exposure of a hydrophobic region called the fusion peptide at the tip of gp41. Thispeptide inserts into the cell membrane of the target cells (e.g., T cells or macrophages), leading tothe fusion of the virus with the host cell.The image below shows the pathogenesis of HIV infection.306Pathogenesis of HIVVirusgp120CD4bindingConform-ationalchangegp120,CD4 bindCCR-5gp41membranepenetrationgp41gp120Virus entryCD4 ChemokineReceptorMembranefusionFusion of HIV membranewith host cell membrane;entry of viral genome intocytoplasmCytokineCytokineReceptorHIV RNA genome-Reverse transcriptase mediatedsynthesis of proviral DNAIntegration of provirusinto host cell genome,HIV RNAtranscriptCytokine activationof cell: transcriptionof HIV genome:transport of viral RNAto cytoplasmHIV DNAprovirusVirusreplicationSynthesis of HIV proteins;HIV corestructureassembly of virionscore structureVirusreleaseBudding andrelease ofmature virionNew HIV virionMARROWNucleus",

The vastmajority of primary brain lymphomas are of B-cell origin.At least two mechanisms appear to underlie the increased risk of B-cell tumors in HIV-infectedindividuals. They are:• The unchecked proliferation of B cells infected with oncogenic herpes viruses in the setting ofprofound T-cell depletion (AIDS).•Germinal center B-cell hyperplasia in the setting of early HIV infection.The most common site for lymphoma in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome(AIDS) is the central nervous system (CNS).",
