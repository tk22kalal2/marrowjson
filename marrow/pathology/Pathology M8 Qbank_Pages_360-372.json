The main types of hemoglobin are: Hemoglobin A (HbA), which is the most common form in adults and consists of two alpha chains and two beta chains; Hemoglobin A2 (HbA2), which consists of two alpha chains and two delta chains; and Hemoglobin F (HbF), which consists of two alpha chains and two gamma chains.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "In the given scenario, the corrected reticulocyte count is 3.It is given by the following formula:Corrected reticulocyte count = Reticulocyte count × (patient's hemoglobin or hematocrit/standardhemoglobin or hematocrit)So, in this case, the corrected reticulocyte count = 9×5/15 = 9/3 = 3This formula corrects for hemoglobin. It will show you if the patient is making enoughreticulocytes for the degree of anemia present. As the hemoglobin drops, reticulocytes increasefrom the normal range of 0.5–2.0%.The standard reference range of hemoglobin concentration in females is 12-15 g/dl. Accordingly, inthis scenario, corrected reticulocyte count would range between 3-3.75%. So, the best answer tothis question remains option C.Absolute reticulocyte count is the percentage of red cells that are reticulocytes (normal is about0.5 – 2.0%). However, it does not reflect the fact that as the hemoglobin drops, there should bemore reticulocytes, percentage-wise (for example, at a hemoglobin of 5, you should have a muchhigher percentage of reticulocytes than you should at a hemoglobin of 10). To take this intoaccount, we use corrected reticulocyte count.Reticulocyte Index = Corrected reticulocyte count / maturation factorThis corrects for the longer life span of prematurely released reticulocytes in the blood which is aphenomenon of increased red blood cell production.367HematocritMaturation factor≥ 35%1.035% > Hct >1.525%25% > Hct >2.020%< 20%2.5",

        "C": "↓Cell lysis and activationMARROWInflammation370Solution to Question 10:All three cell lines, RBCs, WBCs, and platelets are affected in paroxysmal nocturnalhemoglobinuria (PNH).PNH occurs from acquired mutations in the gene PIGA which affect GPI-linked proteins.These causative mutations occur in a hematopoietic stem cell. Hence, all of its clonal progeny, i.e.,red cells, white cells, and platelets, are deficient in GPI-linked proteins.Clinical features of PNH include:• Intravascular hemoglobinuria - cola-colored urine• Pancytopenia + hypercellular bone marrow•Thrombosis (if hepatic vein involved → Budd-Chiari syndrome)Solution to Question 11:In PNH, the leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) score is decreased.Alkaline phosphatase activity is found predominantly in mature segmented neutrophils. LAPscore is obtained by assessing the staining intensity in 100 consecutive neutrophils, with eachneutrophil scored on a scale of 1-4. Conditions that result in an increase in leukocytes in all stagesof maturity will reflect a corresponding increase in LAP.Increased LAPLeukemoid reactionPregnancyPolycythemia veraHodgkin'sdiseaseDecreased LAPCMLPNHSickle cell anemiaSolution to Question 12:Among the following, Budd-Chiari Syndrome is the most likely the cause of death in a patient withparoxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).Thrombosis (particularly venous thrombosis) is the leading cause of disease-related death inpatients with PNH. 40% of PNH patients suffer from venous thrombosis, which commonly affectsthe hepatic, portal, or cerebral veins.The pathophysiology of thrombosis in PNH is not completely understood, but two mainmechanisms may be responsible:• Nitric oxide (NO) is absorbed by free hemoglobin (which is released during hemolysis).• Endothelial damage caused by the C5-9 membrane attack complex (due to deficiency of CD59).371Solution to Question 13:The deficiency of GPI linked proteins on blood cells is seen in paroxysmal nocturnalhemoglobinuria (PNH). Cryoglobulinemia is not a complication of this condition.Thrombosis is the leading cause of disease-related death in individuals with paroxysmal nocturnalhemoglobinuria (PNH). About 5% to 10% of patients eventually develop acute myeloidleukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome.Solution to Question 14:The gold standard for the diagnosis of PNH is flow cytometry. It provides a sensitive means fordetecting red cells that are deficient in GPI-linked proteins such as CD59.Investigations in PNH include:•Flow cytometry (gold standar",
