      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) or Lynch syndrome. She should be tested for mutations in MSH genes. It occurs due to defective DNA mismatch repair. It is caused by inherited mutations in genes that encode proteins responsible for the detection, excision, and repair of errors that occur during DNA replication. They include MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 or EPCAM genes. It is the most common syndromic cause of colon cancer. It tends to occur at younger ages than sporadic colon cancers and often involves the right colon. Familial clustering of cancers occurs at several sites, including: colorectum, small bowel, and stomach; endometrium and ovary; ureters; brain; hepatobiliary tract and pancreas; and skin.",
