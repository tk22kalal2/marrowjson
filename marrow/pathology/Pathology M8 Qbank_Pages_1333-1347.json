      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. It is most commonly associated with chromosome 17. It is the most common type of hereditary neuropathy. The most common variant of this condition is CMT1A. It is caused by a duplication of a region on chromosome 17 that includes the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. It usually presents in the first to third decade of life with distal leg weakness, e.g., foot drop with no numbness or tingling. There is reduced sensation to all modalities with reduced muscle stretch reflexes. Atrophy of the muscles below the knee leads to inverted champagne bottle legs. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is characterized by inverted champagne bottle legs, pes cavus (high arch), and hammer toes.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of myasthenia gravis. It is most commonly associated with thymic hyperplasia (65% of cases). Thymoma is seen in around 10% of patients with myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder that is characterized by weakness and the fatigability of skeletal muscles. It is due to the autoantibody-mediated destruction of the acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at the neuromuscular junction. This consequently leads to a decreased transmission at the neuromuscular (myoneural) junction. There is a characteristic pattern of muscle involvement. Lid and extraocular muscles (diplopia and ptosis) are involved early in the disease course. The facial muscles' weakness can produce a snarling expression, weakness in chewing, and a nasal timbre to the voice. Weakness increases with repeated use of the muscles and improves with rest. The reflexes are normal in this condition.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). It is associated with small-cell lung carcinoma. It is an autoimmune disorder caused by antibodies that block acetylcholine release by inhibiting a presynaptic calcium channel. In contrast to myasthenia gravis, rapid, repetitive stimulation (muscle activity) results in an increase in muscle response and strength. Patients typically present with weakness of their extremities. In about half the cases, there is an underlying malignancy; most often, neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung (small cell lung carcinoma). The stimulus for autoantibody formation in paraneoplastic cases may be the expression of the same calcium channel in the neoplastic cells. Patients without cancer often have other autoimmune diseases, such as vitiligo or thyroid disease. Treatment consists of drugs that increase acetylcholine release by depolarizing synaptic membranes (pyridostigmine), plasmapheresis, and immunosuppressive agents, similar to myasthenia gravis.",

The biopsy, along with the history, is suggestive of dermatomyositis. It is associated with perimysial CD4+ cellular infiltrates. Dermatomyositis is an immunologic disease in which damage to small blood vessels contributes to muscle injury. Dermatomyositis biopsy findings include muscle fascicle, perifascicular atrophy, perimysial cellular infiltrates, and endomysium.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given clinical history and the image showing pseudohypertrophy of calf muscles are highly suggestive of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. It is an X-linked recessive condition. Duchenne's and Becker's muscular dystrophy are caused by loss-of-function mutations in the dystrophin gene on the X chromosome. It is one of the largest human genes. Dystrophin provides mechanical stability to the myofiber during muscle contraction. Defects in the complex may lead to small membrane tears that permit the influx of calcium, triggering events that result in myofiber degeneration. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy is associated with deletions or frame-shift mutations that result in the total absence of dystrophin. Immunohistochemical studies for dystrophin show the absence of the normal sarcolemmal staining pattern. In contrast, the mutations in Becker's muscular dystrophy typically permit the synthesis of a truncated version of dystrophin, which retains some function. Immunohistochemical studies for dystrophin show reduced staining.",

Mitochondrial disorders are caused by mutations in the mitochondrial genome. The most consistent pathologic change in skeletal muscle is abnormal aggregates of mitochondria. These are seen preferentially in the subsarcolemmal area of affected myofibers, producing a ragged red fibers appearance.",

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute autoimmune disease that causes fulminant polyradiculoneuropathy. It is a T-cell-mediated immune response. GBS is usually associated with a history of upper respiratory infection (URI) or acute gastroenteritis (AGE) 1-3 weeks prior. The causative organisms may be Campylobacter jejuni, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. It presents with the following features: Ascending motor paralysis (lower limbs > upper limbs), sensory deficits may or may not be seen, deep tendon reflexes - absent, transient bladder dysfunction in severe cases, and autonomic manifestations - loss of vasomotor control, postural hypotension, cardiac dysrhythmias. Histological examination shows inflammation of peripheral nerves, manifested as perivenular and endoneurial infiltration by lymphocytes, macrophages, and a few plasma cells. On electron microscopy, an early effect on myelin sheaths is seen. There is segmental demyelination induced by the actions of activated macrophages.
