      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and histological appearance showing amyloid stroma are suggestive ofmedullary carcinoma of the thyroid. This condition can occur in the setting of MEN2A (Sipplesyndrome) or MEN2B.Medullary Carcinoma of Thyroid1162Medullary Carcinoma of ThyroidAmyloid stromaMedullary carcinomas of the thyroid are neuroendocrine neoplasms derived from theparafollicular cells or C cells of the thyroid. They may be:•Sporadic (70%)• Familial or associated with MEN2 syndromes (30%) -•More aggressive and metastasize more frequently than sporadic•Usually bilateral and multicentricBoth forms can be associated with RET mutations.These tumors may present with:•Mass in the neck• Dysphagia.⚫ Hoarseness• Diarrhea due to the secretion of VIP• Cushing's syndrome due to ACTH secretionHistopathology shows polygonal to spindle-shaped cells, which may form nests, trabeculae, andeven follicles. Acellular amyloid deposits derived from calcitonin polypeptides are present in thestroma. These lesions secrete calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen.1163",
