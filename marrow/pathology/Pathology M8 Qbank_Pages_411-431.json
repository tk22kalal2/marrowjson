It links theexposed collagen to platelets. It facilitates platelet to platelet interaction and also stabilizes thehemostatic plug against shear forces.It is a carrier protein for factor VIII and also protects it from proteolytic degradationand stabilizes it. The half-life of factor VIII is about 2.4 hours when free and 12 hours when boundto vWF in the circulation.Since vWF stabilizes factor VIII, a deficiency of vWF gives rise to a secondary decrease in factorVIII levels.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is not associated with deficiency of CD59.It is associated with deficiency of the following components:•Complement factor H• Membrane cofactor protein (CD46)• Complement factor IThese three proteins prevent excessive activation of the alternative complement pathway.Deficiencies of these proteins can be caused by inherited defects or acquired inhibitoryautoantibodies. The disease may be associated with a remitting, relapsing course.",

        "A": "Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura",
        "B": "Hemolytic uremic syndrome",

        "D": "Disseminated intravascular coagulation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Coombs test is positive in immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) as it is an immunogenic cause of thrombocytopenia. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are non-immunogenic causes. Hence, Coombs test is negative in these conditions. Coomb's test detects RBCs from a patient with hemolytic anemia containing surface antibodies. Coomb's reagent (anti-human antibodies) is added. Direct Coomb's test: recipient's serum containing antibodies (Immunoglobulins). Reagent containing washed RBCs is added. Coomb's reagent binds to autoantibodies on RBCs and causes agglutination. Recipient Immunoglobulins get attached to the surface of these RBCs. Coomb's reagent (anti-human antibodies) are added. Indirect Coomb's test: agglutination occurs due to the presence of antibodies.",

        "C": "Clotting factors",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Weber-Osler-Rendu syndrome is a disorder of the blood vessels. It is an autosomal-dominant disorder caused by mutations that modulate TGF-β signalling. It is also known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. This condition is characterized by dilated, tortuous blood vessels with thin walls that bleed readily. Bleeding is most common in the mucous membranes of the nose (epistaxis), tongue, mouth, and eyes, and throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) are normal. Clinical conditions in which abnormalities of vessel wall cause bleeding include: • Infections - meningococcemia, infective endocarditis, rickettsioses • Collagen defects - Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, scurvy, and Cushing's syndrome • Perivascular amyloidosis - most common with amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis • Henoch-Schönlein purpura • Drug reactions",
