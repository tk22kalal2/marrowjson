Therefore, it is often referred to as cor pulmonale. It is caused by disorders ofthe lung parenchyma and pulmonary vasculature. It is also caused by conditions causingpulmonary vasoconstriction like obstructive sleep apnea and altitude sickness.Pulmonary hypertension is the common feature of these disorders, which leads to hypertrophyand dilation of the right side of the heart.Right-sided heart failure is most commonly caused by left-sided heart failure.

      "explanation": "In the image, the liver specimen shows a nutmeg liver appearance, which occurs in congestivehepatomegaly. This is secondary to passive congestion due to right heart failure.In right heart failure, there is congestion of hepatic and portal vessels, greatest around the centralveins. This leads to increased liver size and weight. The pericentral zones become congested andred-brown. The periportal regions are normal coloured and tan. This leads to a nutmeg liverappearance. With longstanding failure, the central areas can become fibrotic, eventuallyculminating in cardiac cirrhosis.Pathological changes are also seen in the spleen and the gastrointestinal tract. Portal venoushypertension also causes the enlargement of the spleen, with platelet sequestration. This is knownas congestive splenomegaly. This can also contribute to chronic congestion and oedema of thebowel.704",

However, ifthe infarct preceded death by 2 to 3 hours, it is possible to identify the area of necrosis. This isdone by immersing the tissue slices in triphenyl tetrazolium chloride solution.The histochemical stain imparts a brick-red colour to intact, noninfarcted myocardium.Here, lactate dehydrogenase, LDH, activity is preserved. LDH leaks out through the damagedmembranes of dead cells, so an infarct appears as an unstained pale zone.The image given below shows an ischemic brain after immersion in triphenyl tetrazolium chloridesolution.

Troponins are highlyspecific for MI and remain elevated for 7 to 10 days.710Troponins are proteins that regulate calcium-mediated contraction of the cardiac and skeletalmuscles. It is the single biomarker preferred for diagnosing MI, late diagnosis of MI, anddiagnosis of reinfarction. Troponin I is more important than troponin T.Cardiac troponin increases rapidly in patients with reinfarction. Sometimes, the cardiac troponinconcentration is elevated, but stable or decreasing at the time of suspected reinfarction. Thenthe diagnosis of reinfarction requires a 20% or greater increase in the cTn measurement.Myoglobin is the earliest enzyme to increase after MI. It is a protein that is found in the skeletaland cardiac muscles, which binds oxygen. It is a very sensitive indicator of muscle injury. But it isnot specific to cardiac muscle and can be elevated to any form of injury to skeletal muscle.Myoglobin and SGOT levels come to baseline before day 1.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Loss of function mutation in K+ channel genes KCNQ1 and KCNH2 produces the long QTsyndrome. The gain-of-function mutation produces the short QT syndrome.Long QT syndrome manifests as arrhythmias associated with excessive prolongation of cardiacrepolarization. Stress-induced syncope or sudden cardiac death (SCD), are common presentations.Short QT syndrome presents with arrhythmias associated with abbreviated repolarizationintervals. They also present with palpitations, syncope, and SCD.711Brugada syndrome manifests as ECG abnormalities like ST-segment elevations and rightbundle-branch block. This occurs in the absence of structural heart disease. Here, patientsclassically present with syncope or SCD during rest or sleep or after large meals.Familial atrial fibrillation is caused by a gain of function mutation in genes coding potassiumchannels.",

      "explanation": "The mechanism behind sudden cardiac death (SCD) is most often a lethal arrhythmia, e.g.,asystole or ventricular fibrillation.Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of SCD, responsible for 80% to 90% of cases. But, themechanism of SCD is most often a lethal arrhythmia. Infarction need not occur. Most of thepatients who have SCD but are successfully resuscitated do not show any enzymatic or ECGevidence of myocardial necrosis.Ischemic injury can directly affect the major components of the conduction system. But, mostcases of fatal arrhythmia are triggered by electrical irritability of the myocardium.",

They occurin irreversibly injured myocytes with damaged membranes, when blood supply is restored 12-24hours after MI.During ischemia, the intracellular levels of calcium are increased due to impaired calcium cyclingand sarcolemmal damage. This leads to augmented and uncontrolled contraction of myofibrils712after reperfusion.On microscopic examination, the irreversibly injured myocytes exhibit contraction bands that areintensely eosinophilic intracellular stripes. These contraction bands are composed of closelypacked sarcomeres.Reperfused infarcts are usually hemorrhagic because the vasculature is injured during ischemia.This leads to bleeding after the flow is restored.713",
