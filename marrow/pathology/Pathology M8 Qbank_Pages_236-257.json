      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Cyclophosphamide is a directly-acting carcinogen that does not require metabolic activation.Carcinogens can be direct-acting or indirect-acting based on their activation.Direct-acting carcinogens require no metabolic conversion to become carcinogenic. Most are weakcarcinogens, but some are important because they are cancer chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g.,245alkylating agents). The direct-acting carcinogens include:• Alkylating Agents:• ° -Propiolactone• Dimethyl sulfate• Diepoxybutane• Anticancer drugs (cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, nitrosoureas, and others)•Acylating Agents:• 1-Acetyl-imidazole• Dimethylcarbamyl chlorideIndirect-acting carcinogens (procarcinogens) are chemicals that require metabolic conversion tobecome active carcinogens. The carcinogenic product of metabolism is called an ultimatecarcinogen. The indirect-acting carcinogens include:•••Polycyclic and heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons:Benz[a]anthraceneBenzo[a]pyrene• Dibenz[a,h]anthracene• 3-Methylcholanthrene• 7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene•• Aromatic amines, amides, azo dyes:• 2-Naphthylamine (°-naphthylamine)• Benzidine• 2-Acetylaminofluorene•Dimethylaminoazobenzene (butter yellow)• Natural plant and microbial products:• Aflatoxin B1• Griseofulvin•Cycasin• Safrole• Betel nuts• Others• Nitrosamine and amides•Vinyl chloride, nickel, chromium• Insecticides, fungicides• Polychlorinated biphenyls246",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "UVB (ultraviolet B) causes cutaneous cancers due to the formation of pyrimidine dimers in DNA.When DNA absorbs energy from UVB, there is a covalent crosslinking of pyrimidine bases anddistortion of the DNA helix. This prevents proper pairing of the dimer with bases in the oppositeDNA strand.Normally, these defects are repaired by nucleotide excision repair pathway. Defects in nucleotideexcision repair pathway result in xeroderma pigmentosum.UV portion of the solar spectrum is divided into three wavelength ranges:Note: UVC is the most potent mutagen but is not considered significant as it is filtered out by theozone layer.SpectrumUVAWavelength320-40onmUVB280-32onmUVC200-28onm",

EBV genometriggers B-cell signaling pathways inducing B-cell growth and transformation.The infection of B cells is latent as there is no viral replication and the cells are notkilled. However, B cells latently infected with EBV express viral proteins that result in the abilityto propagate indefinitely in vitro.

      "explanation": "The serum levels of catecholamines are elevated in malignant pheochromocytoma. Extra-adrenallocation is the only criteria for malignancy in pheochromocytoma.Pheochromocytoma is a rare catecholamine-secreting tumor that may precipitate life-threateninghypertension. It is classically associated with three syndromes:• von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome•Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2)• Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)Catecholamines produced by pheochromocytomas are metabolized within chromaffin cells.Norepinephrine is metabolized to normetanephrine, and epinephrine is metabolized tometanephrine. Because this process occurs within the tumor, independent of catecholaminerelease, pheochromocytomas are best diagnosed by the measurement of these metabolites, ratherthan by measurement of the parent catecholamines.254",

        "C": "PDGFRA",
        "D": "NRG-1Correct Option"
      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "NRG-1 (Neuregulin-1) is not a marker for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).GIST are the most common mesenchymal tumor of the abdomen, the stomach being the mostcommon site. They arise from the interstitial cells of Cajal, the pacemaker cells of the GIT. GIST isseen in the 5th to 6th decade of life and has an equal preponderance among males and females.Most patients present with haematemesis, melena, or vague abdominal pain. The most commonindications for surgery include bleeding and obstruction.The GIST may occur in a sporadic form or as part of familial syndromes. In sporadic GIST, themost common mutations seen are gain-of-function mutation in KIT (75-80%) and PDGFRAmutation (8%). Microscopically, GIST has elongated spindle cells or plumper epithelioid cells, or amixed pattern.The below image shows the microscopy of GIST composed of bundles, or fascicles, ofspindle-shaped tumor cells.GIST - HistopathologySpindle cellsEpithelioid cells256Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient GIST is a subset of wild-type GIST seen with Carneytriad or Carney-Stratakis syndrome.Imatinib can be used to treat GIST with mutations in KIT or PDGFRA. Succinate dehydrogenase(SDH) deficient GIST is imatinib-resistant, so sunitinib, sorafenib, or regorafenib can be usedinstead.-During surgical resection of GIST, care must be taken to prevent capsule rupture, which causesseeding of nearby tissues leading to relapse in 100% of the cases. If capsule rupture occurs,adjuvant therapy with imatinib is indicated regardless of tumor extent.Other options:Option A: KIT (CD117): This is the most well-known marker for GISTs. About 85% of GISTs showmutations in the KIT gene, leading to the expression of the KIT protein on the cell surface. KIT isa receptor tyrosine kinase, and its activation is a key driver in the pathogenesis of GISTs.Option B: SDH (Succinate Dehydrogenase): SDH mutations are associated with a subset of GISTs,particularly those that are KIT and PDGFRA wild-type. Loss of SDH function is characteristic ofthis subgroup, and SDH deficiency can be demonstrated through immunohistochemistry.Option C: PDGFRA (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha): Mutations in the PDGFRAgene account for approximately 5-10% of GISTs. Similar to KIT, PDGFRA is a receptor tyrosinekinase, and mutations in this gene can lead to the development of GISTs.257",
