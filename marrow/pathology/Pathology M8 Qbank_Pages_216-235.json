      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given scenario and fundus examination are suggestive of uveal melanoma, which is associated with a point mutation of the GNAQ protein or GNA11 genes. Uveal melanomas (UM) originate from melanocytes in the interior wall of the eye, including the iris, ciliary body, and the choroid, with marked differences in light exposure (from dark anterior to illuminated posterior). GNAS mutation causes pituitary adenoma and other endocrine tumors. The three RAS genes in humans (H-RAS, K-RAS, and N-RAS) are the most common oncogenes in human cancer. They code for a family of proteins called GTP-binding (G) proteins, which are involved in transmitting signals within cells (cellular signal transduction). When RAS is 'switched on' by incoming signals, it subsequently switches on other proteins, which ultimately results in cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Mutations in RAS genes can lead to the production of permanently activated RAS proteins. As a result, this can cause unintended and overactive signaling inside the cell, even in the absence of incoming signals. Because these signals result in cell growth and division, overactive RAS signaling can ultimately lead to cancer.",

        "D": "In familial cases, children inherit one defective copy of the RB gene and the other copy is normal"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Retinoblastoma is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Knudson's hypothesis, also known as the two-hit hypothesis or multiple-hit hypothesis, states that cancer is the result of accumulated mutations in a cell's DNA. Two mutations (hits), involving both alleles of RB at chromosome locus 13q14, are required to produce retinoblastoma. In familial cases, children inherit one defective copy of the RB gene in the germline (the first hit), and the other copy is normal. Retinoblastoma develops when the normal RB allele is mutated in retinoblasts as a result of a spontaneous somatic mutation (the second hit). Most individuals inheriting a germline defect in one RB allele develop unilateral or bilateral retinoblastoma as it is an autosomal dominant disease. Sporadic cases are comparatively rare. In sporadic cases, both normal RB alleles must undergo somatic mutation in the same retinoblast (two hits).",

        "D": "The cell cycle progresses and cell divides"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "If the retinoblastoma (RB) gene is hypophosphorylated, it is active and the cell cycle will stop at G1. RB is a cell-cycle regulator because it binds to and inactivates a transcription factor (E2F). This is necessary for the transcription of certain genes necessary for the progression from the G1 to S phase. The phosphorylation of RB results in the release of E2F. This activates gene transcription and cell-cycle progression occurs. The image given below shows the cell cycle regulation by RB gene. Rb Regulation of the Cell E2F. Rb. Cell growth. Rb. More ATP ADP. Unphosphorylated Rb binds transcription factor E2F. E2F cannot bind the DNA, and transcription is blocked. Cell growth triggers the phosphorylation of Rb. Phosphorylated Rb releases E2F, which binds the DNA and turns on gene expression, thus advancing the cell cycle.",

        "D": "p53 can be inactivated by E6 protein of HPV"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "P53 is the tumor suppressor gene and activation (not inactivation) causes cell cycle arrest at the G1-S and G2-M phase of the cell cycle. P53 regulates: cell cycle progression, DNA repair, cellular senescence, and apoptosis. It is activated by anoxia, inappropriate signaling by mutated oncoproteins, and DNA damage. It is the most frequently mutated gene in cancers. It upregulates the expression of proteins such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, thereby causing cell-cycle arrest at the G1-S. It also transactivates and transrepresses target genes to induce G2/M arrest. Mutation in the p53 gene causes resistance in tumors to radiation and chemotherapy. The E6 protein of human papillomavirus (HPV) binds to and helps in the degradation of p53 and stimulates the expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), which is the catalytic subunit of telomerase, thereby helping in the longevity of the cells. E6 from high-risk HPV types has a higher affinity for p53 than E6 from low-risk types. Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder due to a defect in the tumor suppressor gene P53 located on chromosome 17.",

      "explanation": "Fanconi syndrome is not associated with defective homologous recombination DNA repair mechanism. It is a rare disorder of kidney tubule function. Diseases with defects in DNA repair by homologous recombination: • Bloom syndrome and ataxia-telangiectasia are triggered by DNA-damaging agents such as ionizing radiation. Fanconi anemia is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in multiple genes responsible for coding for proteins that participate in DNA repair pathways and are triggered by DNA-crosslinking agents like chemotherapeutic drugs. • Familial breast cancer is due to inherited gene defects in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.",

It is characterized by the translocation and deregulation of the c-mycgene on chromosome 8.The classic t(8;14)(q24;q32) reciprocal translocation results in the transposition of the c-mycproto-oncogene on chromosome 8 with one of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) genes onchromosome 14. This results in activation of the c-myc gene and is considered responsible fortumor proliferation.Chromosome Translocation in Burkitt's Lymphoma;Tumor Cells are B-lymphocytesShort ArmChromosomeLong ArmChromosome9--Break PointsNormalChromosome 8NormalChromosome 14TranslocationChromosome 8q-TranslocationChromosome 14q+",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab was the first drug to achieve a significant improvement insurvival of advanced-stage melanoma. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) plays animportant inhibitory role in the control of T-cell activation.Ipilimumab is a fully-humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that inhibits cytotoxic T lymphocyteantigen-4 (CTLA-4).It has been postulated that anti-CTLA-4 antibodies act by blocking inhibitory signals from effectorT-cells, allowing costimulatory signaling and generation of antitumor T-cell responses. In vitrostudies demonstrated also that the antitumor activity of CTLA-4 blockade is mediated by Fcgamma receptor-expressing macrophage and hypothesized a possible role of regulatory T-celldepletion in the tumor microenvironment.Option B - Mutation of tumor supressor genes is associated with increased risk of cancer. Antigentoxicity is when the immune response to an antigen is excessive or misdirected, causing damage totissues or organs.Option CPD1/PDL1 is an immune checkpoint whose activation inhibits T-cell function and helpswith immune tolerance. Blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interaction using immune checkpoint inhibitorsreactivates T cells and enhances immune responses against tumors.Option D-CD28 is primarily involved in providing the second signal required for T cellactivation. The first signal comes from the interaction between the T cell receptor (TCR) and theantigen presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on antigen-presenting cells(APCs). Without CD28-mediated costimulation, T cells that only receive the TCR signal (withoutthe second signal) can become anergic.235",
