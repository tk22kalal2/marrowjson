      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AML is a tumor of hematopoietic progenitors caused by acquired oncogenic mutations that impede differentiation, leading to the accumulation of immature myeloid blasts in the marrow. It occurs at all ages, but the incidence rises throughout life, peaking after 60 years of age. The peripheral smear shows blasts with abundant cytoplasm, fine azurophilic granules, Auer rods, and delicate nuclear chromatin with 1-4 prominent nucleoli. The blasts are positive for CD33. Occasionally, blasts are entirely absent from the blood (aleukemic leukemia). Bone marrow examination is essential to exclude acute leukemia in pancytopenic patients.",

Option A: Auer rods are distinctive needle-like azurophilic granules present in many cases, but particularly numerous in AML with the t(15;17) aberration (acute promyelocytic leukemia). Option B: The term flaming promyelocyte refers to cells that appear to be breaking apart, taking on a vibrant reddish-purple hue with the apparent liberation of granules into the surrounding cellular matrix.

Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is located in the primary granules of neutrophils and their precursors, in eosinophil granules, and in the azurophilic granules of monocytes. The most primitive myeloblasts are negative, with granular positivity appearing progressively as they mature toward the promyelocyte stage. Promyelocytes and myelocytes are the most strongly staining cells in the granulocyte series. Monoblasts and monocytes may be negative or positive. AML-M4 shows both myelocytic and monocytic differentiation. Hence, it shows both MPO and non-specific esterase (marker for monocytes) positivity.",

Signs and symptoms related to the involvement of tissues other than the marrow are usually less striking in AML than in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). But tumors with monocytic differentiation (AML M4, M5) often infiltrate the skin (leukemia cutis) and the gingiva.

Frequent sites of involvement are: skin, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, bone, soft tissue, testis, and peritoneum.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is associated with a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17, producing a PML-RARA fusion gene. This fusion gene encodes for a chimeric protein, which consists of a part of the PML protein and a part of the retinoic acid receptor-α (RARα). The normal RARα binds to DNA and activates transcription in the presence of retinoids. However, the chimeric protein produced by PML-RARA has reduced affinity for retinoids. This causes inhibition of transcription, thereby preventing gene expression for cellular differentiation. This leads to the accumulation of myeloid progenitor cells. The condition is treated with all-trans retinoic acid, which binds to the PML-RARA chimeric protein, causing a conformational change such that the protein regains its normal function and activates DNA transcription.",
