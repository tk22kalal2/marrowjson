      "explanation": "Anaemia is the most common hematologic abnormality associated with HIV infection. It affects60-80% of patients during the late stage.In most cases, the cause of anaemia in HIV-infected patients is multifactorial. It is oftenassociated with infection, inflammation, malignancy, malnutrition, and polypharmacy.332Note: Prior to the use of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART), thrombocytopenia was a commonfinding in individuals infected with HIV. With use of potent ART, the incidence ofthrombocytopenia is far lower.",

      "explanation": "Hepcidin inhibits iron transfer from the enterocytes into the plasma by binding to ferroportin,which is an iron efflux channel in the enterocyte.Iron metabolism is regulated by hepcidin, a protein and acute phase reactant produced by theliver. It binds to ferroportin and degrades it. This inhibits the transfer of iron from the enterocyteto the plasma via ferroportin. As a result, iron becomes trapped within the duodenal cells(enterocytes) in the form of mucosal ferritin and is lost in feces when these cells are shed off.Transcription of hepcidin is increased by the following factors:• Increased levels of iron• Inflammatory cytokinesTranscription of hepcidin is decreased by the following factors:• Iron deficiency.Hypoxia• Ineffective erythropoiesisHepcidin is encoded by the HAMP gene and its mutations are associated with hereditaryhemochromatosis.335Iron absorptionHepcidinHeme ironHemetransporterFe2+Ferroportin 1LiverDMT-1Fe2+FoodFe2+Fe²+HephaestinFe3+Duodenalcytochrome BNonhemeironLost by sheddingof epithelial cellsOMARROWFe3+PlasmatransferrinBloodErythroid",

        "D": "Ferritin mRNA concentration iron responsive element decreases and ferritin synthesisincreases"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In iron deficiency anaemia, there is an increase in transferrin receptor mRNA concentration andsynthesis.Iron absorbed through diet or which is released from circulation is bound to transferrin (irontransfer protein). When erythropoiesis is stimulated, iron-transferrin complexes act as transferrinreceptors on the surface of bone marrow erythroid cells. Through receptor-mediated endocytosis,this complex is internalised.This iron is then made available for heme synthesis while the transferrin-receptor complex isrecycled to the surface of the cell, from where the transferrin is released back into circulation andthe transferrin receptor re-anchors into the cell membrane. The excess iron after hemoglobinsynthesis binds to apoferritin (storage protein), forming ferritin.Senescent RBCs undergo phagocytosis in the cells of the reticuloendothelial system. Thehemoglobin is broken down, the globin and other proteins are returned to the amino acid pool,and the iron is shuttled back to the surface of the reticuloendothelial cell, where it is taken up bytransferrin via ferroportin (iron export channel).There is no regulated excretory pathway for iron, and the only mechanisms by which iron is lostare blood loss (via gastrointestinal bleeding, menstruation, or other forms of bleeding) and theloss of epithelial cells from the skin, gut, and genitourinary tract. The normal daily iron loss fromthe body is 1-2 mg.336VariablesIron-deficient stateIron-excess state↓Iron uptake↑Transferrin receptor synthesi↑↓STransferrin receptor mRNA c↑↓oncentrationIron storage↓↑Ferritin synthesis↓↑Ferritin mRNA concentrationNo changeNo change",
