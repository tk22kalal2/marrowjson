      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of celiac disease or gluten-sensitive enteropathy. It is associatedwith HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 alleles.It is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing foods suchas barley, rye, oats, and wheat (mnemonic: BROW) in genetically predisposed individuals.In these individuals, digestion of the gluten-containing diet leads to the formation of gliadinpeptides. These peptides result in the following immune reactions:•They can activate the epithelial cells to express certain cytokines (IL-15), which result in CD8+ Tcell proliferation• They undergo deamidation and interact with HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 on the antigen-presentingcells. This leads to CD4+ T cell stimulation and further cytokine productionThese mechanisms result in epithelial tissue damage.Antibodies associated with celiac disease are:•.Anti-gliadin antibodies• Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (anti-ttG)• Anti-endomysial antibodies.Microscopic findings include:.• Villi atrophy and flattening••Crypt hyperplasia• Increased intraepithelial T cells",

      "explanation": "In cystic fibrosis, malabsorption occurs due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, not intestinalmucosal defects.Cystic fibrosis is caused by pathogenic mutations in the CFTR gene on chromosome 7 thatencodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein.The absence of CFTR protein interferes with Na+, HCO3-, and water secretion resulting indefective luminal hydration. This causes the formation of pancreatic intraductal concretions andcauses exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.",
