      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The following features are required for the diagnosis of pituitary carcinoma: • A pituitary tumor that has metastasized to distant sites, either craniospinal or systemic sites (and/or) • Presence of a pituitary tumor that is not contiguous with the primary sellar tumor. Pituitary carcinoma is extremely rare (< 1% of total tumors). They are associated with activating mutations of the HRAS oncogene. The diagnosis of pituitary carcinoma cannot be made based on histologic appearance alone. Though pituitary adenomas normally show cellular monomorphism and the absence of a reticulin network, they can have some overlapping features with malignant tumors, such as: • Atypical adenomas - show pleomorphism and atypical mitosis • Invasive adenomas - are non-encapsulated, show local invasion into cavernous and sphenoid sinuses, dura, brain. However, they remain confined to the primary tumor site.",

      "explanation": "The most common cause of asymptomatic hypercalcemia (isolated hypercalcemia without signs orsymptoms) is primary hyperparathyroidism. It is also the most common cause of hypercalcemiaoverall.Primary hyperparathyroidism results in autonomous overproduction of parathyroid hormone(PTH), resulting in elevated levels. It usually results from an adenoma or hyperplasia ofparathyroid tissue.The most common cause of symptomatic hypercalcemia is malignancy. The most commonmechanism through which osteolytic tumors induce hypercalcemia is the secretion of thePTH-related peptide (PTHrP).",

      "explanation": "The given clinical picture is highly suggestive of primary hyperparathyroidism. The most commoncause is a sporadic, solitary parathyroid adenoma.Parathyroid tumors may be associated with cyclin D1 gene inversions and MEN1mutations. Hyperparathyroidism refers to elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH). It is classifiedinto:-• Primary autonomous overproduction of PTH• Secondary compensatory hypersecretion of PTH in response to prolonged hypocalcemia-• Tertiary - persistent hypersecretion of PTH even after correction of prolonged hypocalcemia.(e.g. after renal transplant)1133The classical symptoms and signs of primary hyperparathyroidism are due to hypercalcemia aswell as increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. The features of hypercalcemia are as follows:The features of elevated PTH levels are as follows:⚫ Osteitis fibrosa cystica••.•Osteopenia/osteoporosis• Hyperuricemia and gout⚫ Pseudogout• Increased production of calcitriol• Nephrolithiasis•Hypophosphatemia• AnemiaThe clinical signs associated with primary hyperparathyroidism can be remembered with themnemonic \"bones, stones, groans, moans with fatigue overtones\"SystemMusculoskeletalRenalGITNeuropsychiatricCardiacEctopic calcificationClinical featuresBone painSkeletal deformitiesPathological fracturesMyalgia and arthralgiaRenal stones(Calcium oxalate> calcium phosphate)Nephrocalcinosis Polyuria and dehydrationRenal failureConstipationNausea, vomiting, anorexiaAbdominal painPeptic ulcer diseaseAcute pancreatitisAnxiety, depressionCognitivedysfunctionIrritabilityHallucinationsShort QT intervalBradycardiaHypertensionCornea: Band keratopathyExtravascular tissues: calcinosisSmall arteries: calciphylaxis",

The bonefinding associated with this condition is osteitis fibrosa cystica.This condition is also called brown tumor or von Recklinghausen disease of bone.1134In hyperparathyroidism, high levels of PTH result in increased osteoclast activity. This results inbone loss which predisposes to microfractures and secondary hemorrhages. This results in thefollowing changes:•• An influx of macrophages that form giant cells•Mass of reparative fibrous tissue• Increased vascularity, hemorrhage, and hemosiderin deposition - results in brown colorThe image given below is showing a brown tumor with numerous giant cells with interstitialhemorrhage, hemosiderin.Option A: Osteoporosis circumscripta is a large, well-defined lytic lesion seen in the skull ofpatients with Paget's disease.Option B: Fraying and cupping of the metaphysis of the bones are classically seen in patientssuffering from rickets.Option D: Punched out lytic lesions of the bone are seen in patients with multiple myeloma.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "This clinical scenario is suggestive of hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinemia. As C-peptide is amarker of endogenous insulin secretion, its levels would help in identifying the source of insulin:• High C-peptide- excess insulin production (insulinoma)•Normal/low C-peptide - exogenous insulin administration (factitious disorder)The precursor molecule of insulin is pre-proinsulin, which gets cleaved to form proinsulin. Thisproinsulin gets cleaved to form insulin and C-peptide (by-product). Hence, both are secreted inequimolar quantities during insulin secretion. Hence, the level of C-peptide corresponds to thelevel of endogenous insulin.The levels of C-peptide decrease with the loss of °-cell mass in type 1 diabetes.1135",

They bind to a specific receptor (RAGE) that isexpressed on inflammatory cells (macrophages and T cells), endothelium, and vascular smoothmuscle.The detrimental effects of the AGE-RAGE signalling axis within the vascular compartmentinclude:• Release of cytokines and growth factors, including TGF-° - leads to deposition of excessbasement membrane material•Generation of reactive oxygen species in endothelial cells.• Increased procoagulant activity on endothelial cells and macrophages..• Enhanced proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and synthesis of extracellular matrixThese effects are responsible for the microvascular and macrovascular complications in diabetesmellitus.",
