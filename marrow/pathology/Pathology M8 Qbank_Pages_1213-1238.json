      "explanation": "Osteochondroma, also known as exostosis, is the most common benign bone tumor. It is a benign cartilage-capped tumor. 85% of osteochondromas are solitary. The remainder is seen as part of the multiple hereditary exostosis syndromes, an autosomal-dominant hereditary disease. Lesions arise from the metaphysis near the growth plate of long tubular bones, especially near the knee. They are either sessile or pedunculated and range in size from 1 to 20 cm. Histologically, the cap is composed of benign hyaline cartilage varying in thickness and is covered peripherally by perichondrium. Osteochondromas can progress to chondrosarcoma.

The type II variant of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is uniformly fatal in utero or during the perinatal period. Type II OI is characterized by extraordinary bone fragility with multiple intrauterine fractures. Osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease) is caused by deficiencies in the synthesis of type I collagen. It can be separated into four major clinical subtypes that vary widely in severity. The severity of the disease is based on the location of the mutation within the protein. Individuals with type I OI have a normal life span, but experience childhood fractures that decrease in frequency following puberty.",

      "explanation": "This given clinical scenario is suggestive of achondroplasia. Achondroplasia is the most common skeletal dysplasia and a major cause of dwarfism. It has autosomal dominant inheritance. It occurs due to the gain of a mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR3). This leads to abnormal cartilage proliferation at growth plates and affects endochondral bone growth.

        "D": "Phosphorylase"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of osteopetrosis. It occurs due to autosomal recessive defects in the gene for the enzyme carbonic anhydrase II. Carbonic anhydrase II is required by osteoclasts and renal tubular cells to generate protons from carbon dioxide and water (acidification). The absence of carbonic anhydrase II prevents osteoclasts from acidifying the resorption pit and dissolution of calcium hydroxyapatite within the bone matrix. It also blocks the acidification of urine by the renal tubular cells. This leads to reduced bone resorption and diffuse symmetric skeletal sclerosis. Due to deficient osteoclast activity, bones involved by osteopetrosis lack a medullary canal, giving it a bone-in-bone appearance. The ends of long bones are bulbous (Erlenmeyer flask deformity) and misshapen. The neural foramina are small and compress the exiting nerves, leading to cranial nerve palsies. Extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis leads to leukopenia and prominent hepatosplenomegaly. As carbonic anhydrase II is widely expressed, mutations of this gene result in a condition called marble brain disease or Guibaud-Vainsel syndrome.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of osteoporosis. Cytokines stimulate osteoclast recruitment and activity in osteoporosis by increasing the levels of RANKL. RANKL helps in diminishing the expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG), increasing osteoclast proliferation, and preventing osteoclast apoptosis. Decreased estrogen levels after menopause actually increase both bone resorption and formation. However, the latter does not keep up with the former, leading to a high turnover. Decreased estrogen appears to increase the secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1.",

        "D": "Sarcoma occurs in less than 1% of all individuals"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Paget disease is monostotic in about 70-80% of cases and polyostotic in the rest of them. Paget disease (osteitis deformans) is a disorder of increased, but disordered and structurally unsound, bone mass. The onset is in late adulthood (average age at diagnosis, 70 years). It occurs due to mutations in the SQSTM1 gene. This increases the activity of NF-κB, which then increases osteoclast activity. Three sequential phases exist: Initial osteolytic stage, Mixed osteoclastic-osteoblastic stage, and Final burned-out quiescent osteosclerotic stage. The axial skeleton or proximal femur is involved in up to 80% of the cases. The typical x-ray findings are as follows: Enlargement of the craniofacial skeleton: leontiasis ossea or lion face, Invagination of the skull base (platybasia), and Chalk stick-type fractures in the long bones of the lower extremities. The pathological hallmark is a mosaic pattern of lamellar bone, seen in the sclerotic phase, which shows a jigsaw-like pattern produced by unusually prominent cement lines, which join haphazardly oriented units of lamellar bone. Laboratory findings show elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline (normal serum calcium and phosphorus). Following tumors can develop in the affected bones in Paget's disease: Benign tumors - Giant cell tumors, Giant cell reparative granuloma, Extra-osseous masses of hematopoietic tissue, and Sarcoma (osteosarcoma or fibrosarcoma) - most dreaded complication. Occurs in < 1% of all individuals with Paget disease, and in 5% to 10% of those with the severe polyostotic disease.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Osteopetrosis does not belong to the clinical spectrum of hyperparathyroidism. The features of hyperparathyroidism are as follows: Osteitis fibrosa cystica, osteopenia/osteoporosis, hyperuricemia and gout, pseudogout, increased production of calcitriol, dissecting osteitis and brown tumors, nephrolithiasis, hypophosphatemia, and anemia. Hyperparathyroidism leads to significant skeletal changes related to unabated osteoclast activity. Increased osteoclast activity is most prominent in cortical bone, but the medullary bone is not spared. Osteoclasts may tunnel into and dissect centrally along the length of the trabeculae, creating the appearance of railroad tracks, diagnostic of dissecting osteitis. Generalized osteoporosis may be seen in the phalanges, vertebrae, and proximal femur. Brown tumor presents with bone loss leading to microfractures and secondary hemorrhages, which causes an influx of macrophages and ingrowth of reparative fibrous tissue. Generalized osteitis presents with increased bone cell activity, peri-trabecular fibrosis, and cystic brown tumors.",

      "explanation": "Osteochondromas, multiple enchondromas, and synovial chondromatosis can progress to becomechondrosarcoma.The average age of patients with secondary chondrosarcoma is 35 years (less than that of thosewith primary tumors). These tumors most commonly affect the pelvic bones. The increasedthickness of the cartilage cap (normally 1–3 mm) is considered an indicator of potentialmalignancy.Multiple enchondromas in the setting of Ollier's disease or Maffucci's syndrome carry asignificantly higher risk of transformation to secondary chondrosarcoma than solitaryenchondromas. Histological findings of abundant myxoid change, cyst formation, and permeationof existing trabeculae suggest malignancy.Secondary malignancy in synovial chondromatosis has been reported, but it is rare.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of osteoclastoma/ giant-cell tumor (GCT) of bone.GCT is a relatively uncommon benign, but locally aggressive, neoplasm that usually arises inindividuals in their 20s to 40s. The neoplastic cells express high levels of RANKL. It promotes theproliferation of osteoclast precursors and their differentiation into mature osteoclasts via RANKexpressed by these cells.1236GCTs arise in the epiphysis but may extend into the metaphysis. The majority arise around theknee (distal femur and proximal tibia). Most are solitary, multicentric tumors in the distalextremities. The tumors destroy the overlying cortex, producing a bulging soft tissue massdelineated by a thin shell of reactive tissue.Histopathologically, sheets of uniform oval mononuclear cells and numerous osteoclast-type giantcells are seen with 100 or more nuclei. Necrosis and mitotic activity may be prominent.The image given below shows the histopathological findings seen in osteoclastoma.OsteoclastomaOsteoclastomaMultinucleated Giant cellsMononuclear stromal cellsTypically, they are treated with curettage, but 40% to 60% recur locally.Up to 4% of tumors metastasize to the lungs, but these sometimes spontaneously regress and theyare rarely fatal.

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of an aneurysmal bone cyst.It affects all age groups, but generally occurs during the first 2 decades of life and has no sexpredilection. It usually occurs in the metaphysis of long bones and the posterior elements ofvertebral bodies.This is a tumor characterized by multiloculated blood-filled cystic spaces separated by septae,composed of multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells and reactive woven bone. Radiographically,an aneurysmal bone cyst is seen as an eccentric, expansile, lesion with well-defined margins. Mostlesions are completely lytic and often contain a thin shell of reactive bone at the periphery.The spindle cells of aneurysmal bone cyst frequently demonstrate rearrangements of chromosome17p13, leading to USP6 overexpression.The majority of secondary aneurysmal bone cysts arise in association with:•Benign neoplasmsGiant-cell tumor of the bone (most common)• Chondroblastoma• Osteoblastoma• Fibrous dysplasia• Osteosarcoma",

      "question": "A 60-year-old patient complains of severe back pain for 2 months, which worsens at night. AnMRI shows multiple osteoblastic secondaries on the vertebrae. Which of the following tumorscould be the primary source of these lesions?Renal cell carcinomab) Prostatic adenocarcinomac) Adenocarcinoma lungd) Multiple myelomaAnswer KeyCorrect OptionQuestion No.12Ca304b5b607a8a9b10C11d12b13d14d15016a17a1819ab122120d21b22b23b24bSolution to Question 1:Detailed ExplanationsOsteoclasts are specialized multinucleated macrophages derived from circulating monocytes thatare responsible for bone resorption.Osteocytes are formed when osteoblasts are embedded in the matrix within lacunae andcanaliculi. They control calcium and phosphate levels in the microenvironment.Osteoblasts are mesenchymal cells that rim the bony spicule, responsible for bone synthesis andmineralization.Chondrocytes are specialized cells that produce and maintain the extracellular matrix of cartilage.The image given below shows different cells present in a bone.Osteocyte(maintainsbone tissue)Osteoblast(forms bone matrix)Osteogenic cell(stem cell)Osteoclast(resorbs bone)Solution to Question 2:Osteocalcin is not a bone resorption marker.It is a protein secreted only by osteoblasts. Thus, it is a bone formation marker (osteoblasticmarker).1222Solution to Question 3:Osteochondroma, also known as exostosis, is the most common benign bone tumor.It is a benign cartilage-capped tumor. 85% of osteochondromas are solitary. The remainder isseen as part of the multiple hereditary exostosis syndromes, an autosomal-dominant hereditarydisease.Lesions arise from the metaphysis near the growth plate of long tubular bones, especially near theknee. They are either sessile or pedunculated and range in size from 1 to 20 cm. Histologically, thecap is composed of benign hyaline cartilage varying in thickness and is covered peripherally byperichondrium.Osteochondromas can progress to chondrosarcoma.The image below shows the histopathological specimen of osteochondroma, displaying a cartilagecap lined by perichondrium contiguous with mature bone.Histopathology of OsteochondromaCartilage cap contigouswith mature boneSolution to Question 4:The given clinical scenario is suggestive of osteogenesis imperfecta type II.The type II variant of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is uniformly fatal in utero or during theperinatal period. Type II OI is characterized by extraordinary bone fragility with multipleintrauterine fractures.Osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease) is caused by deficiencies in the synthesis of type Icollagen. It can be separated into four major clinical subtypes that vary widely in severity. Theseverity of the disease is based on the location of the mutation within the protein.Individuals with type I OI have a normal life span, but experience childhood fractures thatdecrease in frequency following puberty.1223Solution to Question 5:This given clinical scenario is suggestive of achondroplasia.Achondroplasia is the most common skeletal dysplasia and a major cause of dwarfism. It hasautosomal dominant inheritance.It occurs due to the gain of mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR3). This leads toabnormal cartilage proliferation at growth plates and affects endochondral bone growth.
