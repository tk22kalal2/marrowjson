      "explanation": "Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is seen in HIV, SLE, CLL, and Hepatitis B.MPGN is caused due to immune-mediated injury. It often presents with a nephritic-nephroticpicture.The causes of MPGN are as follows:• Primary MPGN (Idiopathic)• Secondary MPGN•System lupus erythematosus (SLE)•α1-antitrypsin deficiency• Infections hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, schistosomiasis, endocarditis, infected ventriculoatrialshunts, chronic visceral abscesses•-Malignancies chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)MPGN is characterized by the proliferation of cells predominantly in the mesangium and thecapillary loops. Hence it is also called mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis. There are 2 types ofMPGN:• Type I - It is characterized by the deposition of immune complexes and mesangiocapillaryproliferation.• Type II - It is now known as dense-deposit disease. It belongs to a group of disorders called C3glomerulopathies.Light microscopy findings of MPGN are as follows:• Lobular glomeruli with proliferating mesangial cells, capillary endothelium, and infiltratingleukocytes (endocapillary proliferation)• Duplication of the basement membrane gives a double contour or tram-track appearance. Itis especially evident in silver or PAS stains.799Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis -Light microscopyMembranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis -Light microscopy800",
