      "explanation": "An owl-eyed appearance of giant cells in lymph nodes is characteristic of Hodgkin's lymphoma(HL). Mesenteric lymph nodes are infrequently involved in HL.Hodgkin's lymphoma is a group of lymphoid neoplasms arising in a single group of lymphnodes. Extranodal involvement is uncommon. However, if it spreads from the nodes, the firstorgan to be involved is the spleen, then the liver, and finally the bone marrow. This pattern ofspread is known as the contiguous spread.This predictable route of spread is important clinically as it aids in staging and prognosis as wellas treatment of HL.",

      "explanation": "Activation of the transcription factor NF-κB is a common event in classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). NF-κB may be activated by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. EBV+ tumor cells express latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1), which upregulates NF-κB. Activation of NF-κB may occur in EBV tumors as a result of the acquired loss-of-function mutations in TNF alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3). Activation of NF-κB by EBV rescues crippled germinal center B cells that cannot express Ig's from apoptosis, eventually leading to the formation of Reed-Sternberg cells.",

It is derived from the germinal center B cell. It has a classic owl-eyed appearance due to the presence of a symmetric or mirror-image bilobed nucleus, with prominent nucleoli surrounded by a clear space. It has the following variants: Lacunar, Classic, L&H Popcorn cells, Pleomorphic, and Mononuclear. RS cells should be present in a background of non-neoplastic inflammatory cells like lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils, to make a diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma. The image given below shows the diagnostic Reed-Sternberg cell, with two nuclear lobes, large inclusion-like nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm, surrounded by lymphocytes, macrophages, and an eosinophil. Normally, a lymphocyte and a Reed-Sternberg cell are present. The image below shows a Reed-Sternberg cell, mononuclear variant. The mononuclear variant of the RS cell is shown. The image below shows a Reed-Sternberg cell, lacunar variant. This variant has a folded or multilobated nucleus and lies within an open space, which is an artifact created by disruption of the cytoplasm during tissue sectioning. The lacunar variant of the RS cell is shown. The image below shows the Reed-Sternberg cell, lymphohistiocytic variant.

Clinical features of HL: Painless enlargement of lymph nodes is the most common presenting symptom. Cyclical fever (Pel-Ebstein fever) - cyclical increase, which then decreases over an average period of one or two weeks, and night sweats in disseminated disease. This cyclical fever may be due to the release of cytokines. A unique paraneoplastic syndrome associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma is the occurrence of pain in the affected lymph nodes during alcohol consumption. This has been attributed to the enlargement of the affected lymph nodes following alcohol consumption, which stretches the capsule of the lymph node and produces pain.",

The Reed-Sternberg cells are found in a polymorphous background of T cells, eosinophils, plasma cells, and macrophages. Diagnostic Reed-Sternberg cells are often uncommon. The Reed-Sternberg cells are positive for PAX5 (a B-cell transcription factor), CD15, and CD30, and negative for other B-cell markers, T-cell markers, and CD45 (leukocyte common antigen).
