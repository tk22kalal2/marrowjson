More than 90% of theaffected individuals are smokers.Periductal mastitis is also called recurrent subareolar abscess or squamous metaplasia oflactiferous ducts or Zuska disease. In this condition, a relative deficiency of vitamin A associatedwith smoking or toxic substances in tobacco smoke alters the differentiation of the ductalepithelium.Histologically, there is keratinizing squamous metaplasia of the nipple ducts. Keratin shed fromthese cells is trapped and plugs (keratin plug) the ductal system, causing dilation and eventuallyrupture of the duct. This results in keratin spillage into the surrounding periductal tissue forminga chronic granulomatous inflammatory response.It presents with a painful erythematous subareolar mass that clinically mimics bacterial abscess.It has a high recurrence rate.Squamous metaplasia of lactiferous ductsLactiferous ductopening at nippleMAStratified squamousepithelium occludingthe duotKeratin plugNormal lactiferous duotSquamous metaplasia of lactiferous ductOMARROWStratifiedsquamousepitheliumSmoothmuscle ofareolaNormalcuboidalepitheliumFistula at theedge of areolaAbscess",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "There is no or very slight desmoplastic response seen in lobular carcinomas.Desmoplasia refers to collagenous stromal proliferation induced by tumor cells which is essentialfor tumor growth and spread. It results in hard and stony tumors. However, this is not seen inlobular carcinoma. This is likely due to the loss of expression of CDH1, the gene thatencodes e-cadherin (normally maintains intercellular adhesiveness). This also resultsin disaggregation of cells.Lobular carcinomas are often bilateral and multicentric. It shows characteristic metastatic spread,often involving:• Peritoneum and retro peritoneum• Leptomeninges (carcinomatous meningitis)• Gastrointestinal tract•• Ovaries• UterusHistopathological image of invasive lobular carcinoma of breast showing discohesive cells withfew signet ring cells.1202Lobular Carcinoma of BreastLobular Carcinoma of BreastSignet ring cellsDiscohesive cellsNote: Individuals with heterozygous germline mutations in CDH1 (loss of E-cadherin) also have agreatly increased risk of gastric signet-ring cell carcinoma.",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "T4d in the TNM staging of carcinoma breast points toward a diagnosis of inflammatory breastcarcinoma. It shows extensive invasion and proliferation of tumor cells within the dermallymphatics leading to obstruction.Inflammatory breast cancer is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. The hallmark of thiscondition is the overexpression of e-cadherin. This results in increased tumor cohesion and theformation of tumoral clumps which can result in emboli. It has a particularly poor prognosis.1203These tumors are usually of high grade but do not belong to any particular molecularsubtype. More than half (60%) are ER-negative and 40% to 50% overexpress HER2. There is noassociation with trauma.Due to lymphatic obstruction, it results in brawny induration, erythema with a raised edge, andedema called peau d'orange appearance. This may mimic non-neoplastic inflammatory lesionslike mastitis. A breast lump may or may not be present.The following image shows a peau d'orange appearance of the right breast.",

It presents as asmooth, rapidly growing, multinodular, painless breast lump that is usually palpable. It mostcommonly presents in the 6th decade of life and is associated with:•Gain in chromosome 1q• HOXB13 overexpressionPhyllodes tumors show stromal cellularity next to the epithelium (subepithelial orperiepithelial regions). This feature helps to differentiate it from intracanalicular fibroadenoma.The prognosis of phyllodes tumors depends on their histological grade. Most phyllodes tumors arelow grade, with limited stromal cellularity. They recur only occasionally and do not metastasize.The features of malignant (intermediate and high grade) phyllodes tumors are:• Markedly increased stromal cellularity• Stromal overgrowth - absence of epithelial elements1208• Nuclear atypia• Increased mitosis (&gt;10/ 10 hpf).Highly recurrentRegardless of the grade, lymphatic spread is rare in phyllodes tumors.
