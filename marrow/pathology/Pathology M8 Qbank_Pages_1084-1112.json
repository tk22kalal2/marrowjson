It is part of a larger family of structurallyunique serine protease inhibitors, referred to as serpins. The most common clinically significantmutation in α1-antitrypsin deficiency is PiZZ.α1-antitrypsin, normally present in serum, tissue fluids, and macrophages is a major inhibitor ofproteases (particularly elastase) secreted by neutrophils during inflammation. The absence of α1-antitrypsin activity results in excessive digestion of elastic tissue by elastase.Patients with α1-antitrypsin deficiency have a markedly increased tendency to develop panacinaremphysema.",

It is an end-stage condition of various diseases that result in destruction of the bronchialwall and its surrounding supporting tissues.The normal clearing mechanisms are impaired, either due to congenital causes or due to bronchialobstruction. This results in pooling of secretions, secondary infection, and inflammation, oftenwith necrosis, fibrosis, and eventually cystic dilation of airways up to four times the normal size.Note: Kartagener syndrome is a primary ciliary dyskinesia characterized by the classical triad ofsitus inversus, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis.",

It manifests as pneumoconiotic nodules along withfeatures of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis. Caplan syndrome was first described in coal minersand later in patients with silicosis too.ExposureRadiologic/ Gross findingsClinical manifestationsSilicosisCrystallinesilica-Simple silicosis - small roundedopacitiesin upper lobesComplicated silicosis -Larger opacities > 1cm andeggshell calcificationof hilar lymph nodesAcute silicosis ground-glass opacities on X-ray andcrazy paving patternon HRCT (interlobular septal thickening with background of ground-glass opacity)Increased risk of developing TB and bronchogenic carcinomaAsbestosisAsbestosX-ray shows peripheralreticular opacitiespredominantly in thebasal lobes HRCT shows subpleural fibrotic lines, irregular opacities,tractionbronchiectasis, andhoneycombingIt mainly affects the lowerlobes PFT shows arestrictive patternwith a decreasein lung volumes and diffusing capacityMalignant mesotheliomaMost specific neoplasm associated withasbestosexposureDiffuse gelatinous,greyish-pink lesionarising eitherfrom the visceral or parietal pleura.Strong male predilection3:1Can causemalignant pleural effusion",

      "question": "A 70-year-old patient presented with cough, fatiguability, and weight loss. He was diagnosedwith squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) on bronchoscopy. The resected specimen had a hilarlymph node that was 1cm in size and showed a black pigment. What is the black pigmentlikely to be?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Anthracotic pigment",
        "B": "Melanin",
        "C": "Lipochrome",
        "D": "Hemosiderin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "1109The black-colored pigment in the hilar lymph node of the resected bronchoscopic specimen islikely to be an anthracotic pigment.The black color is due to the deposition of carbon particles. The inhaled carbon particles areengulfed by the lung macrophages and then transported to the hilar lymph nodes.This accumulates and causes the blackening of the lung tissues or anthracosis.It is commonly seen in people who work in environments where there is high air pollution withcarbon particles, such as coal mines. It is also the most common exogenous pigment found in thehuman body as a result of air pollution in urban areas. The aggregates of the carbon dust mayinduce fibroblastic reaction or emphysema that may lead to a condition called coal worker'spneumoconiosis.The following image shows anthracosis with deposition of black carbon particles, within thecytoplasm of macrophages.Anthracotic pigmentation - PulmonaryanthracosisAnthracotic pigmentation - PulmonaryanthracosisBlack colored pigmentin lymph node1110Option B: Melanin is brown-black in color which occurs as a result of oxidation of tyrosine inmelanocytes, as shown in the following histopathology of a lymph node.Melanin pigmentMelaninpigmentOption C: Lipochrome or lipofuscin (brown lipid) is seen as a yellow-brown pigment inhistopathological sections of the liver and heart of normal aging patients, patients with severemalnutrition, and cancer cachexia. It is derived through lipid peroxidation and indicates freeradical injury and lipid peroxidation. The following image shows a cardiac myocyte with fineyellow-brown lipofuscin granules in the perinuclear region.Lipochrome accumulation in cardiac myocyte1111Lipochrome accumulation in cardiac myocyteLipochromepigmentOption D: Hemosiderin is a hemoglobin-derived golden-yellow colored pigment seen in conditionsassociated with iron overload such as hemochromatosis.
