If enzymes hydrolyzing glucose are deficient, there will be anaccumulation of glycogen in the muscles. This will cause muscle weakness due to impaired energyproduction.Enzyme deficiencies leading to muscle glycogen storage include:• McArdle disease/type V glycogenosis - deficiency of muscle phosphorylase•⚫ Type VII glycogen storage disease - deficiency of muscle phosphofructokinaseTypically, individuals with myopathic forms present with muscle cramps after exercise.
