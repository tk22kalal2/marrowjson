      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Neoplastic cells in this condition are usually BCL2 negative, as the tumor in question is likely Burkitt lymphoma, which is known for being BCL2 negative.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The translocation seen in Burkitt's lymphoma is t(8;14), causing translocation of the MYC gene. It is the most common translocation and is seen in 70% of the cases. Other translocations that may be present include t(2;8) and t(8;22).",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "All forms of Burkitt lymphoma are highly associated with translocations of the MYC gene on chromosome 8 that lead to increased MYC protein levels. In addition to the MYC translocations in Burkitt lymphoma and a subset of other B and T cell tumors, MYC is amplified in some breast, colon, lung, and many other carcinomas. The functionally identical NMYC and LMYC genes are also amplified in neuroblastomas and small-cell cancers of the lung, respectively.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma most often presents as a mass involving the ileocecum and peritoneum. About 15 to 20% of these are associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Endemic Burkitt's lymphoma, in contrast, presents as a mass involving the mandible. It shows an unusual predilection for the involvement of abdominal viscera, particularly kidneys, ovaries, and adrenal glands. Involvement of the bone marrow and peripheral blood is uncommon. Immunodeficiency-associated Burkitt's lymphoma commonly involves the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and central nervous system (CNS).",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Burkitt's lymphoma is a very aggressive tumor, having a very high mitotic index and a Ki-67 index of about 100%. Ki-67 is a proliferation marker used to assess the mitotic index of the tumor. It is high in high-grade tumors and low in low-grade tumors. Both mantle-cell lymphoma and DLBCL also have a high Ki-67 index, but it is not as high as that seen in Burkitt's. Follicular lymphoma is a low-grade tumor, and hence, it has a low Ki-67 index.",

The histopathological findings show large cells with multilobed irregular nuclei. These cells are positive for CD20, CD79a, IRF4/MUM1, EBV LMP1. The smaller cells in the background are CD3+, which is a T-cell marker. It is seen in the elderly (over 50 years) and without immunodeficiency or prior lymphoma. 70% of the cases are extranodal and mainly affect skin, lung, tonsil, and stomach with or without lymph node involvement. 30% of the cases have lymph node disease alone. Option A: This is not infectious mononucleosis as the Monospot test is negative. Option B: It is not Hodgkin lymphoma because it is positive for CD20 and CD79a and negative for CD15. Option D: It is not EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer as the patient is immunocompetent and it is strongly positive for CD20. Note: EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer occurs in immunocompromised patients and reverts to treating the immunocompromised state. It shows polymorphous infiltrate and atypical large B cells with RS cell-like morphology admixed with abundant T cells. There is a uniform expression of CD30, MUM1, PAX5, OCT2.

      "explanation": "The transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL) to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is called Richter syndrome. It is seen in approximately 5% to 10% of the cases. Option B: Chédiak-Higashi syndrome is an autosomal-recessive disorder that arises from a mutation of a lysosomal trafficking regulator protein. It leads to a decrease in phagocytosis, recurrent pyogenic infections, albinism, and peripheral neuropathy. Sézary syndrome (SS) is a triad of erythroderma, generalized lymphadenopathy, and the presence of clonally related neoplastic T cells. These cells have cerebriform nuclei (Sézary cells) and are seen in the skin, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood. Kostmann's syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe neutropenia. It is associated with mutations in G-CSF.",

The biopsy shows characteristic large anaplastic cells, some containing horseshoe-shaped nuclei and voluminous cytoplasm called hallmark cells. Biopsy of anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a type of T-cell lymphoma that consists of large lymphoid cells. This occurs due to rearrangements in the ALK gene and usually affects children and young adults. It frequently involves soft tissue and carries a good prognosis. T-cell lymphomas with similar morphology without ALK positivity occur in older adults and have a bad prognosis. CD markers: T cell markers (CD3, CD4, CD8 etc) +, CD30+.",

It accounts for 3% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) in Asia. Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma is highly associated with EBV. The tumor cells typically surround and invade the small vessels, leading to extensive ischemic necrosis. In touch preparations, large azurophilic granules are seen in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells. They express NK-cell markers (CD16, CD56), supporting an NK-cell origin. Most extranodal NK/T-cell lymphomas are highly aggressive neoplasms that respond well to radiation therapy but are resistant to chemotherapy.",

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma occurs in adults infected by human T-cell leukemia retrovirus type 1 (HTLV-1). Common findings include skin lesions, generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and hypercalcemia. Peripheral smear blood shows characteristic cloverleaf cells or flower cells, which are tumor cells with multilobulated nuclei. Lymphocytosis is also observed. It is a rapidly progressive disease that is fatal within months to 1 year. The image given below shows peripheral blood smear findings in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Peripheral smear of Adult T-cell leukemia: Cloverleaf cells. Note: Apart from adult T-cell leukemia, HTLV-1 may also give rise to a progressive demyelinating disease of the CNS and spinal cord.",
