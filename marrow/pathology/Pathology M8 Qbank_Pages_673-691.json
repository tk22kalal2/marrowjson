      "explanation": "The most common form of vascular ectasia is Nevus flammeus. Vascular ectasias are conditions involving the dilatation of blood vessels. They can be congenital or acquired malformations or hamartomas. Telangiectasia is the permanent dilation of small blood vessels. They lead to red lesions in the skin or mucous membranes. Various types of vascular ectasias are as follows: \n   • Nevus flammeus (birthmark): Pink/purple flat lesions on the head or neck. They regress spontaneously. \n   Image showing nevus flammeus in a newborn: \n   • Port-wine stain: A special form of nevus flammeus. It thickens the skin surface. It grows during childhood and does not fade with time. \n   Image showing port-wine stain in a child: \n   • Spider telangiectasias: They are pulsatile and blanch with pressure. These commonly occur on the face, neck, or upper chest. They are associated with hyperestrogenic states, such as pregnancy or liver cirrhosis. \n   Spider Telangiectasia: Central core resembling a spider's body, dilated subcutaneous arteries resembling a spider's legs. \n   • Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu disease) is caused by mutations in genes related to the TGF-β signaling pathway. It is characterized by dilated blood vessels with thin walls that bleed easily. There can be bleeding from the mucous membranes of the nose (epistaxis), tongue, mouth, eyes, and the gastrointestinal tract. \n   The image below shows multiple flat non-pulsating telangiectasias in a patient with Osler-Weber-Rendu disease.",

They are of the following types: • Capillary hemangiomas are the most common type. They occur in the skin, subcutaneous tissues, and mucous membranes of the oral cavities and lips. • Cavernous hemangiomas are composed of large, dilated vascular channels. They are more infiltrative and frequently involve deep structures. They do not spontaneously regress. • Juvenile hemangiomas/strawberry type hemangiomas of the newborn are extremely common. They arise in the skin and grow rapidly for a few months, and usually regress completely by the age of 7 years. • Pyogenic granulomas are capillary hemangiomas that present as rapidly growing red pedunculated lesions on the skin, gingival, or oral mucosa.
