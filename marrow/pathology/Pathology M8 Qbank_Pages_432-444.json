      "explanation": "Hemophilia A and B mostly affect males, but rarely can affect females also.Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder, affecting mainly males and homozygousfemales. Rarely, excessive bleeding occurs in heterozygous females. It is due to the inactivation ofthe X chromosome bearing the normal factor VIII allele by chance in most cells(unfavourable lyonization). About 30% of patients have no family history and the disorder iscaused due to new mutations.Hemophilia B is inherited as X-linked recessive trait. There is a deficiency of factor IX.Hemophilia C is an autosomal-recessive condition and hence can occur in females. There isa deficiency of factor XI.",
