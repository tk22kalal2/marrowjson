Endothelial dysfunction is the pathological alteration of the endothelium such that it becomes pro-inflammatory and prothrombogenic. It is caused by various injuries to endothelial cells: • Hemodynamic stresses - responsible for vascular pathology in hypertension • Lipid products - leading to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis • Advanced glycation end-products (AGE) - responsible for diabetic microangiopathy • Viruses, bacterial products, cytokines, and complement components",

Monckeberg's medial sclerosis affects medium-sized muscular arteries and is characterized by calcification of the medial walls of the affected arteries. Adults aged over 50 years are usually affected. Monckeberg's Medial Sclerosis. Arteriosclerosis refers to the thickening of the arterial wall and loss of elasticity. There are four patterns of arteriosclerosis: \n   • Small vessel arteriosclerosis - involves small arteries and arterioles \n   • It has two variants - hyaline arteriosclerosis, and hyperplastic arteriosclerosis \n   • Monckeberg medial sclerosis - involves calcification of the walls of muscular arteries \n   • Fibromuscular intimal hyperplasia - usually a healing response to inflammation (e.g., arteritis) or mechanical injury (e.g., stent insertion) \n   • Atherosclerosis mainly involves elastic and muscular arteries.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The arteriolar wall thickening in hyaline arteriosclerosis occurs as a result of plasma protein deposition. Hyaline arteriosclerosis occurs due to injury to the endothelial cells. This allows plasma protein leakage into the arteriolar wall. The endothelial injury also stimulates increased matrix synthesis by the smooth muscle cells. These lead to the deposition of homogeneous pink hyaline material, causing the thickening of arteriolar walls.",

      "explanation": "The given image shows hyperplastic arteriosclerosis, as noted by the onion-skin appearance of the arteriole. This is seen in malignant nephrosclerosis. Nephrosclerosis is caused by sclerosis of the small arteries and the arterioles of the kidney leading to diffuse impairment of renal blood supply. It is of 2 types: Benign nephrosclerosis, seen in benign hypertension, causes hyaline arteriosclerosis. Malignant nephrosclerosis, seen in malignant hypertension, causes hyperplastic arteriosclerosis and fibrinoid necrosis of the arterioles. Malignant Nephrosclerosis is characterized by an onion-skin appearance of the arteriole, global and focal glomerulosclerosis. The characteristic flea-bitten appearance of the kidney is seen in malignant nephrosclerosis, due to small petechial hemorrhages resulting from the rupture of arterioles.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "This clinical scenario and image showing occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery are suggestive of atherosclerosis. It progresses in the following sequence: \n      • Endothelial injury and dysfunction\n      • Accumulation of lipoproteins in the vessel wall\n      • Monocyte adhesion to the endothelium\n      • Platelet adhesion\n      • Factor release from activated platelets, macrophages, and vascular wall cells\n      • Smooth muscle cell proliferation, extracellular matrix production, and recruitment of T cells\n      • Lipid accumulation both extracellularly and within cells\n      • Calcification of ECM and necrotic debris late in the pathogenesis\n   Hence, atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory and healing response of the arterial wall to endothelial injury. The two most important causes of endothelial injury leading to atherosclerosis are hemodynamic disturbances and hypercholesterolemia.\n   The image below shows partial occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery.\n   Arterial wall changes in response to endothelial injury\n   Endothelium\n   Tunica intima\n   Tunica adventitia\n   Chronic endothelial injury due to hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidemia\n   Lipoprotein (mainly LDL)\n   Activation of macrophage\n   Macrophage & Smooth muscle\n   Collagen deposition occurs\n   Lipid debris\n   Monocytes adhere and develop into macrophages in response to injury",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The most important independent risk factor for atherosclerosis is family history. The familial predisposition to atherosclerosis is usually polygenic. It is related to the familial clustering of other established risk factors, such as hypertension or diabetes. It may also be due to inherited variations in pathophysiologic processes such as inflammation. Hyperlipidemia (specifically hypercholesterolemia) is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis. Even in the absence of other risk factors, hypercholesterolemia is sufficient to initiate lesion development.",

They indicate a collection of foamy macrophages in the intima of the vessel wall. Fatty streaks may be present in the aorta of infants, virtually all adolescents, and even individuals without known risk factors.

      "explanation": "The cells marked in the image above are the foam cells in atheromatous plaques. They refer to lipid-laden monocytes/macrophages or smooth muscle cells within the plaques. These cells ingest lipoproteins accumulated within the intima of the vessel wall. Since these lipoproteins are modified due to the action of inflammatory mediators, they cannot be degraded further within these cells. This leads to the accumulation of modified lipids within these cells, converting them to foam cells.",

      "explanation": "T-cells and macrophages are in abundance in the shoulder of an atheromatous plaque. Structure of an atherosclerotic plaque: • Superficial fibrous cap - made up of smooth muscle cells and connective tissue, especially collagen. It also contains macrophages, foam cells, and lymphocytes. It determines the stability of the plaque. • Necrotic core - contains lipid (cholesterol and cholesterol esters), debris from dead cells, calcium, and foam cells. • Shoulder - a more cellular area containing macrophages, T-cells, and smooth muscle cells. • Periphery - shows neovascularization/proliferation of small blood vessels.",

      "explanation": "A stable atherosclerotic plaque has abundant smooth muscle cells. These cells synthesize collagen, which stabilizes the plaque. Both these features contribute to a thick fibrous cap that prevents the easy rupture of a plaque. Stable plaque: dense collagen. Vulnerable plaque: less collagen, thin fibrous cap.
