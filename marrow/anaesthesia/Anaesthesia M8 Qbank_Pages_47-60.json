      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given image depicts a pulse oximeter. Pulse oximetry is used for monitoring pulse rate and oxygen saturation of a patient. A small sensor is placed on the finger, toe, earlobe, or another convenient place. The relative absorption of light by oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxyhemoglobin is assessed by measuring the amount of red and infrared light emerging from tissues traversed by light rays and processed by the device, producing an oxygen saturation level. Pulse oximetry does not measure the absolute content or the partial pressures of oxygen or carbon dioxide. A pulse oximeter is not always reliable as it reads: - Falsely high carboxyhemoglobinemia - Falsely low - severe anemia, low cardiac output states, hypovolemia, increased systemic vascular resistance - 80% to 85%, irrespective of the arterial oxygen saturation - methemoglobinemia",

      "options": {
        "A": "Severe anemia",
        "B": "Carbon monoxide poisoning",
        "C": "Increased systemic vascular resistance",
        "D": "Shock"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Carbon monoxide poisoning is associated with a falsely high O2 saturation and is least likely to show low oxygen saturation values. Oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) absorbs more infrared light (940 nm). Deoxyhemoglobin absorbs more red light (660 nm). Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) and HbO2 have a similar absorption spectrum. Thus, in patients with carbon monoxide poisoning, a falsely high SpO2 of 95% is seen, irrespective of the actual SpO2 value. Severe anemia, low cardiac output states, hypovolemia, and increased systemic vascular resistance are associated with falsely low oxygen saturation values. With normal SaO2, anemia has little effect on SpO2. However, in the presence of hypoxia, SpO2 readings underestimate SaO2 in anemic patients.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "CO-oximeter is the best device to detect abnormal hemoglobins. CO-oximeter utilizes an eight-wavelength sensor (unlike pulse oximeter, which uses two wavelengths) to distinguish between oxygenated blood, deoxygenated blood, and blood containing CO. CO-oximeter is useful in measuring: • Carboxyhemoglobin • Methemoglobin",

      "question": "A patient sustained an epidural bleed in a car accident and is brought to the ER. On examination, he has a GCS of 8 and requires immediate intubation. What would be the surest sign of correct placement of the ET tube?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Pulse oximeter",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "End-tidal CO2 measured by capnography is the surest sign of tracheal intubation. It also assesses the adequacy of ventilation in the perioperative period. It can rule out esophageal intubation, where initially carbon dioxide may be detected due to swallowed air, but later once it ceases. It cannot reliably rule out endobronchial intubation, which is indicated by a sudden rise in peak inspiratory pressure. Option C: Physical examination methods such as auscultation of chest and epigastrium, visualization of thoracic movement, and fogging in the tube are not sufficiently reliable to confirm endotracheal tube placement. Options A and D: Similarly, pulse oximetry and chest radiography are not reliable as sole techniques to determine endotracheal intubation.",

        "C": "Arterial carbon dioxide level",
        "D": "Amount of expired carbon dioxide"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Capnography is used to measure the amount of expired carbon dioxide (end-tidal CO2). It is used to confirm tracheal intubation and to assess the adequacy of ventilation in the perioperative period. Arterial carbon dioxide level (PaCO2) is accurately measured using arterial blood gas analysis. The gradient between PaCO2 and EtCO2 (normally 2-5 mm Hg) reflects alveolar dead space (alveoli that are ventilated but not perfused). Although EtCO2 reflects arterial carbon dioxide level (PaCO2), any significant reduction in lung perfusion (e.g., air embolism, decreased cardiac output) increases alveolar dead space, thus increasing the gradient between PaCO2 and EtCO2. Hence, D is the best answer.",

        "C": "Transition gases between airways and alveoli",
        "D": "Alveolar air"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "In a capnographic waveform, the plateau phase corresponds to alveolar air. The normal waveform has four different phases: Phase I: Inspiratory baseline, represents the CO2-free gas from the airways (anatomical and apparatus dead space). Phase II: Expiratory upstroke, mixing of dead space gas with alveolar gas. Phase III: Alveolar plateau, represents CO2-rich gas from the alveoli. The last of the alveolar gas sampled to measure ETCO2. Phase 0: Inspiratory downstroke and the beginning of inspiration. Alpha angle: The transition from phase II to III. The alpha angle can be used to assess the ventilation/perfusion of the lung. V/Q mismatches will have an alpha angle greater than 90 degrees. Beta angle: The transition from phase III to 0. The beta angle can be used to assess rebreathing. If rebreathing occurs, the angle is greater than 90 degrees.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Fall in ETCO2 (end-tidal carbon dioxide) is seen in cardiac arrest due to decreased blood flow to the lungs. Increased ETCO2 is seen in thyrotoxicosis, fever (increased CO2 production) and high spinal anesthesia (alveolar hypoventilation). Factors affecting ETCO2: Increased ETCO2: Metabolism - Hyperthermia, Fever. Decreased ETCO2: Metabolism - Hypothermia. Respiratory - Hypoventilation, Respiratory depression, COPD, Partial airway obstruction, Rebreathing. Circulatory - Increased cardiac output (ROSC after cardiac arrest), Hypertension. Respiratory - Hyperventilation, Total airway obstruction, Extubation. Circulatory - Hypotension, Cardiac arrest, Pulmonary emboli. Increased ETCO2: Apparatus malfunction, Exhausted CO2 absorber, Inadequate fresh gas flow, Ventilatory malfunction. Decreased ETCO2: Apparatus malfunction, Circuit disconnection, Leak in sampling, Ventilatory malfunction.",
