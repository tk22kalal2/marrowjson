      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The nasal cannula is a low flow variable performance oxygen delivery system that can achieve amaximum inspired oxygen concentration of 40-50 % if flow rates are greater than 10L/ min forshort periods.Flow rates greater than 5 L/min are not tolerated because of the discomfort associated with thishigh flow entering the nasal cavity and also due to drying and crusting of the nasal mucosa.At flow rates of 3-4 L, it can provide an inspired oxygen concentration of 30-35%.In mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, the percentage of oxygen delivered is 16%.",

It is not suited forpatients requiring high FiO2 or inspiratory oxygen flow rates greater than 40 L/min for whichdevices like venturi mask, anaesthetic bag, air-entraining nebulizers, or high flow air oxygensystems are preferred.Indications of a nasal cannula and other low-flow oxygen delivery systems include•• Minute ventilation &lt; 8–10 L/min•Breathing frequencies &lt; 20 breaths/min•Normal inspiratory flow (10-30 L/min).•Tidal volumes (VT) &lt; 0.8 L",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "In a choking child (more than 1 year old) or an adult, the first step to be done is to performHeimlich maneuver which involves delivering abdominal thrusts.The rescuer should stand or kneel behind the patient and wrap his arms around the patient'swaist. A fist is made with one hand and using the other hand, the fist is driven into the patient'sabdomen with a rapid, forceful upward thrust so as to dislodge the foreign body. This is continueduntil the foreign body is expelled or if the patient becomes unresponsive.If the patient becomes unresponsive, immediately start CPR.N6.Heimlich maneuver433OMARROWIn a choking infant who is responsive, 5 back slaps between the shoulder blades and 5 downwardthrusts on the chest are given in order to dislodge the foreign body.If the patient becomes unresponsive, immediately start CPR.180Relief of foreignin a responsive infantbody obstructionIn a responsive choking infant, 5 back slaps are given and if the object isnot expelled then 5 chest thrusts are givenOMARROW",

      "question": "In an intubated patient, after what duration of endotracheal intubation will you need toperform a tracheostomy?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Tracheostomy is performed in an intubated patient after 2-3 weeks.This is because if an orotracheal or nasotracheal tube is left in situ for more than 2-3 weeks, itresults in subglottic stenosis.Hence it is ideal to replace the endotracheal tube with a cuffed tracheostomy tube.If on intubation, it is perceived that the patient may require intubation for a period longer than 2weeks, then tracheostomy can be performed soon after intubation.Tracheostomy has been found to reduce the incidence of pneumonia, the duration of mechanicalventilation, and the length of stay in hospitals for patients with major head injuries.",
