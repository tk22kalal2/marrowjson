      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Heat and moisture exchanger (HME) is a passive humidifier, not active.The natural humidification and conservation of heat by the upper respiratory tract is lost orbypassed after tracheal intubation or tracheostomy. HME acts as an artificial nose, which trapsthe exhaled water vapor and heat passively by its hygroscopic material, and thus conserves heatand adds moisture to the inhaled gases.Active humidifiers act by allowing air passage inside a heated water reservoir. These devices areplaced in the inspiratory limb of the ventilator circuit, proximal to the ventilator. After the air isloaded with water vapor in the reservoir, it travels along the inspiratory limb to the patient'sairway.Some humidifiers also serve as filters to trap bacteria/viruses and thus prevent the transmission ofmicrobes from the patient to the machine and hence to other patients.134The disadvantage with the humidifier is that excess saturation can lead to blockage of the circuit.Heat and moisture exchanger (HME)MOMARROWShown above is an HME filter impregnated with a hygroscopic material.Heat and Moisture Exchanger (HME)unit in a PatientOMARROWShown above is the placement of HME filter in the breathing circuit.",
