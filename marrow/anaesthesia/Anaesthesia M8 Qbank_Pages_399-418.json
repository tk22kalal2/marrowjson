      "explanation": "Irradiation of granulocytes before transfusion does not reduce acute hemolytic reaction as it isdue to attack on the transfused donor RBCs by recipient's antibodies and complements.Similarly, the risk of bacterial contamination of platelets and transfusion-related acute lung injury(TRALI) has not decreased with leukoreduction.Irradiation of granulocytes or use of leukoreduced blood components has several advantages overthe use of packed red blood cells:• Decreased risk of graft versus host disease-which is due to engraftment of donor lymphocytesfrom the transfused blood products leading to an immune reaction against recipient tissues• Reduces chances of febrile reactions• Decreases re-perfusion injury (myocardium; after heart by-pass)• Decreases transmission of cytomegalovirus",
