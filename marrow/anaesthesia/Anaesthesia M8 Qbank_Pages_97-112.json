      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Bain circuit belongs to Mapleson's semi-closed breathing system, which lacks a carbon dioxide absorber. Components of Mapleson's system are: breathing tube, fresh gas inlet, adjustable pressure limiting (APL) valve, and reservoir bag. Carbon dioxide absorber (e.g., soda lime) is a component of the closed or circle system. This allows rebreathing of anesthetic gases after the removal of exhaled carbon dioxide. Types of breathing systems include: no reservoir bag (no rebreathing), open, and drop. Classification of breathing systems: APL valve, breathing system (semi-closed, closed), with or without a reservoir bag, and with partial or complete rebreathing. Mapleson's system and circle system are two types of breathing systems. Bain's circuit consists of its components: fresh gas inlet, corrugated breathing tubes, APL valve, and reservoir bag. The circle system consists of its components: CO2 absorber, fresh gas inlet, inspiratory unidirectional valve, and inspiratory breathing tube, a Y-connector, expiratory unidirectional valve, and expiratory breathing tube, APL valve, and reservoir bag.",
