Hofmann eliminationis a spontaneous non-enzymatic degradation of atracurium into laudanosine andmono-quaternary acrylate. Laudanosine has CNS stimulating properties and can result inprecipitation of seizures.Atracurium precipitates as a free acid if it is introduced into an intravenous line containingan alkaline solution such as thiopental.

Its primary mechanism of action is decreasedbreakdown of acetylcholine at the motor endplate.Minor actions:• Increases the release of acetylcholine from motor endplates.• Direct depolarization of the postjunctional motor endplate.It is used for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade produced by non-depolarizing musclerelaxants used during anesthesia.Note: Cobra venom consists of a neurotoxin that is responsible for respiratory paralysis whichsimilar to that produced by a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant. A combination of artificialrespiration and neostigmine is useful in resuscitation.",

      "explanation": "Sugammadex is used for the reversal of rocuronium.Sugammadex is a cyclodextrin. It is the first selective relaxant binding agent. It exerts its reversaleffect by forming tight complexes in a 1:1 ratio with steroidal non-depolarizing agents (rocuronium&gt; vecuronium &gt;&gt; pancuronium).It is eliminated unchanged via the kidneys.",

      "explanation": "Neostigmine is given postoperatively to recover from muscle weakness.215Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants (NDMRs) act mainly by the competitive antagonism ofnicotinic (Nm) receptors. Neostigmine inhibits acetylcholinesterase and inhibits the degradationof acetylcholine. The increased accumulation of undegraded acetylcholine can effectively competewith NDMRs, and thereby displace them from the site and antagonize their effects.216",
