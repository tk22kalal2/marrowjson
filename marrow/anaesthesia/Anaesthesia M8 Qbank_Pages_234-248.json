      "explanation": "Seizures have been associated with the use of sevoflurane in high concentrations, especially in thepediatric population.Emergence from sevoflurane is associated with tonic-clonic movements suggestive of the seizure.Hence sevoflurane must be used cautiously in patients with a known history of seizure.Though isoflurane can cause myoclonus and EEG spiking, frank seizure activity is not seen.Note: Enflurane has the most epileptogenic potential among the inhaled anesthetics.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of myocardial ischemia, hypotension, ST-segment changes, anddecreased cardiac output point towards a diagnosis of coronary steal syndrome.Isoflurane has been associated with myocardial ischemic symptoms, particularly in scenarioswhere coronary perfusion pressure is compromised.It dilates normal coronary arteries, which can redirect blood flow away from areas supplied bystenotic or diseased vessels, worsening ischemia in those regions. This redistribution of blood flowmay contribute to hypotension, ST-segment changes, and reduced cardiac output. However, theseeffects are typically seen when hypotension occurs and can be mitigated by maintaining adequatecoronary perfusion pressure.243",

Desflurane undergoes degradation to produce carbonmonoxide, in the presence of strong bases in dry CO2 absorbents (like desiccated soda lime).CO production is predominantly seen with absorbents that contain sodium or potassiumhydroxide.

The propensity for CO production correlateswith the anesthetic concentration in the breathing circuit (desflurane &gt; enflurane &gt;isoflurane).Amsorb is a CO2 absorbent that is more inert than soda-lime and baralyme and so associated withlesser degradation of anesthetics and so less carbon monoxide production.Sevoflurane, methoxyflurane, and halothane also undergo degradation in the presence of strongbases, but they do not produce CO.",
