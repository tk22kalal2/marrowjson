      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Lumbar epidural is the most commonly used technique to produce labour analgesia because it canprovide analgesia during the first stage of labour and also provide anaesthesia during vaginaldelivery or cesarean section if necessary.For adequate pain relief, the sensory block of T10-L1 is required during the first stage of labourand S2-S4 is required during the second stage. The epidural catheter placed at L3-L4 or L4-L5interspace sufficiently provides T10-S5 neural blockade.Option A: Pudendal nerve block is given in the second stage of labor just before delivery of thebaby to provide analgesia to the vulva and anus. However, it has no effect on the pain ofcontractions. It is also given before repair of episiotomy or perineal lacerations.Option B: Spinal anaesthesia for labour analgesia has the advantage of a rapid and reliable onsetof the neural blockade, and it is technically easier to administer compared to epidural analgesia.However, repeated intrathecal injections may be required for a prolonged labour, thus increasingthe risk of post-dural puncture headache.Option C: Caudal epidural is largely abandoned to provide pain relief in obstetrics. It requireslarge volumes of a local anaesthetic to anaesthetize upper lumbar and lower thoracic dermatomesto provide adequate labour analgesia.

      "explanation": "Very dilute concentration of epinephrine (1:400,000 to 1:800,000) is used along with localanaesthetics for labour epidural analgesia.Epidural epinephrine can provide vasoconstriction which would delay the vascular uptake of localanaesthetic and opioid. Additionally, it can activate ° 2-adrenergic receptors and thus produceanalgesia on its own.Epinephrine, used along with local anaesthetics at a concentration of 5 µg/mL or 1:200,000 maybe associated with uterine artery vasoconstriction which can adversely affect the fetus and delaythe progress of labour. Hence epinephrine at this dose is used only for test dose (15 μg/mL or 3 mlof 1:200,000). A test dose is given to rule out the intravascular placement of epidural catheterfollowing the procedure.",

But in a child withairway obstruction like croup (laryngotracheobronchitis), rapid induction is contraindicated.To perform laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in such children, slow induction of anaesthesiais required before the child becomes sufficiently anaesthetized. Moreover, halothane has a slowerexcretion than sevoflurane, which provides sufficient time for airway management.The therapeutic index of sevoflurane is higher than halothane (myocardial depression,sensitization of the myocardium to arrhythmias, halothane hepatitis) and hence is preferred forroutine cases. However in certain underdeveloped countries, due to its cost-effectiveness,halothane is preferred.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Methohexitone has the potential to cause seizures, hence it is avoided in children with temporallobe epilepsy.Intravenous administration of methohexitone can cause burning, hiccups, apnea, andextrapyramidal-like movements. Due to its potential to cause seizures, it is used to therapeuticallyinduce seizures in electroconvulsive therapy in adults.Option D: Ketamine is contraindicated in patients with increased intracranial tension and betteravoided in epileptic patients due to ketamine-induced myoclonic and seizure-like activity.Options A and C: Propofol and thiopentone have anti-convulsant property.Note: This is a controversial MCQ. Among the above options, methohexitone is the most specificanswer.",

        "C": "Fentanyl",

      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Fentanyl is the most commonly used opioid in infants and children due to its rapid onset andshort duration of action.Termination of its effects is due to rapid redistribution and elimination. It has the advantage ofmaintaining cardiovascular stability while providing anaesthesia. But, fentanyl inducedbradycardia may require treatment with atropine/glycopyrrolate since the cardiac output ofneonates is determined by the heart rate.Option A: Morphine leads to greater respiratory depression in neonates due to slower clearance ofmorphine.Option B: Meperidine / Pethidine is not used in children since long term or repeatedadministration of the drug leads to seizures due to the accumulation of itsmetabolite-normeperidine.Option D: Sufentanil is usually preferred for cardiac anaesthesia.396",

        "D": "Mask ventilation is contraindicated"
      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario is suggestive of pyloric stenosis and the child should be pretreated withatropine if suxamethonium is used during the surgery.For surgical repair in children with pyloric stenosis, either of the following two techniques can bedone:• Rapid-sequence induction - if suxamethonium (2mg/kg) is used, atropine (0.02 mg/kg) should begiven because children are more susceptible than adults to bradycardia and sinus node arrestassociated with suxamethonium.• Awake intubation - preserves airway reflexesThe classically described rapid sequence technique (preoxygenation, cricoid pressure, andavoiding mask ventilation) is not appropriate for an infant with pyloric stenosis.Opton A: Aspiration of gastric contents is done by suctioning with a wide bore vented catheterbefore induction of anaesthesia to remove 98% of gastric contents.Option B: Cricoid pressure can distort the anatomy making laryngoscopy difficult, hence avoided.If it is applied and there is no clear view of the larynx then the pressure should be relaxed.Option D: Infants rapidly desaturate compared to adults due to greater oxygen consumption andsmaller functional residual capacity. This means that gentle bag-mask ventilation is required priorto laryngoscopy to avoid hypoxemia and bradycardia.",

      "question": "Which of the following is the preferred agent used as sedative premedication in pediatricanaesthesia?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Barbiturate",

      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The preferred sedative premedication in children is midazolam.It is preferred as it has a shorter elimination half-life (2 hours) and has the advantage ofproducing anterograde amnesia. It is water-soluble and hence painless on injection. It is usuallyadministered to children 10 to 12 months or older because of separation anxiety from parents.Other sedative premedications that are sometimes used include dexmedetomidine, clonidine,temazepam and ketamine.Option A: Barbiturates are not commonly used for premedication in children since the availabilityof short-acting benzodiazepines. A major disadvantage is hyperalgesia, which can induce agitationin children with pain.Option B: Diazepam has a longer elimination half-life (18 hours) and immature liver function thatwould prolong its action in young children.Option D: Propofol is the most useful sedative-hypnotic drug but is not approved for this use inpediatric patients.Note- Ketamine is effective as a sedative, but it can increase oral secretion and can causehallucinations during recovery. Hence oral ketamine is usually avoided, and when used, isadministered along with antisialogogue (atropine/glycopyrrolate) and a benzodiazepine (such asmidazolam).397",
