Althoughsuccinylcholine causes increase in ICP, it is used in rapid sequence intubation.Succinylcholine has a rapid onset of action and is the shortest acting muscle relaxant. It providesmuscle relaxation within 30-60 seconds.If succinylcholine is contraindicated, then the non-depolarizing muscle relaxant, rocuronium canbe used.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Fade is seen in the non-depolarising phase II block caused by depolarizing muscle relaxants.192Depolarising neuromuscular blockers result in prolonged depolarization with a brief period offasciculations (repetitive excitation) followed by blocking of neuromuscular transmission andflaccid paralysis. This is termed as phase I block and cannot be reversed by neostigmine as themembrane is in a depolarised state.The depolarised nerves are unresponsive to other stimuli during this period.As the concentration of the drug and time increases, the block may convert slowly to anon-depolarising phase II block. Fade can be seen in this phase. The phase II block is reversibleby neostigmine but is difficult to predict and usually avoided in clinical conditions.",

It is seen with a single large dose,repeated doses, or a continuous infusion of Sch which can lead to desensitization of the receptorsresulting in a prolonged neuromuscular blockade.Causes of prolonged apnea include:• Atypical/pseudocholinesterase deficiency - can result in apnea even with a normal dose ofsuccinylcholine• Altered response of endplate to depolarizing relaxant (myasthenia gravis)• Accumulation of succinylcholine leading to phase II blockadeNote: Although options A, B, and D can lead to prolonged apnea, in the above case scenario, thepatient has received ~9 mg/kg of succinylcholine.

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Phase I depolarizing block is preceded by muscle fasciculation.Note: Cholinesterase inhibitors are not routinely used to reverse phase II blockade as certainindividuals have abnormal cholinesterase activity (due to genotypic variations).
