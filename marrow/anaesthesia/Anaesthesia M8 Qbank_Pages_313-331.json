Some studies mention pin prick sensation to be lost before sensation to cold.322But our reference to this MCQ is from standard textbook of anesthesia (Miller's Anesthesia 9thedition).",

      "explanation": "Spinal anesthesia (subarachnoid block, intrathecal block) involves the administration of localanesthetic between the pia and arachnoid mater.In spinal anesthesia, the local anesthetic is injected into CSF, which bathes the nerve root.Hence, a relatively small dose and volume of local anesthetic is sufficient to achieve dense sensoryand motor blockade.Epidural anesthesia involves local anesthetic administration between the dura and ligamentumflavum.

However, at extremes of height, consideration should be given to altering the doseaccordingly.Option A: Advanced age is associated with increased block height, due to decreased CSF volumeOption B: CSF volume is inversely related to the block level.Option D: Patient's position affects the spread of hyperbaric and hypobaric solutions.

      "explanation": "The gender of the patient is the factor that least affects the height of the neuraxial block, amongthe options given.Theoretically, the density of CSF is lower in women than in men. Although this may affect relativebaricity of local anaesthetics, the clinical variation in the spread is probably unimportant. Hence,this is the best answer to choose from the above options.Option A: Higher anaesthetic levels are achieved in the elderly for a given dosage of spinalanaesthetic.Option C: Increased intraabdominal pressure or conditions that cause engorgement of theepidural veins, decrease CSF volume and thus increase block height. This includes conditions suchas pregnancy, ascites, and large abdominal tumors.Option D: Within the range of \"normal-sized” adults, patient height does not seem to affect thespread of spinal anaesthesia. But, extremes of height can affect the block height.324",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "To prevent hemodynamic disturbances, we must prevent the migration of the spinal block toupper thoracic segments. In the sitting position, this can be achieved by using a hyperbaricsolution like bupivacaine with glucose.Baricity of local anesthetics refers to the specific gravity of the solution with respect to that ofCSF.A hyperbaric solution (addition of glucose) of local anesthetic is denser (heavier) than CSF, ahypobaric solution (addition of sterile water or fentanyl) is lighter than CSF and isobaric solution(plain or 1:1 CSF) has density same as that of CSF.Hyperbaric solution tends to move to the dependent area of the spine. While a hypobaric solutionmoves to the non-dependent area. An isobaric solution remains at the level of injection.With the patient in a head-down position, a hyperbaric solution spreads cephalad, and ahypobaric solution moves caudally.In clinical practice, hyperbaric solutions are most commonly used during spinal anesthesia. Ahypobaric solution is only used in prone jackknife position to specifically block the operative sitearound perineum during certain anorectal surgeries.329",

      "explanation": "The landmarks depicted in the image are in reference to caudal anaesthesia. It is a commonregional technique in paediatrics for procedures below the diaphragm, including urogenital,rectal, inguinal, and lower extremity surgery.Caudal anaesthesia involves deposition of local anaesthetic in the caudal epidural space, accessedthrough the sacral hiatus. Sacral hiatus is formed by the unfused S4 and S5 laminae and iscovered by the sacrococcygeal ligament.The lines joining the posterior superior iliac spines and sacral hiatus make an equilateral triangle.The sacral hiatus is felt as a groove or notch above the coccyx and between two bony prominences,the sacral cornua.It is better appreciated in children than in adults and hence it is a common regional techniqueamong pediatric patients.Sacral canalSacral hiatusDural sacMACaudal blockOMARROWSacrococcygealligamentPosterior superioriliac spineSacral hiatus331",
