      "explanation": "Local anesthetics block nerve conduction by decreasing the influx of sodium ions into the cells.Normally, sodium influx is followed by slight depolarization of the membrane.Local anesthetics in unionized form cross the cell membrane and are converted to ionized formsinside the cytoplasm the sodium channel blockade occurs. Resting/closed conformation of thesodium channels have relatively low affinity for local anesthetics.",

      "explanation": "The addition of sodium bicarbonate to local anesthetics does not reduce local anesthetic toxicity.All local anesthetics are weak bases, but commercially available solutions have an acidic pH inorder to maximize the stability and shelf life. In acidic solutions, most of the drug will bein ionized form. It is only the uncharged (non-ionized) form that diffuses across the lipid barrierto the site of action.A basic solution (sodium bicarbonate) can be added to a local anesthetic solution immediatelybefore injection to raise the pH. This is termed 'alkalinization' or 'buffering'. Alkalinizationincreases the proportion of non-ionized drug resulting in more rapid drug diffusion.Advantages of alkalinization:• Faster onset of action• Reduced pain/stinging on subcutaneous injection•Improved quality of the block1mL 8.4% sodium bicarbonate is added to 10 mL of local anesthetic solution.Excessive sodium bicarbonate raises the pH too far and precipitates non-charged basic form in thesolution.",

      "explanation": "The manifestations of shellfish poisoning are due to the action of the poison on the outer pore ofthe voltage-gated sodium channel.Shellfish poisoning is due to the neurotoxin saxitoxin and puffer fish poisoning is due totetrodotoxin. Although these toxins are chemically distinct, they are exceedingly potent and havesimilar mechanisms of action.While local anesthetics inhibit sodium channel activity by binding to the inner pore (fromintracellular side), these toxins bind to the outer pore of the channel. As a result, the actionpotential is blocked.Unlike local anesthetics, these neurotoxins are very specific to neuronal Na channels, hencecardiac and neurological side effects are low.Treatment includes gastric lavage, vasopressors. Mechanical ventilation may be required ifrespiratory paralysis sets in.Prognosis is good when the patient survives after 24 hours.",
