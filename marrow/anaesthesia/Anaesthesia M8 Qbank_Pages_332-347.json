However, it can occur in the setting of high spinal up to the cervicallevel and total spinal anesthesia.Blockade of the intercostal and abdominal muscles during neuraxial anesthesia is adequatelycompensated by an unaltered function of the diaphragm and other accessory respiratory muscles.Systemic toxicity of the local anesthetic would mainly affect the central nervous system andcardiovascular system.",
