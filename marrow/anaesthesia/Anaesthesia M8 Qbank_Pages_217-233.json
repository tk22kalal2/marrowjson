Nitrous oxide increases cerebral metabolic rate.Nitrous oxide increases cerebral metabolic rate, cerebral oxygen consumption, and cerebral bloodflow. Hence it is not preferred in neuro anesthesia as it increases intracranial pressure.Option A: N2O has a MAC value of 104%, which makes it the least potent inhaled anesthetic.Hence it is always used in combination with the more potent volatile agents.Option B: N2O has low blood-gas solubility resulting in phenomena such as second gas effect,concentration-effect, and diffusion hypoxia.Option D: N2O acts as an antagonist at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which areexcitatory receptors in the brain.",

This isbecause of the greater reduction in cardiac output caused by halothane than the other volatileagents.Hepatic arterial buffer response(HABF) is an autoregulatory mechanism in the liver. When portalblood flow decreases due to decreased cardiac output or hypovolemia, the hepatic arterial bloodflow increases in order to maintain total hepatic blood flow. Halothane disrupts this regulatorymechanism, which is best preserved with sevoflurane or isoflurane.Desflurane and sevoflurane have the least significant effects on total hepatic blood flow andoxygen delivery.

      "options": {
        "A": "Halothane",
        "B": "Nitrous oxide",
        "C": "Sevoflurane",
        "D": "Desflurane"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Nitrous oxide inhibits vitamin B12 dependent enzymes like thymidylate synthetase, which isnecessary for DNA synthesis - this is responsible for the megaloblastic bone marrow changes.Megaloblastic anemia is seen with nitrous oxide especially when exposure is greater than 2-6hours (in healthy patients prolonged periods of exposure &gt; 12 hours is required whereas, incritically ill patients, much shorter periods of exposure can lead to megaloblastic changes in thebone marrow).Side effects of nitrous oxide:• Bone marrow depression• Subacute combined degeneration of the cord•Teratogenicity• Peripheral neuropathyContraindications of nitrous oxide:232•· Venous or arterial air embolism• Pneumothorax••• Acute intestinal obstruction with bowel distentionIntracranial air (pneumocephalus following dural closure or pneumoencephalography)• Pulmonary air cysts• Intraocular air bubbles•Tympanic membrane grafting233",
