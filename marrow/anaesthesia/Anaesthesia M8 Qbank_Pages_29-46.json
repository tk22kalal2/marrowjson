      "explanation": "Capnography is a measurement of end-tidal CO2, which is used to confirm tracheal intubation and assess ventilation in the perioperative period. Cardiac output measurement techniques include: Thermodilution, dye dilution using indocyanine green, lithium dilution, pulse contour devices, esophageal doppler, thoracic bioimpedance, and echocardiography. Note: The thermal dilution method uses a non-toxic liquid with a temperature different from the blood. This fluid is injected into a vein and is detected on the arterial side using a catheter with a temperature sensor. The rate of flow of this liquid is used to calculate the cardiac output.",

Preoperative cardiac stress testing can help identify the presence and severity of preexisting CAD. The prognostic performance of these tests is better assessed based on positive and negative likelihood ratios. Among all the given options, dobutamine stress echocardiography has the maximum positive likelihood ratio and hence provides the most accurate prognostic information.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "0.5 ml of heparin is not added to the syringe before taking blood. Very little heparin is needed in the sample to prevent clotting; 0.05 to 0.10 ml of a dilute solution will help prevent coagulation of 1 ml of blood without affecting its pH. This is achieved by drawing 0.5 ml into the syringe and flushing it out. The residue that remains adherent to the syringe is sufficient for the procedure. Heparin must be added to the syringe as an anticoagulant. Because the pH of heparin is near 7.0, and the Po2 and Pco2 of the heparin solution are near room air values, excess heparin can alter ABG measurements. After flushing the syringe with heparin, a sufficient amount usually remains in the dead space of the syringe and needle for anticoagulation without distortion of the ABG determination. Note: Modified Allen's test positive indicates that the collateral blood flow is normal. Modified Allen's test negative indicates that the collateral blood flow is abnormal and an alternate site must be chosen.",
