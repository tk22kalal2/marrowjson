      "question": "A 4-year-old child is observed to have difficulty in breathing along with bluish discolourationof his lips and fingers while playing. It improves on adopting a knee-chest position. Which isthe ideal induction agent of choice used for surgical correction of the condition suffered bythis patient?",
      "options": {

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Ketamine is the induction agent of choice in this patient who is likely suffering from tetralogy ofFallot because it maintains or increases systemic vascular resistance and increases cardiac output.Tetralogy of Fallot is characterized by sub pulmonic stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy,ventricular septal defect and overriding of the aorta. This results in a right to left shunt through369the ventricular septal defect and consequent cyanosis.The commonest symptoms are dyspnea on exertion and exercise intolerance and develop blueskin (cyanosis) when agitated and are known as tet spells. The patients assume a sitting posture(squatting) or knee-chest position as soon as they get dyspneic, which leads to temporarysymptomatic relief.Ketamine does not aggravate the right to left shunt seen in such cases. It also does not increasepulmonary vascular resistance in children as compared to adults and is hence safe to administerin children.Ketamine is the agent of choice in all cyanotic congenital heart diseases.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Wide fixed split S2 is suggestive of atrial septal defect (ASD) and sevoflurane is the inhalationalagent of choice for induction in a child undergoing cardiac surgery.Halothane and sevoflurane are non-pungent and hence can be used for induction in pediatricpatients. Sevoflurane is not associated with significant myocardial depression as is seen withhalothane. Hence, sevoflurane is preferred over halothane especially in all cardiovascularsurgeries in the paediatric age group.Following induction, isoflurane and sevoflurane are the most commonly used inhalation agentsfor maintenance.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "General anaesthesia is preferred in patients with severe aortic stenosis.Spinal and epidural anaesthesia are relatively contraindicated. This is because regionalanaesthesia produces profound hypotension which can lead to a fall in preload, afterload or both.Most general anaesthetics especially the volatile agents also cause vasodilation and hypotensionwhich can be treated with escalating doses of vasopressors like phenylephrine.Mild to moderate aortic stenosis are not contraindications to regional anaesthesia. In suchsituations, epidural anaesthesia is preferred over spinal because of its slower onset of hypotensionwhich can be adequately corrected.",

        "D": "The surgeon has no role in the management of VAE"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The correct statement regarding venous air embolism (VAE) is, a decrease in oxygen saturationwill not always be seen, even with larger emboli.VAE can occur when the pressure within an open vein is subatmospheric. It can occur in anyposition or procedure, whenever the wound is above the level of the heart. The incidence ofvenous air embolism is greater during sitting craniotomies than in craniotomies in any otherposition.Option A: Physiological monitors (heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and end-tidalcarbon dioxide) have poor sensitivity and specificity and the clinical signs are manifestedlate. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is the most sensitive method to monitor and candetect up to 0.02ml/kg of air embolism.Option C: Patients with a right to left shunt are susceptible to paradoxical air emboli which canresult in a stroke or coronary occlusion.Option D: The surgeon should be notified immediately so that he or she can flood the surgicalfield with saline or pack it with wet gauzes and apply bone wax to the skull edges until the entrysite is identified and occluded.",

If the serum potassium is increased, then anon-depolarizing muscle relaxant like atracurium or cisatracurium which is non-dependent onrenal excretion is to be used. Atracurium or cisatracurium undergo Hofmann elimination which isnon-enzymatic spontaneous degradation.Pancuronium is almost entirely dependent on the kidney for excretion (60-90%). Pancuroniumhas a prolonged elimination half-life in renal failure patients and thus should be used verycautiously.40-60% of d-tubocurarine is excreted via the kidney and so prolonged effects are seen with renalinsufficiency371",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Remifentanil is the opioid that was most likely used in this elderly patient.Remifentanil is hydrolysed by plasma and tissue esterases and so its metabolism is independent ofhepatic and renal function- no dose adjustment is required and is safe in liver failure patients andrenal failure patients.Because of this hydrolysis, it has a high clearance and is eliminated rapidly with a quick recovery (half-life less than 10 minutes) and thus is preferred in elderly patients.",

It maintains hemodynamic stability in patients with hypovolemic shock, is a potentbronchodilator, and causes minimal respiratory depression.

Also, LA toxicitycan occur because of the high systemic absorption.Option A: General Anaesthesia is more invasive to manage patient with multiple rib fractures andhas potentially more side effects and complications than Epidural Anaesthesia. Endotrachealintubation as treatment is reserved only for patients who cannot maintain an airway or maintainsufficient oxygen saturation.Option B: Spinal anaesthesia involves a high level of anaesthesia which is required to cover thethoracic dermatomes which would lead to high spinal or total spinal anaesthesia.Option D: Infraclavicular block is a brachial plexus block that is used for the upper limbs.",

Itshould be avoided in patients who are on monoamine oxidase inhibitors as the interaction canresult in high blood pressure.Option B: Phenylephrine is an ° -adrenergic agonist topical vasoconstrictor. It can cause severehypertension and blood pressure monitoring is required.Option C: Cocaine has cardiovascular effects- it is sympathomimetic and when administered at aconcentration of 4%, it inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine at sympathetic nerve terminalsthus making it unsafe in patients with coronary artery disease or those on monoamine oxidaseinhibitors.Option A: Lidocaine as such does not have vasoconstrictor properties but may be used withphenylephrine.",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Continuous epidural anesthesia is the first choice for most patients with preeclampsia duringlabor, vaginal delivery, and cesarean section.Pre-eclampsia patients have a risk of severe airway edema, which makes intubation difficult. Thuscontinuous epidural anesthesia is advantageous as it avoids the need for intubation. Besides,continuous epidural anesthesia can improve uteroplacental perfusion and also decreasecatecholamine secretion.But one major prerequisite for regional anesthesia in preeclamptic patients is normal plateletcount and normal coagulation. Coagulopathy is a contraindication for regional anesthesia.Minimal platelet count for regional anesthesia is 100,000/μL, but some cases can be taken up witha platelet count as low as 70,000/μL.General anesthesia is indicated in patients with coagulopathy and in severe pre-eclampsia withcomplications.Spinal anesthesia can be given in mild pre-eclampsia but hypotension associated with spinalanesthesia limits its use in moderate to severe pre-eclampsia.Since the severity of pre-eclampsia or the type of delivery (vaginal or cesarean) is not mentioned,epidural anesthesia has an advantage over other techniques for above-mentioned reasons. Hencethe best option here would be epidural anesthesia.",
