      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Bag and mask ventilation can be performed in patients with a difficult airway. Bag and mask ventilation serves as a rescue technique to provide oxygenation and ventilation in patients with a difficult airway until tracheal intubation is achieved. Contraindications of bag and mask ventilation include patients at greater risk of aspiration, such as patients with diaphragmatic hernia and those undergoing rapid sequence induction and intubation. This is because air can enter the stomach, leading to raised intragastric pressure, which increases the risk of aspiration. Mask ventilation should also be performed with caution in patients with severe facial trauma and in patients in whom head and neck manipulation must be avoided (e.g., those with an unstable cervical spine fracture).",

      "question": "You are a resident posted in the medicine ward. A patient who has been previously diagnosed with epilepsy has an episode of seizures and becomes unconscious. You immediately call a code. The patient is unresponsive and chest rise is not appreciable, but you can feel a pulse. You suspect that this is due to the falling back of the tongue and decide to secure the airway using the device shown. What landmarks would you use before selecting the appropriate size?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Incisor teeth and tragus of the ear",
        "B": "Corner of mouth and angle of mandible",
        "C": "Tip of nose and angle of mandible",
        "D": "Ala of nose and angle of mandible"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The image shows an oropharyngeal airway or Guedel airway of various sizes. The landmarks used for measuring the appropriate size of this device are the corner of the mouth and the angle of the mandible or tragus. An oropharyngeal airway is an airway adjunct which keeps the tongue from falling back onto the posterior pharynx. It is essential to choose the correct size since inappropriately sized ones may aggravate airway obstruction. These airways should not be used in conscious patients as they may come into contact with the epiglottis and base of tongue. This can cause coughing, retching, or laryngospasm if the pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes are not blunted with local anesthetic. Note: Nasopharyngeal airway size is chosen by measuring the distance between the tip of the nose and tragus of the ear. These airways, when well lubricated and inserted with proper technique, can be used in conscious patients to secure an airway.",

        "D": "Can be used in patients with central facial fracture"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The image shows a nasopharyngeal airway and its insertion. The true statement is that it is used to prevent falling back of tongue post-extubation, especially in obese patients. Nasopharyngeal airways are less stimulating than oropharyngeal airways as they bypass the gag reflex. Thus, they can be used in conscious patients as well. It does not prevent tongue bite, unlike the oropharyngeal airway, which has a bite block. It can prevent falling back of the tongue in patients with seizures. It is contraindicated in basilar skull fractures, central facial fractures, CSF rhinorrhea - risk of meningitis; patients on anticoagulants, coagulopathies, epistaxis - risk of bleeding; relatively contraindicated in pregnancy (increased vascularity leading to bleeding), deformity of the nose.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The image shown above is the technique of insertion of a laryngeal mask airway. Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is a supraglottic airway device that is positioned in the hypopharynx. Classic Laryngeal Mask Airway: Mask, Airway tube, Cuff, Aperture Valve, and Inflation indication balloon, Inflation line, Airway connector. Classic Laryngeal Mask Airway: Supraglottic airway devices are used with both spontaneously and ventilated patients during anesthesia. LMA has advantages of being used in many settings, including the operating room (alternate route of ventilation), the emergency department (difficult intubation), and out-of-hospital care (paramedics). This is because it is easy to use, quick to place even for the inexperienced provider, and has a very high success rate. The technique of insertion: The deflated cuff of LMA is lubricated and inserted blindly into the hypopharynx so that, once inflated, the cuff forms a low-pressure seal around the entrance to the larynx. Correct placement of the tube is confirmed by giving gentle positive pressure ventilation while checking for chest rise and ETCO2 using capnography. Insertion of Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA): Larynx, Trachea, Esophagus. Deflated cuff of LMA inserted with head held in extended position. LMA advanced till resistance is felt and cuff is inflated. Note: Oropharyngeal airway: inserted in the patient's mouth with concavity towards the hard palate. As the airway is inserted, it is rotated 180 degrees (concavity towards the tongue) until the flange comes to rest on the patient's lips. Oropharyngeal airway insertion. Nasopharyngeal airway: inserted through the nostril (after lubrication) along the natural curvature of the floor of the nasal cavity with the bevel pointing towards the septum. Once the device is inserted, the flange should rest on the nostril opening. Endotracheal tube: inserted infraglottically after visualizing the vocal cords with direct laryngoscopy.",

      "explanation": "Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is indicated in cases with difficult airway where endotracheal intubation is not possible or not available. It can be used as an alternative to an endotracheal tube for ventilating and oxygenating the patient. LMA is relatively contraindicated in conditions that are associated with increased risk of aspiration (e.g.: hiatal hernia, pregnancy, inadequate NPO). LMA may protect the larynx from pharyngeal secretions but not from gastric secretions. The presence of a pharyngeal pathology such as an abscess or tumor, or a pharyngeal obstruction is also a relative contraindication of LMA insertion. The normal anatomic position of the LMA. The proximal portion of the LMA rests upon the epiglottis, whereas the distal end, or the tip, extends into the pharynx at the upper end of the esophagus. The opening on the laryngeal mask overlies the laryngeal inlet. Epiglottis, Laryngeal, Normal Anatomic Position of LMA, mask airway, Trachea, Oesophagus.",

      "explanation": "Proximal portion of LMA rests upon the epiglottis and the distal end extends till the upper end of the oesophagus. ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is a reusable second-generation supraglottic airway device, not a single-use device. It also has an integrated bite block, a drainage tube to remove gastric secretions, and an improved cuff design. This reduces the risk of aspiration. Hence, it may be suitable in non-supine positions (e.g., lateral, prone), laparoscopic surgery (e.g., cholecystectomy, gynaecological surgery), and in patients who are obese.",

The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is a supraglottic airway device that sits in the hypopharynx and partially protects the larynx from pharyngeal secretions, but not gastric regurgitation. Advantages: Easy and rapid, less invasive, better hemodynamic stability. Very useful in difficult intubations, less tooth and laryngeal trauma, does not require muscle relaxation, and does not require neck mobility. Disadvantages: increased risk of gastrointestinal aspiration, less safe in prone or jack-knife positions, less secure airway, greater risk of gas leak and pollution, and can cause gastric distention.",
