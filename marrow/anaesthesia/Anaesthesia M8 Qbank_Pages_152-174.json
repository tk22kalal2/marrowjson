      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The patient is in atrial fibrillation but his hemodynamic status is normal. So the treatment ofchoice is IV Ibutilide.Ibutilide is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that has a rapid onset of action. It restores sinusrhythm by prolonging the action potential duration and effective refractory period.It is administered at a dose of 1 mg over 10 minutes. If necessary, a second dose can beadministered 10 minutes after the first.If there is evidence of hemodynamic deterioration, immediate cardioversion is the treatment ofchoice.Cardioversion is a synchronized administration of shock as the timing is typically synchronizedwith the R waves or QRS complex of a cardiac cycle. On the other hand, random administration ofshock anywhere in between a cardiac cycle is termed as Defibrillation which is non-synchronized.However, the mechanism for both processes is quite similar. The electric current is made to travelfrom the negative to the positive electrode in such a way that it traverses the entire myocardium atonce to conduct a simultaneous contraction of each cell of the heart muscle. It is made tointerrupt any ongoing abnormal electrical activity by terminating it so that the sinus node cantake back the charge and resume its normal pacemaker activity.Cardioversion is typically performed under induction or sedation using a short-acting agent suchas midazolam, unless the patient is hemodynamically unstable or if cardiovascular collapse isimminent. Defibrillation is more of an emergent maneuver and, when necessary, should bepreferably performed in conjunction with or prior to the administration of induction or sedativeagents.Energy may be delivered through mainly two waveforms in defibrillators that are monophasic orbiphasic.166Monophasic defibrillation delivers a charge in only one direction as opposed to biphasicdefibrillation delivering a charge in one direction for half of the shock and in the electricallyopposite direction for the second half.Biphasic waveforms are adopted in newer defibrillators as they deliver a more consistentmagnitude of the current which successfully terminates arrhythmias at lower energies thanmonophasic waveform defibrillators.Energy selection for defibrillation or cardioversion. Following are the guidelines for initial energyrequirements issued by the American Heart Association in 2010.Atrial fibrillation energy requirements are as follows:• 200 Joules for monophasic devices• 120-200 Joules for biphasic devicesAtrial flutter energy requirements are as follows:⚫ 100 Joules for monophasic devices• 50-100 Joules for biphasic devicesVentricular tachycardia with pulse energy requirements are as follows:• 200 Joules for monophasic devices• 100 Joules for biphasic devicesVentricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia energy requirements are as follows:• 360 Joules for monomorphic devices• 120-200 Joules for biphasic devicesIndications for electrical cardioversionSupraventricular tachycardia(atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia [AVNRT] andatrioventricular reentrant tachycardia [AVRT])Atrial fibrillationAtrial flutter(types I and II)Ventricular tachycardia(with a pulse)Any patient withre-entranttachycardia withnarrow or wide QRScomplex (ventricular rate >150 bpm) who isunstable(eg, ischemic chest pain, acute pulmonary edema, hypotension, acute altered mental status, signs of shock)Indications for defibrillationPulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT)Ventricular fibrillation (VF) Cardiac arrestdue to orresulting in VF167Management of Atrial FibrillationProsentAtrial fibrillationHemodynamio instability orevidence of pre-excitationAbsentSynchronised direct currentcardioversionLeft atrial dilation >-4 cmRate control strategy<40 hoursNo risk ofthromboembolismRhythm control strategy wpharmacological cardioversion3 weeks of anticoagulationThrombus absentRhythm control strategy anpharmacological cardioversion4 weeks of anticoagulationEchocardiogramLeft atria normal+Check for the duration ofatrial fibrillation>40 hours or unknownduration2 approachesStart anticoagulationTransesophageal ECHO orcardiac CTThrombus presentAnticoagulation for 3 weekstill the clot resolvenRate control strategy:- No heart failure or hypotension: ẞ blockers or calcium channel blockers- Presence of heart failure or hypotension: Amiodarone or digoxinRhythm control strategy / Pharmacological cardioversion!Class 10 anti arrhythmic drugs (flecainide), or amiodarone, or ibutilide,or dofetilideOMARROW",

      "explanation": "The ECG rhythm shown is ventricular fibrillation which is treated by immediate defibrillation.The management of ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia (shockablerhythms) is the same. Immediate chest compression is to be started.It is of utmost necessity to defibrillate at the earliest because the chances of survival decrease by7-10% every minute without defibrillation.Defibrillation involves delivering an electrical current between two pads placed on the chest so asto interrupt the disorganized cardiac activity and restore an organized cardiac rhythm or asystolefor at least 5 seconds.The energy that must be applied is•Monophasic defibrillator- 360 JBiphasic defibrillator- 120 J171",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Chest compressions should be resumed immediately following shock delivery.Pulse check and reanalysis of the cardiac rhythm is performed only after 2 minutes of chestcompression and rescue breaths. This is because the heart is temporarily stunned by adefibrillator shock and so chest compressions would benefit the patient by providing coronaryblood flow during this period.Defibrillation involves delivering an electrical current between two pads placed on the chest so asto interrupt disorganized cardiac activity and restore an organized cardiac rhythm or asystole forat least 5 seconds. It is of utmost necessity to defibrillate immediately because the chances ofsurvival decrease by 7-10% every minute without defibrillation.If after 2 minutes, the rhythm remains the same, then another shock is delivered. Chestcompression and rescue breaths are resumed and 1 mg epinephrine is administered.Consideration is given for an advanced airway placement.If after 2 minutes the rhythm still remains the same, the first dose of amiodarone 300mg bolus isgiven.With the next cycle of CPR, a shock is delivered and 1 mg of epinephrine is given. And with thecycle of CPR after that, shock is delivered and the second dose of amiodarone- 150mg is given",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Vasopressin was a part of the resuscitation protocol in the 2010 American Heart Association(AHA) cardiac arrest algorithm but it has been removed from the 2015 guidelines.Vasopressin causes intense peripheral vasoconstriction due to stimulation of V1 receptors in theendothelium but it causes a limited increase in myocardial contractility, myocardial and cerebraloxygen consumption, and metabolic demands. Thus it doesn't have much of a survival benefit.Epinephrine and amiodarone are the two main drugs approved by the AHA for resuscitation of apatient in cardiac arrest.The first dose of epinephrine,1 mg IV, is administered after the 2nd defibrillator shock is deliveredand it is continued every 3-5 minutes.If this is not effective, 300 mg IV bolus dose of amiodarone can be given and another dose of 150mg given if necessary",

      "explanation": "Intravenous Adrenaline is the drug of choice for CPR. However, adrenaline can be givenintratracheally also. The concentration required for intratracheal administration is 2-2.5 timesmore than required for the IV route.172Option B: Intracardiac injection is not recommended as it can cause myocardial damage.Recommended routes for adrenaline are intravenous, intraosseous (children), and intra-tracheal.Option C: Adrenaline converts fine fibrillation to coarse fibrillation which then responds well todefibrillation.Option D: Adrenaline is available as a 1 mL injection containing 1 mg of adrenaline in 1:1000concentration. The dose used in cardiac arrest is 1mg of adrenaline every 3-5 minutes, usuallygiven as 1ml in 1:1000 concentration or 10ml in 1:10,000 concentration (more preferred since incardiac arrest peripheral circulation is absent; hence larger volume is required for the drug toreach the central circulation).",

The drugsshould be diluted in 10 ml of normal saline or distilled water for adults and 5 ml for children.When there is no intravenous access, the intraosseous route is preferred over the endotrachealroute because the optimal dose via the endotracheal route is not known.
