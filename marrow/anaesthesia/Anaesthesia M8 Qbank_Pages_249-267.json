It is due to defect in mitochondrial metabolism and electron transport chain function.",

      "explanation": "Robin Hood or reverse steal phenomenon is seen with thiopentone.Thiopentone constricts the cerebral vasculature, causing a decrease in cerebral blood flow,cerebral blood volume, and intracranial pressure. However, this vasoconstriction occurs only innormal areas. The blood vessels in the ischemic area remain dilated due to ischemia-inducedvasomotor paralysis and are unaffected by thiopentone. This leads to redistribution of blood flowfrom normal to ischemic areas in the brain. This is called the Robin Hood phenomenon.",
