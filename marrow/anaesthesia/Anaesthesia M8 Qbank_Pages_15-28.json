      "explanation": "ASA-PS classification describes a patient's preoperative medical status and strongly correlates with the perioperative risk. The ASA classification system alone does not predict the perioperative risks, but when used with other factors like the type of surgery, frailty, and level of deconditioning of the patient, it can be helpful in predicting perioperative risks. Option A: ASA-PS is used to quantify the risk for patients who require anesthesia, not assess intubation difficulty. Option B: Brain dead patients are classified as ASA-PS class VI. Option C: A patient with anemia without functional limitation (no symptoms) is classified as ASA-PS class II.",

However, low-dose aspirin should be continued to prevent cardiovascular thrombotic events in the following cases: \n• Patients with a prior PCI (Percutaneous coronary intervention) \n• Patients with coronary artery disease \n• Patients with stroke in the past 9 months. In addition, aspirin should be continued in patients requiring CABG. This is due to the associated increase in in-hospital mortality if discontinued.

      "explanation": "Aspirin should be continued in patients requiring a CABG procedure. Discontinuation of aspirin in patients requiring a CABG procedure is associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Hence, aspirin is continued before the procedure. The approach for most surgical patients is to discontinue aspirin temporarily for 3 days before surgery to mitigate potential intraoperative bleeding. However, the drug should be continued to prevent cardiovascular thrombotic events in the following: • Patients with a prior PCI (Percutaneous coronary intervention) • Patients with coronary artery disease • Patients with a stroke in the past 9 months.

        "D": "Continue warfarin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Since the patient has increased thromboembolic risk (stroke), warfarin is stopped 4-5 days pre-operatively and LMWH (low molecular weight heparin) is used till the day before (24 hours) surgery. In patients at high risk for thrombosis (e.g., those with certain mechanical heart valve implants or with atrial fibrillation and a prior thromboembolic stroke), warfarin should be stopped and replaced by UFH or LMWH to minimize the risk. Patients at lower risk for thrombosis may have warfarin discontinued 4-5 days preoperatively and then reinitiated after successful surgery.
