It is preferred for use in adults. The Miller straight laryngoscopic blade is used in neonates, infants, and young children, and in adults with a short thyromental distance and long, floppy epiglottis. The advantage of a curved Macintosh blade is that there would be greater room available for the passage of an endotracheal tube and significantly less damage to the teeth.",

The most commonly used laryngoscopic blade for endotracheal intubation in infants and young children is Miller's laryngoscopic blade. However, Macintosh laryngoscopic blade is also commonly used and can be preferred in certain situations. Macintosh blade is typically used for children over 3 years old, making option C a viable choice for a 6-year-old.

Armored tubes (a.k.a. reinforced tubes, flexo-metallic tubes) are flexible, spiral wound tubes that are reinforced with metal coils. This minimizes kinking of the tube. They are useful in surgeries of the head and neck and surgeries performed with the patient in the prone position. Armored or Flexo-metallic endotracheal tube: Armored endotracheal tube. Other specialized endotracheal tubes include: Microlaryngeal tubes: have smaller internal diameters and longer lengths, which makes them useful for laryngeal surgeries.

The advantage of a high-volume, low-pressure cuff is a lesser incidence of tracheal mucosal damage. Disadvantages of a high-volume, low-pressure cuff include: sore throat (due to a larger mucosal contact area), aspiration, spontaneous extubation, and difficulty in insertion (because of the floppy cuff). Types of endotracheal tube cuffs include high volume, low pressure cuff (preferred), which results in less tracheal mucosal injury, and low volume, high pressure cuff (not preferred), which results in high tracheal mucosal injury.",

Note: In this case, invasive airways such as needle cricothyrotomy and percutaneous transtracheal jet ventilation are preferred to secure the airway when the obstruction is above the level of the vocal cords.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Rapid sequence intubation for a patient with a hiatus hernia should be facilitated by the use of a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant such as rocuronium, to prevent an increase in the intragastric pressure (IGP). Succinylcholine is usually the muscle relaxant of choice for RSI since it has a rapid onset and short duration of action. However, regurgitation and aspiration of gastric contents are likely, due to fasciculations of the abdominal skeletal muscles. Hence, endotracheal intubation may be facilitated with rocuronium before succinylcholine to decrease this risk. Generally, an IGP > 28 cm H2O is required to overcome the competence of the gastroesophageal junction. However, when the normal oblique angle of entry of the esophagus into the stomach is altered, the IGP required for regurgitation is much lesser. Conditions that predispose to raised IGP are: • Pregnancy • Ascites • Bowel obstruction • Hiatus hernia",

Option A: Topical cocaine has vasoconstricting properties and hence is ideal for anaesthesia of the nasal mucosa during awake nasotracheal intubation.

An airway cart may include: • Laryngoscope blades of various sizes, including a rigid fibreoptic. • Tracheal tubes of various sizes, and tracheal tube guides such as semirigid stylets, ventilating tube changer, light wands, and forceps that are required to manipulate the distal portion of the tracheal tube. • Masks of various sizes. • Laryngeal mask airways of various sizes. • Flexible fiberoptic intubation equipment. • Retrograde intubation equipment. • At least one device to perform emergency noninvasive airway ventilation such as an esophageal tracheal tube, a hollow jet ventilation stylet. • Equipment required for emergency invasive airway access. • An exhaled CO2 detector.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The image shown is of an armored tube (a.k.a. reinforced, flexo-metallic endotracheal tube). It is useful in head and neck surgeries and when the patient is in a prone position. An armored tube is a flexible, spiral wound tube which is reinforced with a metal coil so as to minimize kinking. The metal coil is better made out in the second image. Other specialized endotracheal tubes include: • South oral Ring Adair Elwin: nasal surgery • Micro laryngeal tubes: laryngeal surgery • Double-lumen endotracheal tubes (Carlen, Robertshaw): thoracic surgery. Note: The tip of the armored endotracheal tube is 2 cm distal to the distal-most metal ring, and this portion may not be visualized in radiography.",
