      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The procedure shown in the above picture is spinal anesthesia. The first case of spinal anesthesia in humans was performed by August Bier in 1898. He performed spinal anesthesia using the local anesthetic cocaine. Spinal anesthesia involves the administration of a local anesthetic into the spinal subarachnoid space to provide motor and sensory blockade. Another contribution by August Bier is 'Bier's block' or IVRA (intravenous regional anesthesia). Spinal Anesthesia Cord Subarachnoid space Epidural space. John Lundy: coined the term balanced anesthesia. Carl Koller: proposed local anesthetic property of cocaine. Oliver Wendell Holmes: coined the term anesthesia.",

      "explanation": "John Lundy coined the term balanced anaesthesia in 1926. He was instrumental in the formation of the American Board of Anesthesiology and chaired the American Medical Association's Section on Anesthesiology for 17 years. Balanced anaesthesia involves the use of multiple anaesthetic agents and techniques to produce the different components of anaesthesia, i.e.: •Analgesia •Amnesia •Muscle relaxation •Abolition of autonomic reflexes. Option B: James Young Simpson introduced chloroform. Option C: Edmund Boyle invented the anaesthetic machine. Option D: Oliver Wendell coined the term anaesthesia",

      "explanation": "October 16th 1846 is significant due to the demonstration of ether anesthesia by William ThomasGreen Morton at Ether Dome at Massachusetts General Hospital.The first public demonstration of surgical anesthesia:10On this day, W.T.G.

He used the term anesthesia to denote “the state that incorporates amnesia, analgesia, and narcosis to make painless surgery possible.” The term anesthesia refers to 'no senses.'

      "explanation": "William Morton is considered the father of modern anesthesia for his public demonstration of ether anesthesia. John Snow administered chloroform to Queen Victoria at the birth of her eighth son, Leopold, in 1853, and performed the same procedure when her daughter Beatrice was born in April 1857. John Snow is considered one of the founders of epidemiology for his work identifying the source of a cholera outbreak in 1854. He was a firm believer in the 'germ' theory of disease, which was not widely accepted until the 1860s. Broadwick Street shows the John Snow memorial and public house; John Snow had the handle of the pump removed following a cholera outbreak in August 1854.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Joseph Priestley first synthesized nitrous oxide in 1772. Joseph Priestley, an English chemist, is well known for his experiments and observations on different kinds of air. He is most famously known for the discovery of 'dephlogisticated air,' which was later named oxygen by Lavoisier. Humphry Davy, in 1800, first noted the analgesic properties of nitrous oxide. Horace Wells studied the analgesic properties of nitrous oxide and put it into clinical use in 1844 for dental extraction, but it was less potent than ether. William Morton introduced ether anesthesia.",

        "C": "Belgium",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Passive euthanasia is legal in India, since 9 March 2018. Prior to this, it was legal only in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Euthanasia involves the administration of medication by someone other than the patient for the purpose of ending the patient's life in the belief that it is best for the patient (but not necessarily at the specific request of the patient). Involuntary euthanasia, which is done against the patient's consent, is illegal in all countries and amounts to murder. Types of euthanasia: • Active euthanasia: Direct administration of a lethal substance to the patient by another party with merciful intent • Passive euthanasia: Withholding or withdrawing of life-sustaining treatment either at the request of the patient or when prolonging life is considered futile • Indirect euthanasia: Prescription of painkillers that may be fatal in an attempt to relieve suffering • Physician-assisted suicide: A medical professional aiding a patient in terminating their life upon the patient's request.",
