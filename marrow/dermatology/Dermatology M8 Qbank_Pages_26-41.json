      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The above image shows intercellular edema involving the stratum spinosum, which is suggestive of spongiosis. Spongiosis is the characteristic histopathological feature of acute eczema. In contrast, ballooning degeneration is a term that refers to the intracellular edema occurring in the stratum spinosum. This results in acantholysis. Ballooning degeneration is often seen secondary to viral infections like herpes. The image below shows ballooning degeneration (intracellular edema is seen).",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Microabscess is not typical of lichenoid tissue reactions. Skin changes in lichenoid tissue reactions: Upper dermis - band-like infiltrate of mononuclear cells. Dermoepidermal junction - saw-toothed pattern. Basal cell layer - liquefaction degeneration, colloid body formation. Epidermis: increase in thickness. Lichenoid reactions are seen in: Lichen planus, Lupus erythematosus, Lichen sclerosis, Poikilodermas, Cutaneous drug eruptions.",

      "question": "A 29-year-old man presented with purple, pruritic plaques on the flexor aspect of the left forearm for 7 months. A history suggestive of Koebner's phenomenon was elicited. A skin biopsy done is shown below. Identify the structure marked.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given scenario with symptoms of purple, itchy plaques exhibiting Koebner's phenomenon is suggestive of lichen planus. It is characterized by the presence of Civatte bodies or colloid bodies as seen in the image above. The colloid body is a homogeneous, eosinophilic, rounded body resulting from the degeneration and death of keratinocytes, particularly in the lower layers of the epidermis. This structure is found in various lichenoid tissue reactions. Option A: Copper penny bodies are seen in chromoblastomycosis. Option C: Donovan bodies are seen in granuloma inguinale. Option D: Kamino bodies are eosinophilic globules seen in the epidermis or in the region of the dermal-epidermal junction in the spindle and epithelioid cell (Spitz) naevi.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Acantholysis is not seen in bullous pemphigoid as it is associated with subepidermal blistering. Acantholysis is the loss of intercellular connections, such as desmosomes, resulting in the loss of cohesion between keratinocytes. Acantholysis is classified as: The image below shows acantholysis (note the rounded and free-floating, detached keratinocytes). Primary: Rupture of the desmosome first, forming circular acantholytic cells. Seen in: Pemphigus vulgaris, Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, Darier's disease, Hailey-Hailey disease. Secondary: Ballooning of the keratinocyte first, forming circular acantholytic cells (Tzank cell). Seen in: Herpes simplex infections (HSV-1 and 2), Varicella-zoster infections (chickenpox, shingles). Acantholysis: Loss of intercellular connections resulting in free-floating, detached keratinocytes.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Acanthosis is characterized by the increase in the number of cells of the stratum spinosum leading to its increased thickness. Acanthosis is commonly accompanied by other histological changes such as hypergranulosis, hyperkeratosis, and papillomatosis. It is seen in verruca vulgaris, chronic eczema, lupus vulgaris. Kindly note that this should not be confused with the term acantholysis. Acantholysis refers to the loss of cohesion between keratinocytes due to the breakdown of intercellular bridges formed by desmosomes. This can be seen in various pemphigus-related disorders and secondary to bullous impetigo and other infections. The image below shows acanthosis. Notice the increased thickness of the Malpighian layer and the elongated rete ridges. Interdigitating papillary dermis, Thickened epidermis, Elongated expanded rete ridges.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The above image showing abnormal epidermal cell keratinization suggestive of dyskeratosis, along with the clinical presentation, points to a likely diagnosis of Bowen's disease. Dyskeratosis is characterized by nuclear pyknosis and condensation of the cytoplasm of keratinocytes. This can occur in: • Malignant lesions - squamous cell carcinoma • Premalignant lesions: • Bowen's disease • Paget's disease • Solar keratosis • Benign conditions: • Darier disease • Hailey-Hailey disease",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Neutrophilic micro-abscesses are seen in psoriasis. A microabscess is a small cavity in the epidermis or dermis formed by collections of leukocytes. Some types of microabscesses and their examples are given below: Predominant cell - Neutrophilic microabscess, Lymphocytic microabscess, Eosinophilic microabscess. Name of microabscess - Papillary tip microabscess, Munroe's microabscess (superficial), Spongiform pustules of Kogoj (deep), Pautrier's microabscess.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "In the given image, the arrow points to a small collection of cells seen within the stratum corneum in a patient with psoriasis. This is suggestive of a Munro's microabscess. Munro's microabscesses are small collections of neutrophil polymorphs. Hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis are also seen here. The spongiform pustule of Kogoj refers to the multilocular micropustules that form in the spinous layer of the epidermis in pustular psoriasis. Predominant cell: Neutrophilic microabscess - Munro's microabscess (superficial), Lymphocytic microabscess - Pautrier's microabscess, Eosinophilic microabscess - Papillary tip microabscess.
