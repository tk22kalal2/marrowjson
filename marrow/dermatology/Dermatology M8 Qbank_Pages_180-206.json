It refers to intercellularepidermal edema that leads to stretching and rupture of the intercellular attachments, with theformation of vesicles.191Eczema is inflammation of the skin seen in a variety of skin conditions.

It is seenin the age group of 3-16 years.Lesions have scaling and are usually not well marginated. In children, the lesions are oftenconfined to the face and are most common on the cheeks and around the mouth and chin.It is often a manifestation of atopic eczema but it is not confined to atopic individuals.Pityriasis albaOption A: In leprosy, the hypopigmented patch is often associated with atrophy, loss of sensation,and loss of sweating. The lesion is not scaly.194Option B: In pityriasis versicolor the hypopigmented macules are perifollicular indistribution. Fine, powdery branny scaling is present. Scratch sign positive.

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario depicting pruritic lesions at a flexural site along with a family history ofatopy (asthma) is suggestive of atopic dermatitis (AD) or atopic eczema (AE). The scratchmarks and excoriations shown in the image are due to pruritis, which is the hallmark feature ofAD.AD is a chronic relapsing inflammatory condition. It presents with erythematous macules,papules and vesicles that often start in early childhood, usually less than 2 years old. The lesionslater become excoriated and lichenified. It is frequently associated with dryness of the skinand secondary infections. In infancy, the lesions initially appear on face (sparing the napkin area)and later on extensor aspect of knees and elbows as the child starts crawling. In later childhoodand in adults, the principal site of involvement is flexures.The filaggrin monomers in keratinocytes in the epidermis bind and aggregate keratin bundles andintermediate filaments to form the epidermal barrier. Any damage/dysfunction of this barrier isassociated with an increased risk of developing AD. Damage to this barrier can be due toenvironmental factors (detergents, hard water, UV light) or local inflammatoryreactions. Dysfunction of the barrier can be due to genetic mutation of the FLG gene leading toreduced filaggrin production or local immunomodulatory effects leading to reduced filaggrinexpression.Other options:Option A: Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized byerythema, pruritus, scaling, flaking, or crusting of the skin. It is often associated with Malasezziafungal infection. A milder form of seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp is commonly known asdandruff.195Option C: Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is an inflammatory condition caused due to a delayedhypersensitivity reaction (Type 4 hypersensitivity) to a specific allergen that comes into directcontact with the skin. Patients usually present with pruritus, erythema, swelling,papules, and papulovesicles. Some common allergens include nickel (found in artificial jewelry),PPD/Para phenylene diamine (in hair dye), chromate (in cement), rubber or latex, cosmetics, etc.Patch test (image below) is used for the diagnosis of ACD.Option D: Erysipelas is a bacterial skin infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (Group AStreptococcus) characterized by raised, erythematous sharply demarcated rapidly spreading skinlesions, along with systemic symptoms like fever and chills. The skin may also have a peaud'orange or orange peel-like appearance.196",

      "explanation": "The given history points towards the diagnosis of photoallergic contact dermatitis. Photopatch testis used to diagnose this condition.It is a delayed-type IV hypersensitivity reaction with a predilection for photo exposed sites withwell demarcated margins where the skin is covered by clothing (at the collar and 'V' of the neck,on the backs of the hands, and on the ankles). It spares the skin behind the earlobe (Wilkinson'striangle) since it is a photo-protected site.Photopatch test: The standard patch test units are applied in two sets (on either side of the spine)and kept covered. One set of patches is removed and exposed to UVA. After irradiation, the otherset of patches are also removed and both the sites are covered again for 48 hours. A positivereaction on the irradiated side only is an indication of photoallergyThe image below shows a photopatch test showing reaction after exposure to UVA only.TBCcontrolUVAUVB204",
