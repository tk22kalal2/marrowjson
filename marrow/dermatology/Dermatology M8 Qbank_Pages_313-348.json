      "explanation": "The given scenario points to a diagnosis of erythema nodosum leprosum or type 2 lepra reaction.The drug of choice is oral corticosteroids.Clofazimine is indicated in chronic ENL, which is steroid-refractory or when steroids arecontraindicated.Thalidomide is superior to steroids in controlling ENL and can be used for severe ENL in youngmen. However, it is generally avoided in women due to its devastating teratogenic side effects. Itmay be considered in severe ENL but must be used cautiously, with double contraceptionmeasures. It also causes peripheral neuropathy and, hence, would be avoided in this patient withlepromatous neuropathy. The high cost and restricted availability also limit the use of this drug.Rifampicin should be avoided as it is highly bactericidal. The massive release of bacterial antigensmay aggravate the lepra reaction.",

      "explanation": "The given scenario of painful nodules in a woman with leprosy is suggestive of erythema nodosumleprosum (ENL). The likely drug used in this immunosuppressed young woman is clofazimine,which causes deposition of crystals in the intestinal mucosa, liver, lymph nodes, and spleen, notrenal tubules.Clofazimine is a brick red, fat soluble crystalline dye with a weak bactericidal action against M.leprae through an unknown mechanism. It also has an anti■inflammatory effect, which is usefulin the management of ENL reactions.340The most noticeable side effect is skin discoloration, ranging from red to purple-black, the degreeof discoloration depends on the dose and amount of leprous infiltration. It generally fades within6-12 months after stopping clofazimine, however, traces of discoloration may remain even for upto 4 years. Urine, sputum, and sweat may turn pink.It also produces scaling and ichthyosis of the shin and forearms.Crystal deposition in the wall of the small bowel occurs as the drug is excreted into the bile. Thiscauses GI side effects that range from mild cramps to diarrhea and weight loss.Note: Corticosteroids are the first-line drugs in the treatment of ENL but would be avoided in thisimmunosuppressed patient.",
