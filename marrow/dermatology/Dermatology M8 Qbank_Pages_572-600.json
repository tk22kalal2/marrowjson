      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Sclerodactyly and Raynauds phenomenon are seen in scleroderma (not scleredema).The symptoms of scleredema are due to a thickened dermis, deposition of mucin, andreplacement of subcutaneous fat with coarse collagen fibers.The dermis is 3-4 times thicker than normal due to an increase of type 1 collagen synthesis bydysfunctional fibroblast. However, fibroblast proliferation is not seen. Erythema and a peaud'orange appearance of the skin are commonly observed. The hands and feet are characteristicallyspared.Diabetic scleredema is the most common type. Here, the accumulation of collagen may be due toirreversible non enzymatic glycosylation of collagen and resistance to degradation bycollagenase. It can also occur post-streptococcal infections.The image shows scleredema in a diabetic patient with firm non■pitting edema and induration onthe upper back, neck, and shoulders on an erythematous background.586",

Thisclinical presentation in a diabetic patient is indicative of necrobiosis lipoidica.Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is a rare chronic and granulomatous skin disorder that affectsonly 0.3% of diabetic patients. The average age of onset is 30 years, with females being affectedmore commonly. Its postulated etiology is microangiopathy.Most rashes are located on the legs, especially above the tibiae. It may present as red papules thatenlarge to form patches or plaques with an atrophic yellowish-brown and slightly depressedcenter. The lesions may resolve spontaneously or become persistent chronic lesions, that canulcerate.Option A: Granuloma annular is most commonly found in children and females &lt;30 years. Itmanifests as groups of 1-2mm papules that range from skin colored to violaceous, in an annulararrangement over distal extremities. There is no confirmed association with diabetes.Option C: Reactive perforating collagenosis (folliculitis) has been reported in patients withdiabetes. It is attributed to collagen glycation.Option D: Rubeosis is a peculiar rosy reddening of the face, and sometimes hands and feet.

      "explanation": "Lupus pernio (cutaneous sarcoidosis) is the most likely diagnosis.Cutaneous sarcoidosis or presents as red brown or red violaceous nodules or plaques, generallymultiple. It is usually asymptomatic. Diascopy reveals the subtle brown yellow or 'apple jelly'color characteristic of granulomatous diseases but usually more opaque than in lupus vulgaris. Atdiagnosis, at least 60% of patients have an increased serum angiotensin converting enzyme level.Lupus pernio is the most distinctive manifestation of cutaneous sarcoidosis. Infiltratederythematoviolaceous plaques involve the nose, cheeks, ears, lips, forehead, and fingers. On thecheeks, a prominent telangiectatic component is characteristic. The clinical appearance is due tothe presence of epithelioid cell granulomas in the dermis.Lupus pernio is usually painless and, as it does not tend to ulcerate, is not as mutilating as lupusvulgaris.In more than half of cases, lupus pernio is associated with sarcoidosis of the upperrespiratory tract, especially in patients with involvement of the nasal rims.It is also frequently associated with pulmonary fibrosis, chronic uveitis, and bony cysts,particularly affecting the terminal phalanges.",

The characteristic triad association of erythema nodosum with bilateral hilar and rightparatracheal adenopathies, with or without pulmonary infiltrates, and polyarthritis is known asLöfgren syndrome. (it is a type of acute sarcoidosis).Arthritis in sarcoidosis is usually symmetrical; the ankles (&gt;90% cases), knees, small joints ofthe hands or feet, wrists, and elbows are involved.Erythema nodosum is the most common non specific lesion of sarcoidosis and the firstmanifestation of the disease but may not be present in all patients.

      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). It is an autoinflammatorydisease (excessive response to an internal antigen) due to neutrophil dysfunction and henceantibiotics have no role in its management.It commonly presents on the anterior aspect of the lower limbs. The disease starts as apapule/pustule/bulla and rapidly progresses to an ulcerative lesion. The undermined edges of theulcer show neutrophilic infiltration. Deep ulcers heal with a characteristic cribriform or criss-crosspattern of scarring.The pustular form of PG is associated mainly with inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis&gt; Crohn's disease), the bullous form with hematological malignancies.Pathergy is the phenomenon whereby skin trauma provokes lesions at the site of injury. It is seenin pyoderma gangrenosum, Behcet's disease.The image below shows a large purulent ulcer with violaceous undermined borders which is afeature of pyoderma gangrenosum.595",

      "explanation": "Neutrophilic infiltration of the dermis indicates one of the diseases under neutrophilicdermatosis. Sweet's Syndrome presents as an acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis whichis characterized by non itchy, sometimes tender, erythematous plaques and papules.The plaques are often oedematous and as the process develops they may become studded withpseudovesicles or pseudopustules (no fluid collection present).The lesions in Sweet's Syndrome are most commonly distributed on the arms, upper body, head,and neck. An associated fever and peripheral leucocytosis are commonly seen and females aremore frequently affected.Histological findings include a dense dermal neutrophilic infiltrate with edema. Three subgroupsare recognized:• Classical• Malignancy-associated.• Drug-inducedOption A: Behcet's syndrome is also a neutrophilic dermatosis but presents as recurrent oral andgenital aphthous ulcers with an erythematous halo.Option B: Pyoderma gangrenosum, another neutrophilic dermatosis presents as painful ulcerativeerythematous plaques or papules with undermined violaceous borders.Option C: Kasabach-Merritt's syndrome shows hemangiomas with thrombocytopenia.The image given below shows Sweet syndrome- pseudovesicles may occur within theinflammatory plaques.596abC",

Theunderlying mechanism is thought to be an inflammatory process. They can be:• Idiopathic, due to exposure to cold that present within 12-24 hours.•Secondary to hematological disorder (paraproteinemia), autoimmune disease, viral hepatitis ormalignancy.The latest guidelines suggest patients presenting with new-onset, pernio-like lesions that have noother clear cause should be tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There are no treatment guidelines forCOVID-19-associated, pernio-like lesions of the feet or hands. However, high-potency topicalcorticosteroids may be helpful if the lesions are causing discomfort.",
