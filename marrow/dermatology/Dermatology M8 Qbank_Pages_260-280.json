When the scales are completely scraped off, the basement membrane isexposed and is seen as a moist red surface (membrane of Bulkeley) through which dilatedcapillaries at the tip of elongated dermal papillae are torn, leading to multiple bleeding points.This classical pinpoint bleeding is known as the Auspitz sign.Auspitz sign is due to the elongated, dilated, tortuous vessels in the dermal papilla alongwith supra papillary thinning of the epidermis.However, the Auspitz sign is neither sensitive nor specific for psoriasis.Auspitz sign presenAuspitz sign absenttPsoriasis vulgarisPustular psoriasisDarrier's diseaseGuttate psoriasisActinic keratosisInverse psoriasisErythrodermic psoriasiS",
