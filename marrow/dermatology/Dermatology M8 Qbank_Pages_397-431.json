The drug of choicefor this condition is miltefosine.Approach to the case:The patient hails from a kala-azar endemic zone-Bihar. The rash appears 1-2 years after a historyof prolonged fever, which suggests visceral leishmaniasis. There are 2 other differentials-leprosyand tinea versicolor.• The presence of hypopigmented macules over the trunk and face, suggests a differential ofleprosy, but the nerves and sensations are normal, hence ruling it out.•There is no scaling visible in the lesions, ruling out tinea versicolor.In kala-azar, after a variable period of years or months, diffuse nodulation begins to develop inthese macules. The rash is progressive over many years and seldom heals spontaneously. As itmay persist for up to 20 years, these patients may act as a chronic reservoir of infection.The image below shows post-kala-azar cutaneous leishmaniasis.430Post-kala-azar Cutaneous Leishmaniasis431",
