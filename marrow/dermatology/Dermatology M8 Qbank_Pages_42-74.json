All of these are primary skin lesions. A macule is a flat area of color change, less than 1 cm, also called a primary lesion or patch. A nodule is an elevated lesion extending into the dermis or subcutis. A plaque is an elevated, flat lesion. A papule is an elevated lesion. A tumor is a swelling or mass greater than 1 cm. A wheal is a transient elevation due to dermal and hypodermal edema. A vesicle or bulla is a fluid-filled lesion. A pustule is a vesicle that contains pus. Secondary lesions include scales, which are flat plates or flakes of stratum corneum; crust, which is dried serum and exudates; fissure, a linear gap in the skin; ulcer, which is a loss of epidermis and dermis, as well as underlying tissue; scar, which is a replacement by fibrous tissue after injury; and atrophy, which is a loss of tissue.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "This clinical scenario is suggestive of obstructive jaundice, which is associated with severe itching. Hence, you would expect to see excoriations or scratch marks. The pruritis occurring in obstructive jaundice is due to cholestasis. The bile salts deposit in the skin, causing saponification of the fat surrounding the nerve endings. This leaves the nerves exposed, producing the sensation of a severe itch. It involves loss of skin substance till the level of the epidermis or upper dermis. Almost all pruritic conditions (except lichen planus) cause excoriation.",

It develops at 3-12 months of life and presents with generalized, itchy, small, light-grey scales and xerosis that are more marked over extensor surfaces and trunk. The groin and flexures are spared. X-linked recessive ichthyosis occurs only in males. It results in larger, dirty-brown scales.",

It is caused by the larvae of various hookworm or Ancylostoma species. The parasite is acquired from direct skin contact with soil contaminated by dog or cat feces. It is common following travel to endemic or tropical areas, and symptoms develop within the first 2 weeks. The site of entry is marked by an inflamed papule, often located between the toes. Serpentine or linear single-track lines later appear as the larvae migrate through the epidermis. The lesions can enlarge as much as 1 to 2 cm per day. The first-line treatment is oral ivermectin at 200 µg/kg. Oral albendazole is an alternative treatment. Note: Larva currens is caused by the migrating larva of Strongyloides stercoralis. It also produces serpiginous lesions and can be differentiated by the faster rate of progression and haphazard distribution of lesions.",

They appear as bluish, milky, or ivory white patches with sharp margins. Wood's lamp is hence helpful in the diagnosis of vitiligo, especially in fair-skinned people in whom lesions may not be obvious to the naked eye.

Disease: Pemphigus, Hailey-Hailey disease; Toxic epidermal necrolysis; Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, Bullous impetigo; Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2; Herpes zoster; Molluscum contagiosum; Leishmaniasis; Basal cell carcinoma.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The test depicted in the given image is diascopy. It involves pressing a glass slide or a stiff, clear, colorless piece of plastic onto the skin to cause blanching by compressing blood out of small vessels. This allows other colors to be evaluated. Some uses of diascopy are as follows: • Spider naevi - Compression of radiating arterioles is noted. • Apple jelly nodules - Yellow-brown lesions seen in lupus vulgaris and sarcoidosis. • Differentiation of erythema (disappears) and purpura (remains unaltered). The image given below shows apple-jelly nodules on diascopy.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "10% neutral buffered formalin is the most widely used fixative for routine diagnostic microscopy of paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Skin biopsies are indicated in various conditions like epidermal or dermal neoplasms as well as blistering disorders for immunofluorescence. Michel's medium is used as a transport medium. Various techniques of skin biopsy are available based on the lesions to be biopsied: Technique - Excision, Incision biopsy (wedge), Punch biopsy (3-6 mm), Curettage, Shave biopsy, Snip. Application - For removal of a single, small lesion. An elliptical or fusiform-shaped area of skin is removed. A part of a large lesion is removed, with some normal peri-lesional skin for comparison. Useful for accurate sampling of limited tissue. For hyperkeratotic lesions like seborrheic keratoses, viral warts, basal cell carcinomas. It is usually accompanied by cauterization. For protuberant lesions on the face like benign intradermal naevi. For skin tags.",

Skin scrapings from the lesions are mounted in 10-30% potassium hydroxide. A higher percentage of KOH solution speeds up the process. It is then observed under fluorescence microscopy using a fluorescent brightener like Calcofluor white or Blankophor, which specifically stains polysaccharides in the fungal cell wall. The hyphae and spherical Malassezia yeasts are called spaghetti and meatballs or bananas and grapes appearance.",

      "explanation": "The given image shows a photo-patch test. Skin reaction is seen on the uncovered side that is exposed to UV rays. Photo-patch test is useful in the diagnosis of photosensitive rashes and photoallergic contact dermatitis that are typically localized to the sun-exposed areas of the skin. UV light is used at a dose sufficient to trigger the photoallergic response, without causing a false positive phototoxic reaction. It is performed like a conventional patch test, except two sets of allergens are applied over the back. The control set of allergens and the rest of the skin are covered with an opaque material. The patient is positioned 15 cm from a UV lamp and the test site is irradiated with UV light. This test is best read after 48 hours. In the case of a positive test indicating photoallergy, the exposed side shows a reaction.",
