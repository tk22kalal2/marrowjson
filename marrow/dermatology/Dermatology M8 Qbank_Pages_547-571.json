      "explanation": "The above image shows a flat, brownish, irregularly shaped lesion suggestive of melanoma. Thecyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor 2A gene (CDKN2A), located on chromosome 9p21, is thebest established high risk locus for melanoma susceptibility.CDKN2A mutations are found in approximately 40% of individuals with familial melanoma.In melanoma, tumor suppressors that play a protective role against melanoma are mutated.CDKN2A encodes via alternative splicing for two proteins involved in cell cycle regulation:569p16/Ink4a and p14/Arf, both act as tumor suppressors through the Rb and p53 cancer pathways,respectively.",

Trichoblastoma is a tumor of the germ cells of the hair follicle andcommonly develops within naevus sebaceous.Cylindroma is familial, inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder, due to the loss of thecylindromatosis gene, CYLD on chromosome 16q12-13, and have been reported to followradiotherapy epilation of the scalp.570The lesions are frequently multiple, smooth, firm, pink to red, and somewhat pedunculated. Theyare mostly seen on the scalp.
