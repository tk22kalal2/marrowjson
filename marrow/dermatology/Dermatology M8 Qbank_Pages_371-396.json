The incubation period is around 14 days-6 months. It ismainly caused by type-I molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV-1) in children and type-II (MCV 2)in adults and HIV patients. New lesions develop along the line of trauma (pseudo-Koebnerphenomenon). Sexually transmitted molluscum contagiosum may be present over the genital area.Microscopic examination of the lesions shows eosinophilic inclusions called Henderson-Pattersonbodies.The condition is usually self-limiting but treatment is required for non-resolving symptomaticlesions. Destruction with cantharidin, trichloroacetic acid, diluted liquefied phenol, or surgicalremoval are a few options.384Molluscum contagiosumEnlarged keratinocytes of stratum malpighii with eosinophilicinclusion bodies - Henderson-Patterson bodies or molluscumbodies containing virus particles",

      "explanation": "The above scenario is suggestive of active primary genital herpes in the mother. In the case ofneonatal transmission, the mortality is high.Herpes simplex infection of a baby within 28 days of birth is called neonatal herpes. HSV-2 ismore commonly implicated than HSV-1. It is usually acquired vertically from the mother orpostnatally by contact with non genital sites.Features of neonatal herpes:• Vesicular eruption•• Inflamed and ulcerated mucosae• Disseminated disease:• Lethargy• Seizures•Respiratory distress••Hepatosplenomegaly with hepatitis⚫ Thrombocytopenia.Primary genital herpes infection in the mother at the time of delivery is associated with a high riskof transmission to the baby during vaginal delivery. Hence cesarean section is indicated andprophylactic aciclovir should be considered for the neonate.Neonatal herpes is treated with high dose intravenous acyclovir followed by oral acyclovir for 6months.386The image below shows neonatal herpes.

The lesionsdevelop in 3-5 crops and are polymorphic (present at different stages in each site). In 2–4 days,dry crust forms leaving a shallow pink depression which, in the absence of secondary infection,heals without scarring.Most common complication is secondary bacterial infection.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The above image shows unilateral, painful, grouped vesicles in a single dermatome suggestive ofherpes zoster or shingles. The mucous membranes within the affected dermatomes are involved inshingles.Herpes zoster/shingles is an acute cutaneous segmental eruption due to the reactivation of latentvaricella-zoster virus from dorsal root ganglia. An earlier infection with varicella is essentialbefore zoster can occur.The first symptom of zoster is usually pain, 1-3 days after which the lesions appear. Occasionally,the pain may not be followed by the eruption (‘zoster sine eruptione'). The patients are infectious,both from the virus in the lesions and nasopharynx.The most commonly involved dermatomes in decreasing order of frequency are thoracic &gt;cervical &gt; trigeminal &gt; lumbosacral. The incidence of ophthalmic zoster increase with age.The posterior nerve roots and ganglia show inflammatory changes.Herpes zoster ophthalmicus is a variant of zoster involving the ophthalmic division of thetrigeminal nerve (V1). Herpes zoster oticus/Ramsay Hunt syndrome is another variant involvingthe geniculate ganglion and presents with ipsilateral facial nerve palsy, otalgia and vesicles overexternal ear.Zoster is a self-limiting infection but it is painful and carries a risk of secondary infection andpost-herpetic neuralgia. Analgesia and treatment of secondary infections are sufficient for mildinfections.Indications for antivirals in VZV (Acyclovir 800 mg):• Painful zoster infections in adults• Facial zoster at any age• Immunocompromised",

Itis generally defined as persistence or recurrence of pain more than 1-3 months after the onset ofzoster. The pain may be a continuous burning pain with hyperaesthesia or a spasmodic shootingtype or pruritic paraesthesia may also occur. Allodynia (pain caused by normally innocuousstimuli) is often the most distressing symptom and occurs in most people with post herpeticneuralgia.A tricyclic antidepressant such as amitriptyline or nortriptyline is useful for hyperaesthesia andconstant burning pain.",
