It occurs due to an increased number of mast cells in the skin.The mast cells accumulate in tissues due to a gain-of function mutation of KIT.

The age of onset is in the first year in thechildhood type and 20-40 years in the adult type.It presents with numerous reddish brown or pale monomorphic maculopapules, plaques, ornodules in a symmetrical distribution.

It can present withor without wheals.Quincke's disease refers to the hereditary form of angioedema without wheals. There is no itching.It is bradykinin-mediated and is usually linked to abnormality or deficiency of C1 esteraseinhibitor (C1INH) enzyme.

      "explanation": "The image shows subcutaneous and submucosal edema of the face and lips without wheals. Alongwith the history, a diagnosis of hereditary angioedema (HAE) is most likely. Type I HAE is themost common form (85%).There are three types of hereditary angioedema (HAE):•• Type 1 (85%): C1INH deficiency• Type 2 (15%): Dysfunction of C1-INH, but normal levels• Type 3 (rare): Normal C1-INH levels and functionHAE occurs due to a mutation in the SERPING1 gene, which codes for the C1 esterase inhibitor(C1INH). It is also called angioneurotic edema or Quincke's disease.C1INH enzyme normally inhibits the following:•Complement system• Kallikrein system●• Factor XII or Hageman factorIn HAE, loss of C1INH activity leads to loss of inhibition of these above processes. This leads todecreased C4 and C2 levels and bradykinin accumulation.",
