      "explanation": "Erythema multiforme minor (papular or simplex form) accounts for approximately 80% of casesand is the most common form.Clinically erythema multiforme presents as macular, papular, or urticarial lesions, as well as theclassic iris or 'target lesions', distributed preferentially on the distal extremities. Raised atypicaltarget lesions having only two of the zones may also be seen and mucous membranes are rarelyinvolved. Koebnerization accounts for some bizarre clinical distributions.Photoaggravation of erythema multiforme is well recognized.The lesions appear in successive crops for a few days and fade in 1-2 weeks, sometimes leavingdusky discoloration.The image given below shows mucosal involvement in erythema multiforme major229",

NSAIDs are the most commonly implicated drug.Fixed drug eruption (FDE) is a cutaneous adverse drug reaction characterized by recurrentwell defined lesions occurring at the same sites each time the offending drug is taken. It typicallypresents 30 min to 8 h after drug exposure.The most common drugs that act as triggers are:•• NSAIDs (25%)• Paracetamol (15%)• Cotrimoxazole•TetracyclinesFDE is a form of classical delayed type hypersensitivity reaction.Typically, FDE presents as a sharply defined, round, or oval erythematous and oedematousplaque, which evolves to become dusky, violaceous, and occasionally vesicular or bullous lesions.Lesions are usually solitary or few in number.Commonly affected sites include the lips, genitals, palms, and soles; 5% of cases may have anexclusive mucosal involvement. Overall, the most common site involved is the genitalia.The majority of FDE is self limiting with an excellent prognosis.234Note: The generalized bullous form of FDE should be differentiated from toxic epidermalnecrolysis by prior similar history, absence of target lesions, and no involvement of mucosalsurfaces.",
