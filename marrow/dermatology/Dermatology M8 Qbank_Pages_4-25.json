In preterm infants, the stratum corneum is permeable and becomes similar to that of the adult and full-term infant after 2-3 weeks of postnatal maturation. The development of the layers of the epidermis starts from below upwards. Therefore, the stratum basale is the first to form and the stratum corneum is the last layer to form.",

The thick skin found in the palms and soles has an additional fifth layer, called the stratum lucidum, located between the stratum corneum and stratum granulosum. The epidermis is made of superficial keratinized, stratified, squamous epithelium. The epidermis is a highly cellular layer but is avascular, hence dependent on the underlying dermis for nutrition via diffusion through the dermoepidermal junction.

      "explanation": "The stratum corneum, also known as the horny layer, consists of cells without a nucleus and hence does not divide. It prevents the entry of microbes from the environment into the body and prevents leakage of fluids from the body to the environment. This is called the barrier function. As keratinocytes divide and move up to the stratum corneum from stratum basale, they undergo the following changes: • Loss of nucleus and ability to divide • Increase in size • Change in shape and flattening • Dehydration and loss of water • Loss of metabolic activity. Note: In palmoplantar skin, there is an additional zone, also electron lucent, the stratum lucidum, which lies between the granulosum and corneum. These cells are still nucleated and may be referred to as transitional cells.",

They follow a 'V' shape over the upper spine, 'S-shaped' whirls over the lower abdomen and sides, inverted U-shape from the breast area onto the upper arm, and wavy shapes on the head. The stripes are a type of genetic mosaicism. Blaschko's lines - lines of normal skin development. Inverted U shape over breast, S shape over lower abdomen and sides, V shape over upper spine. Several other dermatological disorders are known to follow the lines of Blaschko as given in the table: Disorder, Genodermatoses, Examples: Melanotic macules of McCune-Albright syndrome, Focal dermal hypoplasia, Congenital/Nevoid condition, Hypomelanosis of Ito, Nevus de pigmentosus, Linear Darier's disease, Epidermal Naevus, Acquired dermatoses, Segmental vitiligo, Lichen striatus, Linear scleroderma.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The ratio of type-I to type-III collagen in the adult human skin is 8:1. Type-I collagen is the predominant collagen in the human dermis. Type-III collagen is known to predominate in the human skin during embryonic development, but during the early postnatal period, type-I collagen synthesis accelerates. This results in the ratio of type-I to type-III collagen in the adult human skin being approximately 8:1.",

      "question": "What is the type of connective tissue present in the area marked by the arrow in the given image?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Dense regular",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The area marked is the reticular dermis. It is made up of dense irregular connective tissue. It is found in the regions that are under considerable mechanical stress and where protection is given to ensheathed organs. It is usually present in: • Reticular dermis • Superficial connective tissue sheaths of the muscle and nerves • Adventitia of large vessels • Capsules of various organs and glands (e.g., testis, sclera, periosteum, perichondrium) On the other hand, dense regular collagen fibers are found in tendons.",
