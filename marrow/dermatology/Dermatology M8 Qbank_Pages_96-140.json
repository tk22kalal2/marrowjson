      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "80-90% of hair follicles at a given time are in the anagen phase. The hair cycle has three phases: Anagen (growth), Catagen (growth stops), and Telogen (rest). Anagen restarts. Anagen refers to the period of active hair growth. Anagen can continue for several years, and the duration of this phase is responsible for determining the final length of the hair. Normally, 80-90% of hair follicles on the human scalp are in anagen at any one time. It can be identified by the presence of angulated roots. Catagen: At the end of anagen, epithelial cell division slows and stops, and the follicle enters an involutionary phase known as catagen. The proximal end of the hair shaft keratinizes to form a club-shaped structure, and the lower part of the follicle involutes by apoptosis. It lasts for about 3 weeks. Telogen: It is the resting phase between catagen and the next anagen. Clubbing becomes more prominent. It lasts for about 3 months. Club hair is eventually shed through an active process called exogen. In the human scalp, hair follicles may remain in a state of latency, also known as kenogen, for a prolonged period after the club hair is shed.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Vellus hair extends to the dermis and not the subcutis. Lanugo refers to the fine, soft, unmedullated and usually unpigmented hair of the prenatal period. It is normally shed in utero in the eighth to ninth months of gestation. Postnatal hair is of two kinds: vellus and terminal. Vellus Hair: Thin and weak, site: arms, legs, stomach, absent melanin (light colour), medulla: absent, depth: dermis, length: <2 cm. Terminal Hair: Thicker, coarser, stronger, site: scalp, brows, lashes, sexual hair, present melanin (dark colour), medulla: present and thick, depth: subcutis, length: > 2 cm.",

      "question": "A young man comes to you with hair loss as shown in the image given below. You prescribe finasteride to prevent his condition from worsening. Which isoform(s) of 5-alpha reductase does this drug inhibit?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Type 3",
        "B": "Type 2",
        "C": "Types 1 and 2",
        "D": "Types 2 and 3"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "This man has male-pattern hair loss. Finasteride selectively inhibits type 2 5-alpha reductase within the hair follicle. Hence, it is used in the treatment of male-pattern hair loss. The 5-alpha reductase enzyme converts testosterone to the more potent form of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). 5-alpha reductase exists in 3 isoforms. Type 1 and 3 are widely distributed in the skin and not involved in hair growth. Type 2 is present in androgen-responsive tissues such as the dermal papillae of the hair follicle, prostate, epididymides, and seminal vesicles. Type 2 5-alpha reductase also plays a key role in regulating androgen-dependent hair growth. Hair growth in the following areas is androgen dependent: beard, chest, and extremity hair in males; scalp, pubic, and axillary hair in both sexes. Male-pattern hair loss causes thinning of the vertex and an M-shaped receding hairline, as shown below. High levels of circulating androgens stimulate hair loss in certain sites by a process called miniaturization. Finasteride reverses this process.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The dermal papilla is the primary target of the action of androgen in the hair. This is because the dermal papillae have two important features, namely: androgen receptors, which are present only in dermal papillae, and expression of 5-alpha reductase type 2, which regulates androgen-dependent hair growth. Androgens have the following effects on hair growth: it increases the number of cells in the dermal papilla, which causes hair follicle growth and results in pubertal hair growth. It also causes miniaturization of the follicle in other susceptible sites, which leads to male pattern hair loss. Finasteride inhibits the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone in the dermal papillae. This prevents miniaturization and further development of alopecia.",

        "D": "Finasteride is the first-line treatment"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "This clinical scenario is suggestive of male pattern androgenetic alopecia. Finasteride is not the first-line treatment in women. Finasteride use in pregnancy can lead to teratogenic effects on male fetuses. Androgenetic alopecia is a disorder characterized by a reduction of hair fiber production by follicles and miniaturization. It is of two types, male pattern and female pattern hair loss. Male pattern hair loss may occur in females, and vice versa is also true. Male pattern hair loss causes frontal hairline recession and thinning of the vertex. Miniaturization refers to a reduction in the size of follicles until it leaves behind a remnant called stelae or streamers. Elastic staining of the stelae shows Arao-Perkin's bodies. DHT is a more potent form of testosterone. It is responsible for follicular regression and thus causes androgenic alopecia. Finasteride inhibits the enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT and hence is used for treatment. Minoxidil is a potent vasodilator. It is used orally to treat severe hypertension. When used as a hair lotion, it prolongs the anagen phase and slows down or prevents hair loss. Drugs used to treat male pattern baldness: Minoxidil lotion and 5-alpha reductase antagonist - Finasteride. Drugs used to treat female pattern baldness: Minoxidil lotion and anti-androgens - spironolactone, flutamide, and cyproterone acetate.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Female pattern hair loss (FPHL) presents with diffuse thinning of hair over the mid-frontal scalp with minimal or no bitemporal recession. Usually, vertex baldness is absent and the frontal hairline is maintained. Male pattern hair loss (MPHL) involves vertex baldness and frontal hairline recession. There is no entity called mixed pattern hair loss. Currently, the Hamilton-Norwood classification system for MPHL and the Ludwig system for FPHL are most commonly used to describe patterns of hair loss.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Chemotherapy causes hair loss known as anagen effluvium. It is due to the disruption of the anagen or proliferating phase of the hair cycle. Hair shedding typically occurs within 1-3 weeks and it is complete within 1-2 months after the initiation of chemotherapy. Most important drugs implicated in the order of decreasing frequency of association causing anagen effluvium: • Anti-microtubule agents (e.g., paclitaxel) • Topo-isomerase inhibitors (e.g., doxorubicin). Alkylating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide) • Anti-metabolites (e.g., 5-fluorouracil). Option A: Alopecia areata causes patchy, well-circumscribed hair loss. Alopecia Areata. Option B: Telogen effluvium is an acute-onset diffuse hair loss that occurs 2-3 months after a triggering event such as high fever, surgical trauma, sudden starvation or haemorrhage. Option D: Trichotillomania is a behavioural disorder characterised by compulsive hair pulling which causes patchy hair loss. It shares some features with obsessive-compulsive disorder and may be associated with other psychiatric conditions.",

      "explanation": "The pattern of hair loss in this clinical scenario is telogen effluvium. It is an acute-onset scalp hair loss that occurs 2-3 months after a triggering event such as high fever, surgical trauma, sudden starvation, or hemorrhage. It refers to an increase in the shedding of telogen club hairs due to premature termination of the anagen (proliferative) phase of the hair cycle following a period of stress. Chronic diffuse telogen hair loss refers to telogen hair shedding persisting > 6 months. Causes of chronic diffuse telogen hair loss are: thyroid disorders (both hyper- and hypothyroidism), severe iron deficiency anemia, acrodermatitis enteropathica, and malnutrition. Telogen gravidarum refers to telogen hair loss seen 2-3 months after childbirth. The circulating placental estrogen during pregnancy prolongs the anagen phase. After delivery, the estrogen withdrawal pushes all the hair simultaneously into catagen and then telogen phase.",

It is then examined under the microscope for the presence of hyphae. Tinea capitis is a dermatophyte infection primarily occurring in children. Clinical features of tinea capitis are patchy hair loss, scaling, tender lymphadenopathy, and in severe cases, there might be pustules and crusting of the affected area along with sinus formation. The clinical variants of tinea capitis are: Endothrix - a non-inflammatory type in which multiple black dots are present within the areas of alopecia. It is most commonly caused by T. tonsurans and T. violaceum. Ectothrix - a mild inflammatory type in which single or multiple scaly patches with hair loss are seen. Microsporum audouinii, M. canis, M. equinum, and M. ferrugineum cause ectothrix infection. Kerion - a severe inflammatory type that presents with an inflammatory mass with thick crusting and matting of hair with pus and sinus formation. It is commonly caused by T. verrucosum and T. mentagrophytes. Favus - is characterized by the presence of yellowish, cup-shaped crusts known as scutula that develop around hair follicles.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Bamboo hair is seen in Netherton syndrome. It presents with atopy, recurrent skin infection, and an increased risk of skin cancer. It has two characteristic features, namely: • Ichthyosis linearis circumflexa - a rare form of ichthyosis with scaling and plaques. Trichorrhexis invaginata or bamboo hair - characterized by invagination of the distal hair shaft into the proximal portion. It is also called golf-tee or ball and socket appearance as seen below. Option A: Trichorrhexis nodosa is associated with trauma to the hair shaft and arginosuccinic aciduria. It causes node formation and fractures, which results in the thrust paintbrush appearance seen below, as if two paintbrushes are rubbing against each other. Option C: Menkes kinky hair syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder of copper metabolism. It is associated with pili torti or twisted hairs, seen in the first image, and monilethrix or beaded hair, seen in the second image. Option D: Uncombable hair syndrome produces a characteristic triangular cross-section of hair and longitudinal groove along one side, which contributes to its hair stiffness.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "This patient has green nails or chloronychia, a painless condition caused by infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pseudomonas may colonize the nail following onycholysis (painless separation of the nail from the bed) which occurs due to frequent wetting or wearing of gloves causing maceration and minor trauma due to long nails or manicures. The green color is due to pyoverdin and pyocyanin, produced by P. aeruginosa. Though it is harmless for the patient, it may spread to other immunosuppressed individuals. Hence, these patients should not work in hospitals, kitchens, and other places where they are likely to spread the infection to others. Treatment is with fingertip baths in white vinegar, bleach, or topical gentamicin. Option A: Klebsiella colonization can cause greyish discoloration of nails. Option B: Minocycline is one of the most common antibiotics used by dermatologists due to its anti-inflammatory properties. It causes a bluish-grey discoloration of nails.

Trichothiodystrophy is an autosomal recessive condition causing defective DNA repair. It causes brittle sulfur-deficient hair, photosensitivity, ichthyosis, and systemic involvement. Unlike xeroderma pigmentosum (a similar condition with defective DNA repair), there is no risk of skin cancer. Option A: Trichorrhexis nodosa is associated with node formation and fractures. The classic appearance, shown in the image below, is known as a paintbrush appearance, as if two paintbrushes are rubbing against each other. It is associated with trauma to the hair shaft and argininosuccinic aciduria. Option B - Trichorhexis invaginata or bamboo hair is characterized by invagination of the distal hair shaft into the proximal portion. It is seen in Netherton's syndrome. It is also called a golf-tee or ball and socket appearance, as seen below. Option D: Monilethrix, seen in the image below, is characterized by beaded hair and is fragile at the constricted sites.
