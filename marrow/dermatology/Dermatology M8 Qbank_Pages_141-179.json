      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The ratio of the epidermal melanin unit is 36 keratinocytes: 1 melanocyte. The color of the skin is due to the pigment melanin synthesized by melanocytes. Melanocytes are dendritic cells derived from neural crest cells and are present in the epidermis' stratum basale. Each melanocyte synthesizes melanin and packs it in cell organelles to form melanosomes. These melanosomes are transferred through dendritic processes to 36 keratinocytes forming the 'epidermal melanin' unit.",

      "explanation": "White forelock is quite common in piebaldism. Piebaldism is an autosomal dominant benign condition. Mutations are in the c-KIT gene. Well-defined irregular hypopigmented macules with an absence of melanocytes are seen. Leucotrichia is associated with the depigmented macules. Small spots of hyperpigmentation are also seen within hypopigmented patches or on normal skin. It is often associated with a V-shaped leucoderma on the mid-forehead. Epidermal cell or skin grafting is the treatment. Piebaldism can be distinguished from vitiligo because of the neonatal presence of white patches.",

In non-pregnant women, it is calledmelasma.Chloasma is very common in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy and is most marked in brunettes.It is due to increased levels of estrogen and progesterone, stimulating the activity of melanocytes.Histopathology shows no increase in number but hyper-functional melanocytes. It resolves on itsown after pregnancy.Melasma is the most common cause of chronic facial melanosis. It is manifested byhyperpigmented macules that become more pronounced after sun exposure. Hypermelanosisaffects mainly the upper lip, the malar regions, forehead, and chin. It is more common in womenbetween 20-40 years. It is frequently seen in women on oral contraceptives.Wood's lamp examination is useful to differentiate the level of pigmentation andtreatment response:⚫ Epidermal melasma- shows enhanced color contrast•• Dermal melasma- shows less color contrast (more resistant to treatment)• Mixed melasma.Melasma is more chronic and requires treatment with depigmenting agents like:●Kligman's triple combination - topical hydroquinone + tretinoin + corticosteroid compoundcream (first line)• Hydroquinone (reduces tyrosinase activity)• Kojic acid (tyrosinase inhibitor)176• Chemical peels",
