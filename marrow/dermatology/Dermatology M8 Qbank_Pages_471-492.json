      "explanation": "The deformity shown in the above image depicts a penis that is twisted along its long axis, whichis called saxophone penis. It is a late complication of lymphogranuloma venereum, peniletuberculosis, and primary lymphedema. It does not occur in donovanosis.It occurs as a complication of long-standing inflammation, which causes fibrosis of lymphaticsand connective tissue. The dorsal surface of the penis has a poor blood supply compared to theventral surface and undergoes more fibrosis. This leads to a dorsal bend of the penis.Gonococcal urethritis can lead to periurethral abscesses, which result in urethral strictures. Inmales, this may cause a saxophone penis deformity.491",

      "question": "Which of the following is not a feature of the Amsel criteria?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Homogenous thin greyish discharge",
        "B": "Vaginal pH less than 4.5",
        "C": "Amine odour after adding 10% KOH",
        "D": "Epithelial cells studded with coccobacilli"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Acidic pH is not a feature of the Amsel criteria, which are used for the diagnosis of bacterialvaginosis.3 out of 4 of the following criteria are needed for a positive diagnosis:• Homogeneous, thin, grayish-white discharge that smoothly coats the vaginal walls.• Vaginal pH &gt; 4.5.•• Positive whiff-amine test - Fishy odor when a drop of 10% KOH is added to vaginal discharge.Clue cells on saline wet mount: Vaginal epithelial cells studded with adherent coccobacilli at theedge of the cell.Clue cellsBacterial vaginosis is caused by a reduction in lactobacilli, and an increase in anaerobic organismssuch as Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis and Prevotella species.Nugent scoring system is highly sensitive and is considered the gold standard for bacterialvaginosis. It is calculated using Gram-stained smear findings and observing the number oflactobacilli and morphology of anaerobes. High scores of 7–10 indicate bacterial vaginosis.492",
