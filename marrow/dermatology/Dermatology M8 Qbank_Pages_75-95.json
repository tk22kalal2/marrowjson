      "explanation": "A teenager presenting with papulopustular lesions on the face and the presence of comedones is most likely suffering from acne vulgaris. Oily skin due to excessive sebum production is one of the causative factors of acne, but oily food is not directly implicated. Acne results from the combination of: \n      • Increased sebaceous gland activity under the influence of androgens - oily skin\n      • Abnormal follicular differentiation with increased keratinization - hypercornification of duct due to increased IL-1\n      • Microbial hypercolonization of the follicular canal leading to its inflammation.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The presence of multiple nodulocystic lesions implies that this is a case of severe acne. Isotretinoin is the first-line drug for the treatment of severe acne (nodular acne and acne conglobata). Systemic retinoids are highly teratogenic and are absolutely contraindicated in pregnant women, those planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding mothers. Two negative pregnancy tests (on separate occasions) are required for females of childbearing age before starting acitretin or isotretinoin. Baseline evaluation of serum lipids, transaminases, and complete blood counts should be done before starting any systemic retinoids. These values should be checked monthly for the first 3-6 months and once every 3 months thereafter. Monthly pregnancy tests should be done while on the drug. Note: Female patients should avoid conception for 3 years after discontinuing acitretin treatment for cutaneous psoriasis.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The patient comes with erythema and papules on facial convexities (central face), a characteristic feature of acne rosacea. It is triggered by exposure to sunlight, spicy food, alcohol, or emotional disturbances. Patients also develop telangiectasia later. They also have a tendency for developing rapid flushing due to temperature change. Rosacea is more common in women of age 30-50 years. The innate immune response in rosacea appears to be altered. There is increased Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) activity and increased protease activity. Demodex mite proliferation in the pilosebaceous follicles of the face has also been suggested as a possible etiological factor in cutaneous and ocular inflammation. The pathogenesis of ocular rosacea seems to be closely associated with meibomian gland dysfunction. The table below shows the 4 subtypes and the corresponding treatment options. The subtypes are not equivalent to the progression of the disease. The image below shows rosacea. Subtype: Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea (ETTR) Treatment: Sun avoidance and protection, Topical receptor agonists - brimonidine or oxymetazoline. Subtype: Papulopustular rosacea (PPR) Treatment: Active inflammatory lesions: Topical metronidazole, Azelaic acid, Ivermectin, Sodium sulfacetamide, Sulfur. Perilesional erythema: Brimonidine, Oxymetazoline, Topical skin peeling agent if there are large occluded follicles. Electrocautery or laser for telangiectases. Daily lid hygiene, Oily tear substitute lubricating eye drops or aqueous gels.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "This given image shows acne excoriée on the chin of a male with compulsive picking of the face using nail pliers and tweezers. Acne excoriée is regarded as a self-inflicted skin condition in which the sufferer compulsively picks real or imagined acne lesions predominantly on the face. It is mostly seen in adolescent girls. Other psychiatric disorders associated with acne are: Body dysmorphic disorder - Some patients have acne as their prime symptom. The perceived acne is out of proportion to physical signs. Eating disorders - reported in anorexia nervosa. Acne itself may be a predisposing factor for anorexia in vulnerable teenage age groups who adopt a diet in an attempt to control their acne. Option B: Acne fulminans or acne maligna is a rare and severe destructive form of acne presenting primarily in adolescent males. It most frequently affects the trunk but can affect the face and presents acutely in association with systemic symptoms. Option C: Acne conglobata represents a rare and severe form of acne characterized by multiple and extensive inflammatory papules, tender nodules, and abscesses which commonly coalesce to form malodorous draining sinus tracts. Option D: Acne mechanica describes acne that occurs at the site of repeated mechanical trauma and/or frictional obstruction of the pilosebaceous outlet resulting in comedo formation. Examples include 'fiddler's neck', which may occur on the neck of violin players, and is characterized by well-defined plaques with the presence of comedones, lichenification, and pigmentation.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Glycolic acid is the preferred chemical peel agent in dark-skinned individuals. Dark skin (Fitzpatrick type IV to VI) has a tendency for post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) after procedures like lasers and chemical peels. Deep chemical peels cannot be used in dark-skinned patients. Even medium-depth peels need to be used with extreme caution. Chemical peels are believed to promote desquamation, which reduces corneocyte cohesion and keratinocyte plugging, so enabling the extrusion of inflammatory contents. Light chemical peels are used with the aim of helping to remove comedones as well as superficial scarring and hyperpigmentation. Other peeling agents are: Pyruvic acid, Lactic acid, Maleic acid, Citric acid, Tartaric acid, Mandelic acid, Jessner's Solution - lactic acid + salicyclic acid + resorcinol",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Rhinophyma (also known as potato nose) is a slowly progressive condition due to hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the sebaceous glands of the tip of the nose. It is often seen in cases of long-standing rosacea, called phymatous rosacea. It is not a neoplasm. It presents as a pink, lobulated mass over the nose with superficial vascular dilation. It mostly affects men past middle age. Patients seek advice because of the distorted appearance of the enlarged nose, or obstruction in breathing and vision. Rhinophyma may be diagnosed clinically, but a skin biopsy can confirm the diagnosis. On histology, rhinophyma shows sebaceous gland hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and fibrosis. The most common indication for treatment is cosmetic. Ablation using CO2 laser or surgical resection of excess tissue with remodeling of the nose can be performed.",

      "explanation": "The given image shows hidradenitis suppurativa or inverse acne. Surgical excision is the best treatment that offers a cure. Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic, inflammatory, recurrent, debilitating, follicular disease that usually presents after puberty. There are painful, deep-seated inflamed lesions in the apocrine gland-bearing areas of the body, most commonly the axillary, inguinal, and anogenital regions. This definition is based on the San Francisco modification of the Dessau criteria.
