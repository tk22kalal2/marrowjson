      "explanation": "Loeffler's serum slope is an enriched medium for the growth of Corynebacterium diphtheriae. It is not a selective medium as other organisms can also grow on this medium. The selective media for Corynebacterium diphtheriae are potassium tellurite agar, Tinsdale medium, and McLeod's medium (tellurite blood agar). Tellurite inhibits the growth of other bacteria. C. diphtheriae reduces the tellurite to metallic tellurium, giving its colonies a grey-black colour. On Loeffler's serum slope, colonies appear as small white opaque discs that may acquire a yellow tinge. The advantages of growing C. diphtheriae on Loeffler's serum slope are rapid growth in 6-8 hours and that it is the best medium for metachromatic granules production. The disadvantage of using this medium is that on incubation beyond 6-8 hours, it supports the growth of commensals as well.",

      "explanation": "Corynebacterium diphtheriae inactivates elongation factor-2, leading to cell membrane damage, cell death, and preventing protein synthesis by the ribosome. Lysogenic or phage conversion is seen in Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The toxigenicity of the diphtheria bacillus depends on the presence of the corynephages (tox+). When the bacillus is cured of the phage, its toxigenic capacity is lost. A bacteriophage is a virus that parasitizes bacteria. It can carry host DNA and transfer it to another bacterium. In lysogenic conversion, the viral DNA is integrated with the bacterial DNA and thus can code for new characteristics, like toxin production. The conversion of non-toxigenic bacterial strains to toxigenic by infecting them with bacteriophages is known as lysogenic conversion.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Toxin production of Corynebacterium diphtheria depends on the concentration of iron in the medium, presence of tox phage, and its biotype. Concentration of zinc in the medium has no effect on this process. An increase in iron concentration (option A) upregulates the DT (diphtheria toxin) repressor gene, thereby decreasing the toxin production. The optimum level of iron in the medium for toxin production is 0.14 µg/millilitre, while a concentration of 0.5 µg/millilitre inhibits the formation of toxins. The gene for diphtheria toxin is coded by bacteriophage (corynebacteriophage tox+) and thus the presence of phages (option B) is integral to toxin production. Toxin production also depends on the biotype (option C) - gravis, intermedius, mitis, and belfanti - of the bacilli. All four biotypes are toxigenic. Diphtheria toxin is also produced by Corynebacterium ulcerans and Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis.",

      "explanation": "Elek's test is used to test the toxigenicity of Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Elek's gel precipitation test is an in vitro immunoprecipitation (immunodiffusion) test used to determine whether or not a strain of Corynebacterium diphtheriae is toxigenic. In this test, a rectangular strip of filter paper impregnated with diphtheria antitoxin is placed on the surface of a 20% normal horse serum agar. Narrow streaks of the C. diphtheriae strains are made at right angles to the filter paper strip with positive and negative controls. If the strain produces toxins, the toxin will diffuse in the agar and produce a line of precipitation (arrowhead) where it meets the antitoxin at optimum concentration. The test is shown in the image below. Elek's gel precipitation test: Filter paper strip with C. diphtheriae toxin. Precipitin line. Known toxigenic C. diphtheriae. Option A: For checking susceptibility to diphtheria, the Schick test is used. Option B: The biotype of diphtheria can be determined based on colony morphology and biochemical reactions. Option D: The antibody titer against diphtheria can be measured by various serological methods like passive hemagglutination, latex agglutination test, toxoid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Toxoid-ELISA), and toxin-binding inhibition ELISA (TOBI-ELISA).",

      "explanation": "Diphtheria antibody titer is considered optimally protective if the titer is >0.1 IU/mL. Diphtheria is primarily the result of the action of diphtheria toxin, not bacterial invasion. Hence, antibodies to the diphtheria toxin are a good measure of protection against diphtheria. These antibodies can be induced by immunization with diphtheria toxoid vaccine. The titers of IgG antibody against diphtheria toxoid vaccine reflect various levels of protection against the disease as follows: • <0.01 IU/mL: No protection ⚫ 0.01-0.1 IU/mL: Minimal protection • >0.1 IU/mL: Optimal protection. Note: The question asks for the optimally protective titer and not the minimum effective titer, which is >0.01 IU/mL.",

      "explanation": "A child with fever, sore throat, dysphagia, and a tonsillar pseudomembrane likely has diphtheria. Pupillary reactions remain normal and pupillary paralysis is not a complication seen with diphtheria. The complications of diphtheria include asphyxia due to the mechanical airway obstruction by the pseudomembrane. Myocarditis and polyneuropathy are toxic complications of diphtheria. Patients may develop post-diphtheritic paralysis involving palatine and ciliary nerves. Paralysis of the diaphragm and neurogenic bladder dysfunction may also occur.

Sucrose fermentation is done to differentiate between C. diphtheriae and diphtheroids. Diphtheroids: • They are corynebacteria resembling C. diphtheriae which occur as normal commensals in the throat, skin, conjunctiva, and other areas. • In general, diphtheroids stain more uniformly than diphtheria bacilli and possess few or no metachromatic granules. Most of them do not produce toxins. • They tend to be arranged in parallel rows (palisades) rather than the cuneiform pattern. • The common diphtheroids include Corynebacterium xerosis.",

      "explanation": "The above image shows a raised, well-circumscribed, violaceous lesion with the absence of pus. Thus, it is erysipeloid, which is a skin infection caused by Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. Erysipeloid usually occurs on the fingers by direct inoculation at the site of a cut or abrasion, in people who handle animals, fish, or animal products. Pain, swelling, and erythema develop, and the condition has been called seal finger and whale finger. Pus is usually absent at the infection site, which helps differentiate it from staphylococcal and streptococcal skin infections. It resolves without treatment in 3-4 weeks. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is a slender, non-motile, non-sporing Gram-positive bacillus. It is catalase, oxidase, and indole negative. It causes disease in multiple land animals, like swine, turkeys, and sheep. Note: Erysipelas is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. It presents as erythematous raised lesions with sharply demarcated edges.",

Listeria monocytogenes shows slow tumbling motility when grown at 25 °C. But at 37°C, it is non-motile because the peritrichous flagella are produced by the bacillus optimally between 20°C and 30°C. This is known as differential motility as the motility pattern changes with a change in temperature. Listeria moves from cell-to-cell using the host cell actin framework. Listeria infection can manifest as febrile gastroenteritis, bacteremia, neurolisteriosis, and granulomatosis infantiseptica.",

Listeria monocytogenes can survive at refrigerator temperatures (4°C), under conditions of low pH and high salt. So it is able to overcome food preservation and safety barriers, making it an important foodborne pathogen. Healthy persons exposed to L. monocytogenes in food may develop a mild, self-limiting febrile gastroenteritis lasting 1-3 days. This develops after an incubation period of 6-48 hours.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The most common clinical form of actinomycosis is cervicofacial. Actinomycosis is a chronic granulomatous infection characterized by indurated swellings, mainly in the connective tissue, suppuration, and discharge of sulfur granules. The most common causative agent is Actinomyces israelii. Various clinical forms of actinomycosis involve cervicofacial, thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic actinomycosis. Among them, actinomycosis most frequently occurs as an oral-cervicofacial form presenting as a soft tissue swelling, abscess, or mass lesion involving the angle of the jaw.",

      "question": "Detailed explanations: Fever, sore throat, and difficulty in swallowing with the presence of a dirty white pseudomembrane on the posterior pharynx is strongly suggestive of diphtheria caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. They are described as club-shaped gram-positive bacilli. Corynebacterium diphtheriae are gram-positive, non-sporing, non-capsulated, and non-motile bacilli. They possess polymetaphosphate granules that serve as storage granules and are called metachromatic granules. These give the bacilli a beaded or club-shaped appearance on microscopic examination. The given scenario is suggestive of diphtheria caused by Corynebacterium diphtheria. This organism is stained using Albert's stain, which contains toluidine blue 'O' and malachite green. Both these dyes have an affinity for acidic cytoplasm as they are basic dyes. Albert's, Neisser's, and Ponder's stain are used to demonstrate the metachromatic granules (Volutin/Babes Ernst granules) of Corynebacterium diphtheria. Corynebacterium diphtheria appears as green-coloured bacilli with purple-blue-coloured metachromatic granules in a cuneiform arrangement.",
      "options": {
        "A": "Gram-negative diplococci describe Neisseria meningitis and N. gonorrhoeae.",
        "B": "Spiral gram-negative bacteria describe Campylobacter spp. and Helicobacter spp.",
        "C": "Gram-positive cocci in chains describe Streptococci. They typically cause acute exudative pharyngitis characterized by purulent exudate over the tonsils.",
        "D": "Gram-positive rods with club-shaped ends, beaded appearance, and a Chinese-letter pattern of arrangement are indicative of Corynebacterium diphtheriae."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The correct answer is related to the staining method used for Corynebacterium diphtheriae, which is Albert's stain. This stain is used to demonstrate the metachromatic granules of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and it contains toluidine blue 'O' and malachite green. These dyes have an affinity for acidic cytoplasm as they are basic dyes.",
