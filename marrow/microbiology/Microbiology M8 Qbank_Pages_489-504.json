      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "A host in which the larval stage of the parasite remains viable without further development isreferred to as the paratenic host.For example, in the lifecycle of Diphyllobothrium latum (fish tapeworm), humans are thedefinitive host. The first intermediate host is cyclops and the second is small freshwater fish. If thesmall freshwater fish with the plerocercoid larva get eaten by a larger fish, the larva survives in thelarger fish. This makes the larger fish a paratenic host.Host is an organism that harbors the parasite and provides nourishment and shelter to it. It isrelatively larger than the parasite.Types of hosts:•• Definitive host - harbors stages of sexual reproduction of the parasite.• Intermediate host - harbors stages of asexual multiplication of the parasite.• Paratenic host - harbors only the larval stage of the parasite which remains viable withoutfurther development.• Reservoir host - harbors the parasite and acts as an important source of infection to othersusceptible hosts, especially in endemic areas.• Accidental host - harbors a parasite that is not usually found in the host.",

Some multiply inside hepaticcells to form schizonts while others persist and remain dormant as hypnozoites (resting forms).These dormant forms may get activated and release merozoites, which go on infecting RBCsproducing true clinical relapse. It usually occurs after 6 to 12 months of complete cure from thedisease.503In case of P. falciparum and P.malariae, the initial tissue phase disappears completely and nohypnozoites are found, hence relapse is not seen.In Plasmodium falciparum, recrudescence can be seen which is defined as the recurrence ofasexual parasitemia.
