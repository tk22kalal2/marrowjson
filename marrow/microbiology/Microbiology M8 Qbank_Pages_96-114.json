      "question": "An elderly diabetic lady presented with swelling and pain of her right leg following a skin biopsy. She was febrile at the time of examination and hemorrhagic bullae with necrosis of the surrounding skin were noted on her leg. Gram staining of the pus collected from the bullae is shown below.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given clinical vignette is strongly suggestive of necrotizing fasciitis, which is most commonly caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus). Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly progressive inflammatory infection of the fascia, with secondary necrosis of the subcutaneous tissues. It has also been referred to as Meleney ulcer, acute dermal gangrene, hospital gangrene, suppurative fasciitis, and synergistic necrotizing cellulitis. The source of the infection is either the skin, with organisms introduced into the tissue through trauma, or the bowel flora, with organisms released during abdominal surgery. The onset of symptoms is usually quite acute and is marked by severe pain at the site of involvement, malaise, fever, chills, and a toxic appearance. The affected limb is edematous with the overlying skin turning dusky with mottled erythema and the development of hemorrhagic bullae. This is a surgical emergency as the condition is rapidly fatal. Treatment of the condition includes: Surgical intervention is the major therapeutic modality in cases of necrotizing fasciitis. Antibiotics - penicillin (1-4 million U IV q4h) plus clindamycin (600-900 mg IV q8h).",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given case scenario of a patient with fever, sore throat, and a scarlatiniform rash is suggestive of scarlet fever caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. Streptolysin S is the factor responsible for the zones of hemolysis seen around streptococcal colonies on blood agar. Streptococci produce two hemolysins: Streptolysin O is called so because it is oxygen-labile. It is also heat-labile and has specific cardiotoxic and leucotoxic activity. Streptolysin S is called so because it is soluble in serum. It is also oxygen-stable hemolysin. It is a protein but is not antigenic.",

      "explanation": "Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins type A and type C are bacteriophage-mediated toxins. The streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (SPE) is so named because the primary effect of the toxin is the induction of fever. It is also known as erythrogenic toxin because its intradermal injection into susceptible individuals produces an erythematous reaction (Dick Test). There are three types of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins, namely: type A, phage-mediated; type B, chromosome-mediated; and type C, phage-mediated.",

      "explanation": "Hyaluronidase is the streptococcal toxin responsible for connective tissue breakdown. Hyaluronidase, or spreading factor, is expressed by non-capsulated strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, such as M type 4 and 22. It acts by cleaving hyaluronic acid, which is present in the connective tissue, epithelial, and neural tissues. This results in the spread of infection along the intercellular space.",

      "explanation": "Streptococcus agalactiae is a group B streptococci that shows beta-hemolysis on blood agar, is resistant to bacitracin, and gives a positive CAMP test. The CAMP test is used to identify group B beta-hemolytic streptococci based on their ability to form CAMP factor. This factor causes synergistic hemolysis with beta-hemolysin formed by Staphylococcus aureus, when Streptococcus agalactiae is inoculated perpendicular to a streak of Staphylococcus aureus on blood agar. This produces the characteristic arrow-head zone of hemolysis. The following table provides important laboratory characteristics which differentiate Streptococcus pyogenes from Streptococcus agalactiae. Species: Lancefield Group, Typical Hemolysis, Important Lab Characteristic: S. pyogenes: A, beta, Bacitracin sensitive, PYR test positive.

Bacitracin sensitivity is used to differentiate between group A and group B β-hemolytic streptococci. Group A: Bacitracin-sensitive (S. pyogenes). Group B: Bacitracin-resistant (S. agalactiae). Options A & B: Bile solubility and optochin sensitivity are used to differentiate Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. They are both α-hemolytic on blood agar, but some species of viridans streptococci are non-hemolytic. Option D: Catalase test is used to differentiate streptococcus and staphylococcus.

Staphylococcus aureus does not have a capsule and so poses no increased risk to these individuals. The phagocytosis of capsulated organisms is prevented by their capsule. Thus, the body's main defense against these organisms is the spleen. Certain components called opsonins attach to these capsulated organisms, and then they are delivered to the spleen, where their uptake is facilitated by receptors present on the surface of splenic phagocytes.
