E. coli produces the enzyme β-glucuronidase, which is tested using the MUG test. In it, the substrate MUG (4-methylumbelliferyl-β-glucuronide) is reduced by the enzyme to produce a fluorescent color, which indicates a positive MUG test.",

Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) is the most common organism that causes diarrhea in travelers. It produces the following toxins: \n   • LT (heat-labile toxin) - acts by increasing cAMP\n   • ST (heat-stable toxin) - two types of ST are known, ST-A (ST-I) and ST-B (ST-II)\n   • ST-A is soluble in methanol and acts by increasing cGMP in the intestine.\n   • ST-B is insoluble in methanol, and the mode of action is not known.\n   Other options:\n   Option A: Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) causes infantile diarrhea in developing countries. It adheres to the mucosal surface of the small intestine using E. coli adherent factor (EAF) and locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) and causes effacement of microvilli.\n   Option B: Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) produces verocytotoxin, which targets vascular endothelium. It causes hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome.\n   Option D: Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) invades interstitial epithelial cells in the intestine and causes a condition resembling shigellosis.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Attachment and effacement lesions on intestinal cells are caused by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC). E. coli is the second most common cause of diarrhea in the pediatric age group. Rotavirus is the most common cause. EPEC causes watery diarrhea, which is self-limiting. EPEC adheres to the mucosal cells of the small bowel and causes loss of microvilli (effacement). This leads to the formation of filamentous actin pedestals or cuplike structures and occasionally may cause entry of the EPEC into the mucosal cells. Pathogenicity requires the presence of two important factors: Bundle-forming pilus encoded by plasmid containing EPEC adherence factor (EAF), and chromosomal locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island. Enteropathogenic (EPEC) E. coli intestinal invasion mechanism: EspA, Intimin, Microvilli, BFP (Bundle-forming pili), Pedestal, EspB, EspD, EPEC replication, Actin, Intestinal epithelium, Actin, LEE, Tir, EspF, EspG, EspC, Biofilm formation, EspH.

Intestinal colonization of EAEC is mediated by aggregative adherence fimbriae (AAF). EAST-1 toxin (enteroaggregative heat-stable toxin) is considered to be a major virulence factor for EAEC.

      "explanation": "Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is caused by enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) serotype O157:H7. It produces a Shiga-like toxin, therefore EHEC is also known as Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC). Other options: Option A - Strains of E. coli producing verocytotoxin or Shiga toxin (stx2a-g) can cause diarrheal disease ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal hemorrhagic colitis and HUS. The most common EHEC belongs to serotype O157:H7. Option C - In EHEC diarrhea, fecal leukocytes are commonly seen (70%), but although it is an infectious condition, fever is not seen. The absence of fever can lead to its misdiagnosis as a non-infectious condition such as intussusception or ischemic bowel disease. Option D - The disease is transmitted through contaminated feces. Person-to-person transmission can occur if infected persons do not wash their hands after using the toilet or after changing diapers. Note: Shiga toxin produced by S. dysenteriae is referred to as Stx.",

E. coli O157:H7 does not ferment sorbitol and produces pale colonies on Sorbitol-MacConkey agar. All other strains of E. coli ferment sorbitol; thus, they produce pink colonies on Sorbitol-MacConkey agar. O157:H7 strains do not contain β-glucuronidase and so are unable to use the substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-glucuronide (MUG). Thus, they give a negative MUG test.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Proteus increases the risk of struvite stones in the bladder as it leads to the alkalinization of urine. Struvite stones are magnesium-ammonium phosphate stones that appear as rectangular/coffin-lid crystals shaped on urine microscopy. Uric acid stones are precipitated in acidic urine. Proteus produces the enzyme phenylalanine deaminase, which converts phenylalanine to phenylpyruvic acid. This property is the basis for the phenylalanine deaminase test. The test is performed by inoculating the organism in phenylalanine agar. After incubation, 10% ferric chloride is added to the media. If phenylpyruvic acid was produced, it will react with the ferric chloride and turn dark green. If the medium remains a straw color, the organism is negative for phenylalanine deaminase production. E. coli is an aerobe and facultative anaerobe. Its motility is due to the presence of peritrichous flagella. It is the most common cause of urinary tract infections.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The given image of the blood culture finding shows the characteristic bull's eye swarming pattern exhibited by Proteus. Proteus species move very actively with the help of peritrichous flagella, resulting in swarming on solid media. It can be suppressed by the addition of: phenyl ethyl alcohol, chloral hydrate, sulphonamides, sodium azide, boric acid, or increasing the concentration of agar to 6%. Swarming does not occur on MacConkey medium and cystine-lactose-electrolyte-deficient (CLED) medium. Proteus is a gram-negative bacillus seen as a normal gastrointestinal flora. The two most common species causing infection in humans are P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris, which can be differentiated by the spot indole test. P. mirabilis is indole negative, while P. vulgaris is indole positive. Production of urease enzyme by Proteus, which hydrolyses urea to ammonia, causes alkalinization of urine. Alkalinization of urine leads to the precipitation of organic and inorganic compounds, which contributes to the formation of Struvite stones. P. mirabilis is associated with urinary tract infections, while P. vulgaris is usually associated with wound and soft tissue infections. Other organisms that show swarming include Clostridium tetani, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Serratia.",

K. rhinoscleromatis is a gram-negative bacillus, also known as Frisch bacillus. It is endemic in North India. Rhinoscleroma is characterized by chronic granulomatous hypertrophy of the nose.
