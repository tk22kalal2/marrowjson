      "explanation": "The given scenario and the image showing gram-negative coccobacilli in the CSF are suggestive of Hemophilus meningitis caused by H. influenzae. Hemophilus meningitis is more common in children between 3 months and 3 years of age and not common in young adults. Option A: Meningitis is the most serious disease caused by H. influenzae. The case fatality rate is 90% if untreated. Option C: H. influenzae is transmitted via respiratory droplets. Thus, it is introduced into the nasopharynx of the contacts of an infected individual. It has to enter the bloodstream to reach the meninges. Option D: Cefotaxime or ceftazidime are the drugs of choice for the treatment of Hemophilus meningitis.",

H. influenzae is typed into 6 serotypes (a to f) based on the capsular polysaccharide. Serotype b (Hib) is the most virulent and accounts for most of the invasive infections. The differences between type b strains and non-typable strains of H. influenzae are given in the table below: Feature - Capsule - Pathogenesis, Type B strains - Made of Ribosyl-ribitol phosphate - Invasive infections due to hematogenous spread, Clinical manifestations - Meningitis and invasive infections in incompletely immunized infants and children, Epiglottitis, Cellulitis, Pneumonia, Nontypable strains - Unencapsulated - Mucosal infections due to contagious spread, Otitis media in children, Exacerbation of COPD, Puerperal sepsis, Sinusitis, Vaccine - Highly effective conjugate vaccines - Not available",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given clinical vignette and 'thumb sign' on the X-ray are suggestive of acute epiglottitis caused by Hemophilus influenzae. It is an acute inflammation of the epiglottis causing obstructive laryngitis and presents with high fever, severe sore throat, tachycardia, systemic toxicity, and drooling as patients are unable to swallow. The patient characteristically leans forward while sitting for ease of breathing. The diagnosis often is made on clinical grounds. On direct fiberoptic laryngoscopy, the typical edematous cherry-red epiglottis is visualized. Neck radiographs reveal an enlarged edematous epiglottis (Thumb sign). The below image shows the Thumb sign. In some countries, widespread vaccination against Hib has drastically decreased acute epiglottitis cases in children by over 90%. However, the incidence in adults has remained largely unchanged since the Hib vaccine was introduced. Despite vaccination efforts, many pediatric cases of epiglottitis today are still caused by Hib due to either lack of vaccination or vaccine ineffectiveness. In adults and increasingly in children, other bacterial pathogens, particularly group A Streptococcus, have been linked to cases of epiglottitis. Treatment includes airway management followed by administration of antibiotics like ampicillin/sulbactam, cefotaxime, or ceftriaxone.",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Pneumonia due to a gram-negative pleomorphic bacillus growing on chocolate agar which iscatalase and oxidase-positive is most likely Haemophilus influenza.Haemophilus pneumonia typically occurs in infants and is accompanied by empyema andsometimes meningitis as well. In older children and adults, the picture is of lobarpneumonia. Sputum is collected for the detection and isolation of Hemophilus. As the bacillus isvery sensitive to low temperatures, specimens should never be refrigerated before inoculation.H.infiuenzae is a Gram-negative, non-motile, non-sporing bacillus, exhibiting considerable257pleomorphism. In sputum, it usually occurs as clusters of coccobacillary forms.The bacillus has fastidious growth requirements. The accessory growth factors, named X and V,present in the blood are essential for growth. Catalase andoxidase reactions are positive. Nitrates are reduced to nitrites. Biotyping has been done on thebasis of indole production.Cultures may be preserved for about a month on chocolate agar slopes. Chocolate agar is made byheating blood agar to 80-90°C for 15-20 minutes. This causes the release of V factor from withinthe erythrocytes.Treatment- Amoxycillin-clavulanate or clarithromycin is more effective in treating respiratoryinfections by Haemophilus influenzae.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario describes an acute exacerbation of COPD characterized by low-gradefever, increased cough, sputum production, and shortness of breath. The most common cause ofthese are non-typable H. influenzae which lack a capsule and so capsular antigen cannot be avirulence factor.All H. influenzae have the following virulence factors:•• Outer membrane proteins (OMP)• Lipooligosaccharide (LOS)• PiliIn addition to the above factors, H. influenzae type b also has its capsular polysaccharide as avirulence factor.The differences between Hib and non-typable strains are given below:FeatureCapsulePathogenesisClinical manifestationsVaccineType b strainsMade of Ribosyl-ribitol phosphateInvasive infections due to hematogenous spreadMeningitis and invasive infections incompletely immunized infants and childrenEpiglottitis Cellulitis PneumoniaHighly effective conjugate vaccinesNontypable strainsUnencapsulatedMucosal infections due to contagious spreadOtitis media in childrenExacerbation of COPD, Puerperal sepsisSinusitisNot available",

Chancroid is characterized by non-indurated, tender, irregular ulcers that may bleed on touch. The neighboring lymph nodes are enlarged, painful, and tender. Other options: Option B - Treponema pallidum causes syphilis, characterized by a chancre - a single painless ulcer with a clean base and a firm raised border, with painless lymphadenopathy.
