      "explanation": "Rocky Mountain spotted fever is caused by Rickettsia rickettsii. A cell wall is present in rickettsialorganisms.Rickettsiae are obligate intracellular, gram-negative pleomorphic coccobacilli. They are unable togrow in cell-free media and are thus cultured in yolk sacs of embryonated eggs. They arenon-motile, non-capsulated organisms that contain both DNA and RNA. They reproduce bybinary fission and are transmitted by arthropods like ticks and lice (except Coxiella burnetii andBartonella henselae).The rickettsiae are localized in endothelial cells of small blood vessels (except Ehrlichia andAnaplasma) in humans. They cause endothelial cell enlargement and degeneration, predisposing307to thrombus formation. Tetracyclines, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones are effective against thisgroup but, beta-lactams are ineffective.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The vector for endemic murine typhus is the rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis. Endemic murine typhus is caused by Rickettsia typhi (not option B) while epidemic typhus is caused by Rickettsia prowazekii. The zoonotic reservoir for R. typhi is the rat. Humans are infected when flea feces contaminate pruritic bite lesions. Transmission can also occur via inhalation of aerosols of dried feces of rickettsemic rat flea. No man-to-man transmission occurs. Patients present with fever, chills, vomiting, and a maculopapular rash that is more prominent on the trunk. Diagnosis is by serology and treatment is with doxycycline. When male guinea pigs are inoculated intraperitoneally with blood from a case of endemic typhus, they develop fever and a characteristic scrotal inflammation. The scrotum becomes enlarged and the testes cannot be pushed into the abdomen. This is known as the Neil-Mooser reaction. It is positive with Rickettsia typhi (not option D) and negative with Rickettsia prowazekii.",

        "D": "Transovarian transmission does not occur"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Epidemic typhus rash spares the palms and soles. Epidemic typhus, caused by Rickettsia prowazekii, is transmitted by the louse Pediculus humanus corporis. There is no transovarial transmission of R. prowazekii. The disease spreads through infected louse feces deposited when the louse feeds on the human host. It is commonly seen in poor, unhygienic, or cold conditions. Epidemic typhus starts with fever and chills. A characteristic rash appears on the fourth or fifth day, starting on the trunk and spreading over the limbs but sparing the face, palms, and soles. In some patients who recover from epidemic typhus, the rickettsiae may remain latent in the lymphoid tissues or organs for years. Such latent infection may, at times, be reactivated, leading to recrudescent typhus (Brill-Zinsser disease). Transovarial transmission refers to passing on the disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod. It occurs with Orientia tsutsugamushi, Rickettsia rickettsii, R. conorii, and R. akari. Note: Rash on palms and soles is typically described in Rocky Mountain spotted fever, secondary syphilis, and hand, foot, and mouth disease.",

In the case of pregnant women, oral azithromycin 500 mg for 3 days may be used as doxycycline is contraindicated in pregnancy. Scrub typhus is a rickettsial infection caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi. The vector is a trombiculid mite. Humans are infected when they are bitten by the mite larvae known as chiggers. The incubation period is 1-3 weeks. Patients develop a characteristic eschar at the site of the mite bite, along with regional lymphadenopathy and maculopapular rash. It can be associated with fever, headache, myalgia, meningoencephalitis, myocarditis, and pneumonia. Serologic assays are used for diagnosis. Weil-Felix reaction is a heterophile agglutination reaction used for diagnosis, wherein the sera are tested for agglutinins to the O antigens of Proteus strains OX19, OX2, and OXK. OXK alone is agglutinated in scrub typhus.",
