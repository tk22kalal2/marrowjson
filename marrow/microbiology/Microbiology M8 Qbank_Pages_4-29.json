      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Pasteurization is done at 63 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes. Pasteurization is the process of applying heat to milk to kill or stunt the growth of pathogenic bacteria. It was developed by Louis Pasteur. There are two methods for pasteurization: \n   • Holder method: Milk is heated at 63°C for 30 minutes \n   • Flash process: Milk is heated to 72°C for 15-20 seconds \n   Once heated appropriately, the milk is cooled quickly to 13°C or lower. All the non-sporing pathogens (mycobacteria, brucellae, salmonellae) are killed in pasteurization. In the Holder method, heat-resistant Coxiella burnetii may survive. \n   Note: Louis Pasteur pioneered the techniques of pasteurization and sterilization. He also first advanced the germ theory of disease, which states that most diseases were caused by microorganisms. Furthermore, he disproved the theory of spontaneous generation and developed vaccines for rabies and fowl cholera. He is thus known as the father of modern microbiology.",

Lawn or carpet culture is the method in which a uniform surface growth of bacteria is present on the medium. It is used for antibiotic sensitivity testing (disc method) and bacteriophage typing. Stab culture (option D) is used for demonstration of gelatin liquefaction and oxygen requirements of bacteria, for maintenance of stock cultures. Streak culture (option A) is routinely used for the isolation of bacteria in pure culture from clinical specimens. Stroke culture (option C) is used for providing pure growth of bacteria for slide agglutination and other diagnostic tests. Other methods of culture include: Liquid culture - these are preferred for inocula containing antibiotics and other inhibitory substances. Pour plate culture - it gives an estimate of viable bacterial count in a suspension.",

      "explanation": "The given image shows Quellung reaction (halo around the bacteria) and is seen in capsulated bacteria. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is not capsulated, therefore Quellung reaction will not be observed in it. In Quellung reaction, a suspension of a capsulated bacterium is mixed with its specific anticapsular serum and examined under the microscope. The anticapsular antibodies bind to the capsule and thus the capsule becomes very prominent and appears swollen. Capsulated organisms can be remembered with the following mnemonic: Some Streptococcus pneumoniae Killers Klebsiella pneumoniae Have Haemophilus influenzae Nice Neisseria meningitidis Capsules Cryptococcus neoformans.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The given clinical vignette of fever and hemoptysis in a labourer with the sputum smear showing acid-fast bacilli is suggestive of tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, detected on sputum smear, is appreciated by Ziehl-Neelsen staining, which would include carbol fuchsin - acid alcohol - methylene blue. Acid-fast bacteria (like MTB) in a stained Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) smear appear bright red against a blue background. Steps involved in ZN staining are: Place the sample on a slide and evenly spread it with rotational movement. Air-dry the slide and fix it by passing it over a flame. Apply carbol fuchsin stain and heat to fix it. Wash with water to remove excess stain. Decolourise with alcohol. Apply Methylene blue/Malachite green stain. Wash with water to remove excess stain. View under the microscope. Kinyoun modified the classical ZN staining such that heat fixing is not required. It is called the cold method. It involves increasing the concentration of phenol acid and the duration of staining. The slide is then washed with water and decolourized with acid alcohol. Counterstaining with Loeffler's methylene blue or malachite green is done for a minute and viewed under a microscope. Acid-fast bacteria in a stained smear appear bright red against a blue background.",

      "question": "An orthopedician is performing the following procedure to visualize the anterior cruciate ligament in a patient. Which of the following will be used to sterilize the instrument used?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Ethylene oxide",
        "B": "Gamma rays",
        "C": "Hydrogen peroxide",
        "D": "Ultraviolet rays"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given image shows arthroscopy being performed. Arthroscopes are sterilized using plasma sterilization, which utilizes hydrogen peroxide. In plasma sterilization, radiofrequency energy is applied to create an electromagnetic field through which hydrogen peroxide vapors are passed. This generates plasma, which contains free radicals of hydrogen and oxygen. Plasma denatures all organisms and is used to sterilize arthroscopes and ureteroscopes. Sterilization control is monitored by Geobacillus stearothermophilus and Bacillus atrophaeus. Option A: Ethylene oxide has both microbicidal and sporicidal activity. It is used for sterilization of heat-sensitive equipment like heart-lung machines, respirators, suture materials, etc. Sterilization control is monitored by Bacillus atrophaeus and Bacillus subtilis. Option B: Gamma rays cause breakage of DNA. They destroy spores and vegetative cells, but are not effective against viruses. It is referred to as cold sterilization and is used in commercial plants to sterilize plastics, syringes, swabs. Sterilization control is monitored by Bacillus pumilius. Option D: Ultraviolet rays are used to sterilize biosafety cabinets, entryways, operation theaters, and laboratories.",

      "question": "Detailed Explanations: This is a modern compound microscope, and the condenser is located below the stage. Parts of microscope: Ocular lens (eye piece), Nose piece, Objective lens, Stage clip, Aperture, Diaphragm, Condenser, Light source, MARROW, Head, Arm, Mechanical stage, Coarse adjustment, Fine adjustment, Brightness adjustment. The purpose of the condenser lens is to focus the light from the illuminator onto the specimen. Microscopes with a stage condenser lens render a sharper image than those with no condenser lens. The simple microscope was invented first by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, the father of microscopy and microbiology. It uses 1 lens for magnification. The compound microscope, introduced by Hans and Zacharias Janssen, uses 2 lenses, an objective lens and an eyepiece, to provide better magnification power than the simple microscope. Solution to Question 2: A painless genital ulcer with inguinal lymphadenopathy with the presence of spiral organisms on microscopy is suggestive of syphilis. It is caused by Treponema pallidum, demonstrated by dark-field microscopy. Dark-field microscopy images have a dark background with a refractile organism. The dark-ground microscope has an optical system that enhances the contrast of unstained bodies. It uses reflected light and has a higher resolving power than the light microscope. Dark-field microscopy is the most specific and sensitive technique to visualize Treponema pallidum when an active chancre or condyloma lata is present.",

        "A": "Dark-field microscopy improves the contrast to delineate structures within cells. A dark image is formed on a light background.",
        "B": "Phase contrast microscopy improves the contrast to delineate structures within cells. A dark image is formed on a light background.",
        "C": "Fluorescent microscopy uses fluorescent dyes like auramine-rhodamine to appreciate Mycobacterial species and malarial parasites.",
        "D": "The electron microscope, invented by Ernst Ruska, helps in appreciating viral structures. It has a very high resolving power."
