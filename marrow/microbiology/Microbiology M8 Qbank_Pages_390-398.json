      "explanation": "HIV is a thermolabile virus. It is readily inactivated by heating to 60 °C for 10 minutes and at 100°C in seconds. At room temperature (20-25 °C) in the dried blood, it may survive for 1 week.Option A: HIV crosses the blood-brain barrier. It may cause encephalopathy leading to loss ofhigher functions, progressing to dementia.Option B: HIV is a spherical, enveloped virus. Its genome is composed of two copies of identicalsingle-stranded positive-sense RNA.Option C: HIV is inactivated by treatment with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide, 50% ethanol, 35%isopropanol or 10% household bleach. A 2% solution of glutaraldehyde is effective for thedisinfection of medical instruments.393",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The risk of HIV acquisition associated with unprotected receptive anal intercourse is relativelyhigher than that seen in penile-vaginal intercourse. This is because the rectal mucosal membraneis thin and fragile and anal intercourse is associated with microtrauma (rectal tears).The differences in transmission rates between men and women are because the vagina and cervixare exposed to semen for a longer duration, increasing the risk of transmission. However, thepenis and urethral orifice are exposed relatively briefly to infected vaginal fluid, lowering the risk.",

      "explanation": "Antibodies against gp41 will be detected first by ELISA or Western blot.Antibodies to HIV usually appear within 3-6 weeks of primary infection. The appearance ofHIV-binding antibodies occurs prior to the appearance of neutralizing antibodies. The only viralproteins that elicit neutralizing antibodies are the envelope proteins gp120 and gp41.The order of appearance of antibodies is as follows:Antibody to envelope gp41 &gt; Antibodies to gag protein (p24 and p55) &gt; Antibodies toenvelope gp120 &gt; Antibodies to gag protein p17 &gt; Antibodies to pol gene products (p31 andp66).Note: The earliest antigen to appear in the blood following HIV infection is p24.",

ELISA is a simple, relativelyinexpensive screening test.The most commonly used confirmatory test is Western blot.
