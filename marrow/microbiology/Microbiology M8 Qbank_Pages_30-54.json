      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Giving pre-formed immunoglobulin (e.g., Tetanus immunoglobulin) directly is an example of passive immunity, which is not long-lasting. The differentiating features between active and passive immunity: Negative phase: It is the time period during which the level of measurable immunity is lower than it was before the antigenic stimulus. This is because the antigen combines with any pre-existing antibody and lowers its level in circulation. It is seen at the beginning of the active immune response. Secondary type response: If an individual who has been actively immunized against an antigen experiences the same antigen subsequently, the immune response occurs more quickly and abundantly than during the first encounter. Active Immunity: Actively produced by the host, induced by infection or immunogens, immunological memory present, immunity is effective after a lag period or latent period, broad specificity, a negative phase may occur, booster effect on subsequent dose, secondary type response seen, more effective, long-lasting (years). Example: Vaccines. Passive Immunity: Readymade antibody is transferred, no memory, immediate immunity, narrow specificity, no negative phase, the subsequent dose is less effective, no secondary type of response, less effective, short-lasting (days to weeks). Example: Antisera.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Bone morphogenetic protein-like receptors are not pattern-recognition receptors. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are essential for the innate immune system. They identify pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) common to classes of microbes and trigger immune responses. These receptors can be found on the cell surface, detecting extracellular pathogens, or within the endosomes and cellular matrix, detecting intracellular invading viruses. PRRs activate pro-inflammatory pathways, promote phagocytosis in cells like macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, and may act as secreted proteins binding directly to pathogens. Based on the localization and functional characteristics, PRRs are classified as: Membrane-bound PRRs: Toll-like receptors (TLR) - detect microbial carbohydrates and lipoproteins (Option B), C-type lectin receptors (CLR) - detect mannose residues. Cytoplasmic (intracellular) PRRs: Nucleotide oligomerization (NOD)-like receptors (NLR) - NOD1 and NOD2 - detect bacterial cell wall peptidoglycans (Option A), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) - detect viral RNA (Option C). Secreted PRRs. On the contrary, BMP receptors are multifunctional transmembrane serine-threonine kinase receptors that belong to the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, regulating cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis with no role in pattern recognition. Also, there are no receptors termed 'BMP-like receptors'. Note: A mutation in the Bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) gene enhances the proliferation and reduces the apoptosis of pulmonary vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, leading to hereditary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).",

      "explanation": "T cell-dependent antigens activate only mature B cells. Depending on their ability to induce the formation of antibodies, antigens are classified as T-cell-dependent and T-cell-independent antigens. T cell-dependent antigens (TD) require helper T cell participation for the production of immune response, are structurally complex, and directly stimulate antibody production by B cells. T cell-dependent antigens (TD) activate only mature B cells monoclonally. B cells undergo affinity maturation and class switch over. All classes of antibodies are activated. Rapidly metabolized, immunological memory is present. T cell-independent antigens (TI) activate both mature and immature B cells polyclonally. B cells do not undergo affinity maturation and class switch over. Antibody response is restricted to IgM and IgG3. Slowly metabolized, no immunological memory.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "This woman presented with fever, hypotension, and a diffuse erythematous rash, three days after a nasal packing was done. This is characteristic of toxic shock syndrome - commonly caused by staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), which is a superantigen. Superantigens act by causing polyclonal activation of T cells. They activate a large number of T cells irrespective of their antigen specificity. In contrast to regular antigens which bind to the binding groove on T cells, superantigens bind outside the groove directly to the lateral aspect of the TCR β chain. This leads to a massive release of cytokines and polyclonal activation of T cells. Clinically, this manifests as fever, hypotension, and skin exfoliation. Superantigen - Antigen presenting cell - MHC II - Antigen - T cell receptor - T cell receptor. Examples of organisms that produce superantigens: Bacterial - Staphylococcus aureus - Enterotoxins - Group A streptococci - Pyrogenic exotoxin - Mycoplasma arthritidis - mitogen 1 - Yersinia enterocolitica - Yersinia pseudotuberculosis - Viral - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) - Cytomegalovirus (CMV) - Rabies nucleocapsid - HIV-encoded negative regulatory factor - Fungal - Malassezia furfur",

It is present in secretions such as milk, saliva, and tears, and in secretions of the respiratory, intestinal, and genital tracts. When present in the serum, it exists as a monomer similar to IgG. However, when it is secreted, it exists as a dimer. The dimeric structure consists of two monomers, which are stabilized by two additional polypeptides: the J chain, which stabilizes the molecule, and the secretory component, which is incorporated into the IgA when transported through the epithelial cell.

        "C": "mRNA splicing",
        "D": "VDJ rearrangement"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Affinity maturation is due to somatic hypermutation. Affinity maturation is the process by which antibodies gain increased affinity, avidity, and anti-pathogen activity. It is a result of somatic hypermutation (SHM) of immunoglobulin genes in B cells, coupled to selection for antigen binding. This process occurs in the germinal centers and proceeds for weeks after acute infection or vaccination, or for many cycles during chronic infection. The resulting antibodies can be highly mutated from their germline-encoded counterparts, with increases of several orders of magnitude in affinity for antigen compared to the corresponding naïve B cell receptors (BCRs). Other options: Option A: Isotype switching, also known as class switch recombination, is a process where the constant region of the antibody heavy chain is changed, leading to a switch in the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgG). This process is crucial for the functional properties of antibodies but is not directly involved in affinity maturation. Option C: mRNA splicing is a cellular process that involves the removal of introns and the joining of exons to generate mature mRNA. While this process is essential for the production of functional antibodies, it is not specifically associated with affinity maturation. Affinity maturation primarily occurs through somatic hypermutation. Option D: VDJ rearrangement is the process by which the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes are assembled from gene segments (V, D, and J segments). This process contributes to the diversity of antibodies but is distinct from affinity maturation. Affinity maturation occurs after VDJ rearrangement and is driven by somatic hypermutation in the variable regions.",

Prozone phenomenon is caused by excessive antibodies in the test system (weak/absent precipitation - false-negative test).

      "explanation": "Wassermann's reaction is an example of a complement fixation test. It is a non-specific test for the diagnosis of syphilis. An antigen combines with its (specific) antibody in the presence of complement, and the antigen-antibody complex adsorbs the complement. This reaction is not visible and requires the use of an indicator (sheep erythrocytes and the specific anti-erythrocyte antibody). Reactive serum with antibodies: Antigen binds with antibodies. Complement binds with antigen-antibody complex. Nonreactive serum without antibodies: Unbound antigen, unbound complement. Hemolysin-sensitized RBCs serve as an indicator. Hemolysin-sensitized RBCs serve as an indicator. RBCs settle into pellet. No lysis. RBCs are lysed by unbound complement. Lysis.",

      "explanation": "The classical pathway of complement is activated by immune complexes or antigen-antibody complexes (antigen bound to IgM or IgG). Lipopolysaccharide of gram-negative bacteria activates the alternative complement pathway. The binding of mannose-binding lectin to mannose residues (on the surfaces of Salmonella, Neisseria, and Listeria) activates the lectin complement pathway. Classical pathway: immune complex activates C1.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "This girl presents with features of hereditary angioedema, which is due to a deficiency of C1 inhibitor. Hereditary angioedema is an autosomal dominant disorder that is more common than complement deficiency states. A deficiency of C1 inhibitor leads to unregulated activation of kallikrein. This increases the production of vasoactive peptides such as bradykinin. It causes episodes of edema affecting the skin and mucosal surfaces, such as the larynx and the gastrointestinal tract. This may result in life-threatening asphyxia or nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea after minor trauma or emotional stress. Note: C1, C2, C4 deficiency - collagen vascular disorders. C5-C8 deficiency - recurrent bacteremia with Neisseria.",
