It can be divided into three types-eumycetomas, actinomycetomas and botryomycosis.Infection follows traumatic inoculation of the organism into the subcutaneous tissue from soil orvegetable sources. Within host tissues, the organisms develop to form compacted colonies (grains)0.5-2 mm in diameter, the color of which depends on the organism responsible. It results intumefactions, deformities and draining sinuses discharging these grains or granules.Laboratory Diagnosis:• A. Direct Examination: The presence of grains in pus collected from draining sinuses or inbiopsy material is diagnostic.• B. Culture Samples should also be cultured, at both 25-30°C and 37°C, on brain-heart infusionagar or blood agar for actinomycetes and on Sabouraud agar (without cycloheximide) for fungi.Treatment:The management of eumycetoma is difficult, involving surgical debridement or excision andchemotherapy. Actinomycetoma on the other hand, responds well to rifampicin in combinationwith sulfonamides or cotrimoxazole.Option A: Actinomadura madurae causes actinomycetoma which would respond to antibiotics.Option B: Sporothrix schenckii causes sporotrichosis which is characterised by lesions along theroute of lymphatics.Option C: Fonsecaea pedrosoi causes chromoblastomycosis which would not have dischargingsinuses.",
