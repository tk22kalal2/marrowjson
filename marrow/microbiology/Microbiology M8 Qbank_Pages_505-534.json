      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with the histopathology showing trophozoites of Giardia lamblia in theduodenal wall is suggestive of giardiasis.Giardia lamblia, also called Giardia duodenalis, is the causative agent of giardiasis. It is the onlycommon pathogenic protozoan found in the duodenum and jejunum of humans.Infection occurs by the ingestion of mature cysts in contaminated water and food andis transmitted by the faeco-oral route.525It is weakly pathogenic in humans. Secretory IgA and IL-6 are responsible for clearing theinfection. Hence, giardiasis usually occurs in immunosuppressed, agammaglobulinemic, ormalnourished individuals.Clinical features:• Diarrhea• Fat malabsorption• Dull epigastric pain•Belching and flatulence•• Iron deficiency and growth stunting.• Stool will have excess mucus and fat but no blood.Detection of antigen by ELISA is more sensitive and specific than microscopy. Entero test is alsoused in the diagnosis.Histopathology of the duodenum reveals several heart-shaped or pear-shaped trophozoites withtwo equally sized nuclei. The small intestinal morphology is usually normal. However, in heavyinfections, there may be villous blunting and intraepithelial infiltrates.Metronidazole/tinidazole/nitazoxanide are the first-line agents in the treatment.The image given below shows a magnified view of the pear-shaped trophozoites of Giardialamblia.OMARROW",

      "explanation": "The given life cycle belongs to Trypanosoma cruzi.T. cruzi is the causative organism of Chagas disease or South American trypanosomiasis. They areintracellular parasites.It passes its life cycle in two hosts- the definitive host is the man and the intermediate host(vector) is reduviid bug or triatomine bugs.Metacyclic trypomastigotes are the infective forms to the man that are found in feces of reduviidbugs. Transmission occurs when mucus membranes, conjunctiva, or wound on the surface of theskin are contaminated by feces of the bug.Inside the definitive host, the trypomastigotes differentiate into intracellular amastigotes. Theamastigotes multiply by binary fission and differentiate into trypomastigotes, which are thenreleased into the bloodstream. These are the infective stage for triatomine bug. No multiplicationoccurs in this stage.Inside the triatomine bug, the trypomastigotes are transformed into epimastigotes and theninto metacyclic trypomastigotes in the hindgut which are excreted in feces.530Note: Amastigote forms resemble the Leishmania spp. and hence they are frequently known asLeishmanial forms. They are found in muscular tissue, nervous tissue, and reticuloendothelialsystem.",

      "explanation": "The given life cycle belongs to Leishmania donovani.The definitive hosts are man, dog, and other mammals and the vector/intermediate host is femalesandfly. Promastigotes are infective forms to man.•L. donovani exists in 2 forms:Amastigote form- in humans and other mammals• Promastigote form- in the sandfly and artificial cultureWhen the infected sandfly bites a person, infectious promastigotes are released into the hostdermis along with the sandfly saliva, which potentiates parasite infectivity.Amastigote form (as shown in the image below) is also known as Leishman-Donovan (LD) body. Itis an intracellular form found inside macrophages, monocytes and reticuloendothelial cells. Itcontains a kinetoplast which consists of a parabasal body and a blepharoplast. Flagellum isabsent.Promastigote form (as shown in the below image) is present in the midgut of the female sandfly.The kinetoplast lies transversely near the anterior end. A single flagellum is seen. It is theinfective form of Leishmania donovani for humans.531",
