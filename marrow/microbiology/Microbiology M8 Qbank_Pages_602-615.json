      "explanation": "Aminopterin is a folate antagonist present in the HAT medium that inhibits the de novo pathwayof nucleotide synthesis. Since myeloma cells cannot use the salvage pathway for nucleotidesynthesis due to the lack of HGPRTase enzyme, they cannot survive in the HAT medium.609Hybridoma technology is a method for producing large numbers of identical antibodies(monoclonal antibodies).Hybridomas are somatic cell hybrids produced by fusing the antibody-forming spleen cells withmyeloma cells.

      "explanation": "The disc diffusion method for antibiotic susceptibility testing is applied in the Kirby-Bauermethod.To perform Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method, a suitable standard dilution of a broth culture ofthe test bacterium is inoculated on the surface of a solid medium (Cation-adjusted Mueller-Hintonagar) as a lawn culture. After drying, various antibiotic discs are placed on its surface. Zones ofinhibition around the disc are recorded and interpreted according to the zone diameters availablein the tables of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. The resultsobtained are qualitative (resistant, sensitive, or partially sensitive).Laboratory testing for antibiotic sensitivity can be done by:• Diffusion method- Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method, Stokes disc diffusion method• Dilution method- broth dilution method, agar dilution method•Combination of diffusion and dilution method- E-test (Epsilometer)The image below shows Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method.611",

It uses fluorescent dyes or specific DNA probes. It is also known as qPCR(Quantitative PCR)• Multiplex PCR- Primers to more than one pathogen are used simultaneously and hence multipleproducts are obtained.612• Nested PCR- It involves the sequential use of two primer sets.
