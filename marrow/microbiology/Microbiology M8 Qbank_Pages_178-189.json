      "options": {
        "A": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The species of mycobacteria being studied here is Mycobacterium bovis. It forms moist, smooth, flat, white colonies on Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) media that break up easily when touched. Mycobacterium bovis belongs to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. It causes tuberculosis-like disease in humans. Lowenstein-Jensen medium is a commonly used, egg-based, selective media for mycobacteria. It contains: \n   • Egg - Provides fatty acids and protein required for metabolism\n   • Malachite green - Prevents the growth of contaminants, making it a selective medium.\n   • Mineral salt solution - Buffer\n   • Glycerol - Source of carbon, favors growth of M. tuberculosis, but not M. bovis. LJ medium without glycerol, which contains pyruvate, is used for culture of M. bovis.\n   • L-asparagine - Nitrogen source\n   Mycobacterium tuberculosis colonies on LJ medium are dry, rough, raised, and irregular with a wrinkled surface. They are creamy white or buff-colored, tenacious, and difficult to emulsify (rough, tough, buff).",

      "explanation": "The given biochemical findings are characteristic of Mycobacterium simiae. Although atypical mycobacteria or non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are usually niacin test negative, some NTM like M. simiae and M. chelonae give a positive niacin test. Mycobacteria can be identified based on their biochemical reactions as follows: The first four tests are used to distinguish between M. tb complex and atypical mycobacteria, while the last four tests are used to distinguish between M. tb and M. bovis.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Hunner's ulcer",

        "D": "Marjolin's ulcer"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Biochemical tests show that M. bovis is catalase weak, peroxidase weak, arylsulfatase negative, niacin negative, and nitrate reductase negative. Mycobacterium ulcerans causes Buruli ulcer. M. ulcerans produces a toxin called mycolactone, which leads to the formation of Buruli ulcer. This is a chronic, debilitating, necrotizing disease of the skin and soft tissue, characterized by the formation of ulcers that progressively enlarge over time if left untreated. The ulcers heal with disfiguring scars. Option A: Hunner's ulcers are seen in a subset of patients with interstitial cystitis. These are areas of inflammation on the bladder wall. Option B: Meleney's ulcer, or post-operative synergistic bacterial gangrene, occurs in immunocompromised individuals following abdominal surgery. It is caused by a synergistic interaction between microaerophilic nonhemolytic Streptococcus and hemolytic aerobic Staphylococcus aureus. Option D: Marjolin ulcer is a rare and aggressive form of squamous cell carcinoma that grows from burns, scars, or poorly healing wounds.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The image shows a fish tank granuloma that is caused by M. marinum. The typical clinical presentation is as a single, small violet papule or nodule confined to one extremity, developing 2-3 weeks after trauma. The nodule may break down to form an indolent ulcer. M. marinum is a natural pathogen of fish and amphibians, which spreads to humans who come into contact with contaminated swimming pools or fish tanks. Other non-tuberculous mycobacteria causing disease in humans include: M. kansasii: disease resembles pulmonary TB; M. scrofulaceum: cervical lymphadenitis; M. avium complex: pulmonary, disseminated TB, especially in AIDS patients; M. fortuitum: nail salon furunculosis. M. paratuberculosis (aka Johne's bacillus) causes Johne's disease in cattle. It is associated with Crohn's disease in humans.",

        "D": "It is cultivated in nine-banded armadillos and foot pads of mice"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The image depicts leonine facies in a patient suffering from leprosy or Hansen's disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It is cultivated in nine-banded armadillos and footpads of mice. M. leprae is a Gram-positive, weakly acid-fast bacillus. Thus, 5% sulfuric acid (option A) is used for decolorization to demonstrate M. leprae's acid-fastness. On microscopy, the bacilli appear bound together in masses called globi, within which they are arranged in a 'cigar bundle' appearance. For leprosy diagnosis, specimens are collected from the nasal mucosa, skin lesions, and earlobes. Nasal smears are collected from the internal septum of the nose. Skin smears are collected from the edges of the lesions (option B) rather than from the centre. Slit skin smears are taken as well. The skin is pinched up tight to minimize bleeding and a cut is made with a scalpel, deep enough to get into the infiltrated layers. This is done over the buttocks, forehead, chin, cheek, and ears (at least 5-6 different areas) (option C).",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The generation time of lepra bacilli is 12-13 days. Generation time, also known as doubling time, is the time it takes for the bacterial population to double. It can also be measured as the time between two cell divisions under optimum conditions. The generation time of different bacilli are given below: Lepra bacilli - 12-13 days on average (may vary from 8-42 days), Tubercle bacilli - 15-20 hours, Coliform bacilli - 20 minutes.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Statements 2, 4, and 5 regarding lepra reactions are correct.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The lepromin test has value as a prognostic test for leprosy. The lepromin, or Mitsuda test, is a method to measure cellular immunity in leprosy. It is a skin test for delayed hypersensitivity to lepra antigens. A bacillary suspension of inactivated M. leprae is injected just under the skin and the induration reaction is measured 3-4 weeks after. It is used to classify leprosy. A negative lepromin test is seen in lepromatous and borderline leprosy. It is negative in children <6 months of age; it may be positive at the end of the 1st year. BCG vaccine is capable of converting a negative lepromin test to a positive.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Mitsuda's reaction is read in the 3rd week, i.e., on the 21st day or 20 days after the day of injection. Lepromin test is a skin test for delayed hypersensitivity to lepra antigens. It is the only method for studying immunity in leprosy. A bacillary suspension of inactivated M. leprae is injected just under the skin. The first reaction to occur is the early reaction of Fernandez, which consists of erythema and induration developing in 24-48 hours. It usually remains for 3-5 days; it is usually poorly defined and carries less significance. The second and more meaningful result is the late reaction of Mitsuda, starting at 1-2 weeks (7-10 days), reaching a peak in three or four weeks, and gradually subsiding over the next few weeks. On the 21st day, if there is a nodule more than 5 mm in diameter, the reaction is said to be positive. Note: The 21st day is 20 days after the day of injection which is counted as the 1st day.",

The leprosy vaccine species was originally called Mycobacterium W (M.w) but was later renamed Mycobacterium indicus pranii. The vaccine is administered via an intradermal route. The dose is 0.1ml. It is divided into two equal doses and given on both arms. Booster doses will be given to maintain the immunity level. These are given only in one arm.",
