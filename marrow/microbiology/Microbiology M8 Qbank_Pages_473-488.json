      "explanation": "Pathogenic varieties of cryptococcus including C. neoformans and C. gattii are laccase positive.They also have ability to grow at 37° C and these factors are used to differentiate them fromnon-pathogenic cryptococci.Cryptococci have been classified into 5 serotypes (A, B, C, D, and AD) based on their capsularpolysaccharide:• Three serotypes fall under Cryptococcus neoformans - A(var. grubii), D(var. neoformans), andAD(a hybrid of serotypes A and D). Although serotype AD is very similar to serotypes A and D, theisolates still comprise a discrete group that can be distinguished.• The serotypes B and C are now considered a different species - Cryptococcus gattii.Niger seed agar is a solid medium used for selective and differential isolationof Cryptococcus neoformans from clinical specimens. C. neoformans and C. gattii produces brown480colonies on this medium due to the formation of melanin. Melanin is produced by laccaseusing caffeic acid as the substrate.The following image shows pigmented colonies of C. gattii growing on niger seed agar.Cryptococcal meningitis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, is an opportunistic infection seen inindividuals with AIDS. Flucytosine and amphotericin B are used in the treatment of thiscondition.",
