      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given case scenario of remittent fever with anemia with a positive Rose Bengal card test is suggestive of brucellosis. Castaneda method for blood culture is used to isolate Brucella sp. In the Castaneda method, blood is inoculated into a bottle of trypticase soy broth or brucella broth in a biphasic blood culture bottle (with liquid and solid media in the same bottle). This method minimizes materials and manipulation, thus reducing the chances of contamination and risk of infection to laboratory workers. Blood cultures are positive in only 30-50% of cases even when repeated samples are tested. B. melitensis and B. suis are isolated more readily than B. abortus. Lab diagnosis of brucellosis is done using the following methods: Blood culture with Castaneda's method - recommended, BACTEC - an automated method. It is faster than Castaneda's method. Serological tests: Standard agglutination test (SAT), ELISA for specific IgG/IgM, Dipstick assays. Detection in milk and infected cattle is carried out by: Microscopic demonstration by staining or immunofluorescence, Milk ring test, Rose Bengal card test.",

This can be caused by Streptobacillusmoniliformis and Spirillum minus.Rat-bite fever (RBF) is characterized by fever, rash, and arthralgia which usually occurs days orweeks after a bite.The two types of rat-bite fever are:• Streptobacillary RBF develops 2-10 days after a rat bite, associated with sudden onset of fever,headache, and myalgia followed by petechial rash and arthritis. It is also called Haverhill fever orErythema arthrititicum epidemicum.•Spirillary RBF is similar to streptobacillary type but it is also associated with regionallymphadenopathy. It is also called Sodoku.Diagnosis is based on demonstration of causative organisms in peripheral blood films. Serologycan also be used for diagnosis.RBF is treated with intravenous Penicillin G. Alternative drugs include ampicillin, cefuroxime,and cefotaxime.Note: Pasteurella multocida causes cellulitis and lymphangitis following bites by cats and dogs.Bartonella henselae causes cat sratch disease and bacillary angiomatosis.Borellia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease.273",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given case scenario of sudden-onset fever with painful lymphadenopathy and a history of similar complaints in the community is suggestive of a diagnosis of plague caused by Yersinia pestis. The septicemic form of the disease may be acquired directly if the bacteria enter the bloodstream via infected blood transfusions. Wild rodents and their infected fleas are the primary reservoirs of Yersinia pestis. Infection is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected fleas. Human plague occurs in three clinical forms (in increasing order of severity): bubonic plague, pneumonic plague, and septicemic plague. Bubonic plague - it is the most common variety of the disease. It is named after the buboes, meaning swollen lymph nodes, which typically develop within a week after an infected flea bite. Other clinical features include sudden onset of fever and chills, headache, and fatigue. Pneumonic plague - bubonic plague can advance and spread to the lungs. It is the most virulent form of plague. Any person with pneumonic plague may transmit the disease via droplets to other humans. The symptoms include dyspnea, chest pain, cough, fever, and hemoptysis. Septicemic plague - when the bacteria enter the bloodstream directly and multiply there, it is known as septicemic plague. When left untreated, both bubonic and pneumonic plague can lead to septicemic plague.",

      "explanation": "This scenario of lesions on the hand followed by axillary lymphadenopathy is suggestive of catscratch disease, hence we should ask about the history of exposure to cats. It is caused byBartonella henselae.Bartonella henselae is an intracellular, pleomorphic, gram-negative bacillus. They can beidentified in lymph node biopsy with Warthin-Starry Silver stain. In addition to cat scratchdisease, in immunocompromised individuals, it can also cause bacillary angiomatosis and peliosishepatis.281In immunocompetent hosts, cat scratch disease is a self limiting illness. However in patients withsevere disease, azithromycin can be used to treat the infection.Cat scratch diseaseBlisters on handMARROWMARROWAxillarylymphadenopathy",

      "explanation": "Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome is an atypical form of cat scratch disease and is caused by Bartonella henselae. Bartonella henselae also causes bacillary angiomatosis in HIV-infected and other immunodeficient patients. It presents as vascular nodules or tumors on the skin, mucosa, and other locations. Bartonella bacilliformis causes Oroya fever, also known as Carrion's disease. Note: Ehrlichia phagocytophila has been renamed as Anaplasma phagocytophilum.",
