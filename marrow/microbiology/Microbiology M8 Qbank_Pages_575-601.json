Infection occurs through penetration ofthe skin by larvae in the soil. Then, they migrate to the small intestine.The larvae molt twice and become adult female worms in the small intestine. The eggs laid in themucosa of the intestine hatch immediately releasing the rhabditiform larva (L1 stage). Theserhabditiform larvae in the bowel can develop directly into filariform larvae that penetrate thecolonic wall or perianal skin and enter the circulation to repeat the migration. This establishesongoing internal reinfection.The rhabditiform larva can be seen on microscopic examination of stool.",

The plugs are colorless.• They float in the saturated salt solution.•It has a triple shell, the outermost layer of which is stained brown.They are commonly transmitted by soil. The eggs passed in the stool areunembryonated. Microscopic identification of the eggs in a stool specimen is diagnostic ofwhipworm infection.In moderate infections of 20 adult worms or less, the worms are confined to the caecum andascending colon. The symptoms include epigastric and lower abdominal pain, diarrhoea (rarelybloody), vomiting, flatulence and distention, weight loss, and increased blood and iron loss.In heavy infections of 200 adult worms or more (trichuriasis dysentery syndrome), the worms arein the distal colon and rectum. The symptoms include bloody diarrhoea with profuse mucus,abdominal pain, tenesmus, weight loss leading to cachexia, severe anemia, and rectal prolapse. Onexamination, clubbing may be present. Blood investigations may show moderate eosinophilia.Chronic infection leads to growth retardation and nutritional deficiencies. Around 0.005 ml ofblood is lost per day per worm. In heavy infections, as much as 4 to 5 ml can be lost per day perworm.Treatment is mebendazole or albendazole.",

      "explanation": "590The given clinical scenario and muscle biopsy showing larvae are suggestive of trichinellosis. It iscaused by Trichinella spiralis.Trichinella spiralis is known as the pork worm since the infection is acquired by consuming rawor undercooked pork. The initial infection presents with diarrhea and abdominal pain. In the laterphase of the infection, the larvae move from the intestines into the circulation and migrate intomuscles where they are encysted. This causes symptoms like fever and myalgia.These larvae are calcified in about 5-6 months. Eosinophilia caused by parasitic infection alsocomes down after 6 months.Detection of spiral larva in muscle tissue is done by performing a muscle biopsy. Deltoid, biceps,gastrocnemius, or pectoralis muscles are usually selected for biopsy..Other parasites that can be demonstrated in a muscle biopsy are:• T. solium• T. cruzi (amastigote)The image below shows Trichinella spiralis larvae within the muscle.",

It has a thintransparent hyaline shell membrane. The ovum is segmented with 4 to 8 blastomeres. There is aclear space between the segmented ovum and eggshell. Eggs float in the saturated salt solution.Humans are infected when filariform larvae in moist soil penetrate the skin or subcutaneoustissue. The larvae are then carried in the venous circulation to the heart and lungs, where theymay cause mild transient pneumonitis or bronchitis. They migrate up the respiratory tract to thepharynx, are swallowed, and reach the small intestine producing epigastric pain, dyspepsia,nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.A. duodenale or N. americanus ingest blood, secrete anticoagulants, and interfere with theabsorption of iron, B12, and folic acid.

The symptoms are due to obstruction oflymphatics by the filarial stage of adult worms.The lymphatic vessels of the male genitalia are most commonly affected in bancroftian filariasis,producing episodic funiculitis, epididymitis, and orchitis. Adenolymphangitis of the extremities isless common.Hydrocele is the most common sign of chronic bancroftian filariasis, followed by lymphedema,elephantiasis, and chyluria. The swelling involves the whole leg, the whole arm, the scrotum, thevulva, or the breast.DEC provocation test is used to demonstrate microfilaria during the day.The image below shows the life cycle of Wuchereria bancrofti.597Mosquito StagesMosquito takesa blood meal(13 larvae enter inHuman Stages8 Migrate to head andmosquito's proboscis6L1 larvaeL3 larvae2Adults in lymphatics3Adults produce sheathedmicrofilariae that migrateMosquito takesinto lymph and bloodchannelsMicrofilariae shed sheaths,pentrate mosquito's midgut,and migrate to thoracic musclesa blood mealngest microfa)A= Infective StageDiagnostic StageThe image below shows the difference between microfilaria of various filarial nematodes.Difference between microfilariafilarial nematodes.NocturnalWuchereria bancroftiiority - Sheathed, the tail-tip free fromCulex and Anopheles mosquito.nucleiBrugia malayNocturnal periodicity - Sheathed, two discrete nuclei,one at extreme tip and the other midway betweenthe tip and posterior column of nuclei- Vector: Mansonia and Aedes mosquito.Teduniaperiodicity- Vector:Loa JoaSheathed. nucleiChrysops (mangoupfly).the tail tipOMARRO \\V",

      "question": "A 54-year-old farmer from Assam presented with the finding shown in the image. He had also developed a painless swelling in his elbow 2 years back, which has gradually been increasing in size. Which of the following is the drug of choice to treat this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Eflornithine",
        "B": "Suramin",
        "C": "Ivermectin",
        "D": "Diethylcarbamazine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario and image showing sclerosing keratitis are suggestive of onchocerciasis (river blindness). The drug of choice is ivermectin. It is caused by Onchocerca volvulus. It is also known as convoluted filaria or blinding filaria. The vector is blackfly (Simulium species), which breed in fast-flowing rivers, and therefore the disease is most common along the course of rivers. Hence, it is also called river blindness. The usual presentation is formation of a subcutaneous nodule or onchocercoma. It is a firm, non-tender nodule arising from bony sites like the scalp, elbow, ribs, and iliac crest. It is associated with pruritus and rashes. The microfilaria in the eyes cause photophobia and gradual loss of vision. The most severe manifestation is sclerosing keratitis and chorioretinitis, which causes blindness. It is the 2nd major infective cause of blindness in the world after trachoma. Suramin and diethylcarbamazine (DEC) were used earlier but are not used nowadays. DEC destroys microfilariae but usually causes a Mazzotti reaction, consisting of pruritus, rash, lymphadenopathy, fever, hypotension, and occasionally, eye damage. Note: Onchocerciasis is not endemic in India, but sporadic cases have been reported from North-Eastern India.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and the image showing Calabar swelling is suggestive of loiasis causedby Loa loa.Calabar swellings are temporary foci of inflammation that appear as Loa loa wanders through thesubcutaneous tissues. They are up to 3 cm in size and are also called fugitive swellings becausethey disappear in a few days only to reappear elsewhere.Loa loa is transmitted by the bite of Chrysops species (deerflies). The infective form is the thirdstage microfilaria. After entry into human skin, it grows into an adult worm.The ocular manifestations occur when the worm reaches the subconjunctival tissue during itswanderings. They include:• Granuloma in bulbar conjunctiva•• Painless edema of the eyelids•Proptosis.The image below shows Calabar swelling.The image below shows a live, adult Loa loa in the anterior chamber of the eye.599",
