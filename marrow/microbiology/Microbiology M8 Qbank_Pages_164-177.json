      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Mycobacteria are acid-fast due to the presence of mycolic acid in their cell walls. On being stained with carbol fuchsin or fluorescent dyes such as auramine-O or rhodamine, they resist decolorization by 20% sulfuric acid and absolute alcohol for 10 minutes. This property is referred to as acid and alcohol fastness and is routinely used to identify mycobacteria. Mycobacterial cell wall structure: Lipoarabinomannan (LAM), capsular proteins and carbohydrates, mycolic acid layer, lipoteichoic acid, arabinogalactan layer, peptidoglycan layer, cytoplasmic membrane.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "NaOH and N-acetylcysteine are used for the digestion and decontamination of sputum used in smear preparation for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Sputum and specimens from non-sterile sites need prior treatment for digestion (to liquefy the thick pus), decontamination (to inhibit the normal flora), and concentration (to increase the yield) before they can be used for testing. Methods used for digestion and decontamination of sputum: • Petroff's method - Uses 4% NaOH and HCl. • N-acetyl cysteine (NALC) + 2% NaOH - NALC liquefies the sputum and NaOH kills the normal flora. This method is better suited for automated culture systems and is superior to Petroff's method. Note: Formalin or hypochlorite can be used only if smear microscopy is being done. They are not useful for culture or animal pathogenicity testing.",

It is a fully automated, real-time nucleic acid amplification technology, with high specificity and sensitivity. The WHO recommends its use worldwide as the initial diagnostic test in adults and children who are presumed to have multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) or HIV-associated TB. Xpert MTB/RIF should also be the first test applied to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients in whom tubercular meningitis is suspected, as well as a replacement test (over conventional microscopy, culture, and histopathology) for gastric lavage, pleural and other biopsies, and fine-needle aspiration specimens.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Disc diffusion method is used for drug susceptibility testing for most bacteria; however, it is not used for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The disc diffusion technique is not suitable for testing Mycobacterium tuberculosis because the organism grows so slowly that the drug has time to diffuse throughout the medium, and sharp zones of inhibition are not seen. Methods used in the drug susceptibility testing of M. tb include: For agar-based methods, 7H10 or 7H11 Middlebrook media are used and only the proportion method can be applied. Radiometric techniques measure the metabolic activity of the bacteria. Based on changes in these values, drug susceptibility can be estimated.

        "D": "All the above assays"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "TB test done on a whole blood sample is the interferon-gamma release assay. It has been used for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis in patients with HIV (who frequently have a negative Mantoux test). Interferon-gamma release assays include: • QuantiFERON-TB Gold • T-SPOT.TB. QuantiFERON-TB Gold quantitates the amount of IFN-y produced by CD4+ T cells in response to the antigens from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT- Plus) is an improved version of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test. QuantiFERON-TB Gold detects only TB-specific CD4+ responses. However, QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus detects both CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses to TB-specific antigens. T-SPOT.TB determines the total number of individual effector T cells expressing IFN-Y. The TrueNat TB test is a new molecular test that can diagnose TB in one hour as well as test for rifampicin resistance. This test uses a sputum sample taken from the patient. Only about 0.5 ml of the sample is required. Gene Xpert is also a molecular method of testing that cannot use blood as a sample. (Option A and B)",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) assay is used for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) antigen is a lipopolysaccharide present in the mycobacterial cell wall, released from metabolically active cells or degenerating cells of patients having tuberculosis. Urine LAM is a useful tool in diagnosing tuberculosis, especially in patients with HIV and low CD4+ T cell count. Most diagnostic tests for tuberculosis rely on sputum samples, which are difficult to obtain and have low sensitivity in immunocompromised patients, patients with disseminated TB, and children, delaying treatment initiation. Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is the only WHO-endorsed TB biomarker that can be detected in urine, an easily collected sample.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Lymph nodes are the most common site of extrapulmonary TB. The diagnosis is established by fine needle aspiration biopsy. In descending order of frequency, the extrapulmonary sites most commonly involved in TB are: lymph nodes, pleura, genitourinary tract, bones and joints, meninges, peritoneum, and pericardium. In less than 50% of these cases, there is associated pulmonary disease.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The scar shown in the image results from the BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) vaccine. The WHO recommends Danish 1331 strain for BCG vaccine production. Normal saline is recommended as the diluent for the BCG vaccine as distilled water is an irritant. The dose administered is 0.1ml containing 0.1mg. It is administered intradermally by using a 26-gauge tuberculin syringe on the left deltoid.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "QuantiFERON-TB Gold is not a type of tuberculin skin test. It is a type of interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), a whole-blood test that can aid in diagnosing Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. There are three described methods for tuberculin skin testing (TST): the Mantoux test, also known as the Pirquet test (preferred method), the Heaf test, and the Tine test. In contrast, IGRAs that have been approved by the FDA are: the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-GIT), the T-SPOT.TB test (T-Spot), and the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus). IGRA is not used in India due to a higher probability of a false positive due to universal BCG vaccination. It can also lead to a diagnosis of active TB in a patient with latent TB and may lead to overtreatment. This test is banned in India after the WHO advised against it in low- and middle-income countries.",
