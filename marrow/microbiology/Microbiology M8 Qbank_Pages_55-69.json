      "question": "A mother brings her 1-year-old child to the hospital with complaints that he turns blue while breastfeeding. It resolves when he assumes a squatting position. On examination, a cleft palate is seen. Labs show hypocalcemia. Which of the following abnormalities is expected to be seen in the lymphoid organs?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Decreased size of germinal centers of lymph nodes",

        "D": "Increased size of the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath of spleen"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Turning blue on breastfeeding with resolution on squatting describes a tet spell or a cyanotic spell, indicating a congenital cardiac defect. Cleft palate, cardiac defects, and hypocalcemia (parathyroid hypoplasia/aplasia) suggest a diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome. In this disorder, a decreased size of paracortical areas of lymph nodes is noted. DiGeorge syndrome is characterized by thymic aplasia, causing a deficiency of T cells and absent cell-mediated immunity. Thus, paracortical areas of lymph nodes and periarteriolar sheaths of the spleen, where T cells reside, are reduced in size. B cells are usually not affected.",

Naive CD4+ T cells are activated when they come into contact with two ligands - MHC class II and a costimulatory membrane protein (e.g., CD28). Both of these are present in antigen-presenting cells, the most potent of which is the mature dendritic cell. Other professional antigen-presenting cells include macrophages and B lymphocytes (option C). Other options: Option B: Follicular dendritic cells are functionally different from dendritic cells.

Nude mice lack body hair, hence the name. They lack a thymus and thus cannot generate mature T lymphocytes. The absence of T-lymphocytes makes them unable to mount adaptive immune responses requiring helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells. The absence of functioning T cells also prevents the rejection of allografts & xenografts.",

      "explanation": "γδ TCR recognize a different type of antigens without the requirement of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Each T cell recognizes a specific bound antigen by means of an antigen-specific T-cell receptor (TCR). The TCR is a heterodimer and is of two types: αβ TCR (95%) recognize peptide antigens that are presented by MHC molecules on the surfaces of antigen-presenting cells. γδ TCR (5%) recognize peptides, lipids, and small molecules, without a requirement for display by MHC proteins. They have particular localization patterns in the mucosal tissues, which protect against microbes that try to enter through epithelia. TCRs are non-covalently bound to six polypeptide chains or three dimers (a γε pair, a δε pair, and a ζ pair), forming the CD3 complex and the ζ dimer.

The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system or complex is a gene complex encoding the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. In humans, the MHC molecules are called human leukocyte antigens (HLA) because they were initially detected on leukocytes by the binding of antibodies. The combination of HLA alleles in each individual is called the HLA haplotype. The function of MHC molecules is to display peptide fragments of protein antigens for recognition by antigen-specific T cells. The HLA system is highly polymorphic. Each individual's HLA alleles differ from those of others. It has to be checked before organ transplantation. The HLA complex consists of 3 separate clusters of genes: • Class I - A, B, and C loci • Class II - DR, DQ, and DP loci • Class III - Complement C2 and C4 of the classical pathway and properdin factor B of the alternate pathway, heat shock proteins (HSP), TNF, and factor B.",

      "explanation": "Red blood cells are anucleated cells that lack MHC class I antigens. MHC class I antigens are present on platelets and all nucleated cells, except sperm cells. They are responsible for the presentation of peptide antigens to CD8 T cells. The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC), or the HLA complex, is a cluster of genes whose products are responsible for antigen presentation to T cells, transplant rejection, etc. The HLA complex of genes is present on the short arm of chromosome 6. The genes are clustered in three regions named MHC region I, II, and III. MHC class II antigens are present only on antigen-presenting cells (macrophages, dendritic cells, B cells). They present the peptide antigen to CD4 T cells. APCs also contain MHC class I antigens. MHC region III comprises genes that code for complement factors like C2, C4, C3 convertase, factor B, and properdin, heat shock protein, tumor necrosis factor, and steroid 21-hydroxylases.",

      "explanation": "CD4+ is a marker of T helper and memory cells. They do not produce immunoglobulins. CD4+ T cells are activated when an antigen-presenting cell expressing MHC-II binds to them. The activated CD4+ T cell differentiates into T helper (TH) cells and regulatory T cells. The TH cells are further differentiated into TH1, TH2, and TH17 cells. Helper T cells have the following functions: • Activation and proliferation of cytotoxic T cells • Regulation of the monocyte-macrophage system. • Activation of B cells to produce plasma cells • Production of interleukins. Memory cells (Tm) have both CD4+ and CD8+ markers. They provide an anamnestic immune response and are thus responsible for immunogenic memory. Immunoglobulins are produced by plasma cells.",

      "explanation": "Natural killer cells (NK cells) act on virus-infected cells with reduced MHC expression. NK cells are a subtype of lymphocytes that kill damaged or infected cells. NK cells express CD16 and CD56. Their action is inhibited when MHC I is expressed on normal cells. This prevents NK cells from killing normal cells. In the presence of a viral infection or malignancy, MHC expression of a cell is reduced. Thus, NK cells get activated and kill virus-infected/tumor cells. NK cells also secrete cytokines (IFN-y) which activate macrophages (option B) for destruction of ingested microbes.

      "explanation": "A child with colicky abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting with eosinophilia likely has a parasitic infection with Ascaris lumbricoides (egg shown in the image). Parasitic infections trigger the release of IL-5. In a parasitic infection, Th2 cells are stimulated and they produce IL-4 and IL-5. IL-4 stimulates the differentiation of B-cells into IgE-secreting plasma cells, while IL-5 stimulates the maturation and release of eosinophils from the bone marrow. The secreted IgE coats the parasite. The activated eosinophils bind to the IgE-coated parasite and kill them through the release of major basic protein.",
