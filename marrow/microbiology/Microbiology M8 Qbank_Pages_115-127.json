      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Gram-positive cocci arranged in clusters that produce golden-yellow pigment on nutrient agar is suggestive of Staphylococcus aureus. The pigment production occurs optimally at 22°C. Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive coccus. On nutrient agar, its colonies are large (2-4 mm in diameter), convex, smooth, shiny, opaque and easily emulsifiable. The colonies appear golden yellow due to the presence of staphyloxanthin (carotenoid). Pigment production occurs optimally at 22°C and in aerobic conditions. It is enhanced when 1% glycerol or milk is incorporated in the medium. On a nutrient agar slope, there is confluent growth of Staphylococcus, which appears as a characteristic oil-paint appearance.",

      "explanation": "Protein A forms the basis of the co-agglutination reaction shown by Staphylococcus aureus. Protein A-bearing staphylococci are coated with IgG antiserum. Protein A binds to the Fc terminal of IgG, leaving the Fab terminal free to combine with its specific antigen. The corresponding antigen is then added to this mixture, which causes agglutination of the bacteria. This is known as the co-agglutination reaction. It is used for streptococcal, gonococcal, or hemophilus typing.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "γ-toxin and Panton-Valentine-toxin (leucocidin) of Staphylococcus aureus are called synergohymenotropic toxins. Synergohymenotropic (synergo - working together, hymenotropic - forming pores) toxins are a family of bicomponent toxins that act through the synergistic activity of 2 non-associated secretory proteins - class F and class S proteins. Gamma hemolysin has two components necessary for its hemolytic action. It is encoded by three genes: HlgA and HlgC (belonging to class S) and HlgB (belonging to class F), resulting in 2 pairs of class S and F components - HlgA and HlgB, or HlgC and HlgB. Panton-Valentine Leucocidin is composed of two components - S and F - encoded by two contiguous and cotranscribed genes, lukS-PV and lukF-PV. It is associated with the majority of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA).",

        "B": "Conjugation",
        "C": "Transduction",
        "D": "Production of β-lactamase"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Infective endocarditis: large irregular masses on the valve cusps. Penicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus is determined by plasmids that are most commonly transferred by transduction. Penicillin resistance in Staphylococci most commonly occurs due to bacterial production of β-lactamase, which inactivates penicillins by splitting their β-lactam ring. These enzymes are inducible and are plasmid-mediated. They confer resistance to penicillin G, ampicillin, piperacillin, etc. The genetic transfer of antibiotic resistance can occur in the following ways: Transformation: after death or cell lysis, some bacteria release their DNA into the environment. Other bacteria, generally of the same species, can come into contact with these free DNA fragments, take them up, and incorporate them into their DNA by recombination. Transduction: this method involves the transfer of DNA, episome, or plasmid from one bacterium to another with the use of a bacteriophage. Conjugation: this mechanism requires the presence of a special plasmid called the F plasmid that codes for the sex pilus. It is the most common method of transfer of antibiotic resistance in most other bacteria. Note: change in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and production of β-lactamases are modes of penicillin resistance seen in S. aureus, but the question asks for methods of transfer of drug resistance.",

      "explanation": "Among the given options, washing hands before and after treating the patients is the most effective way to curb the spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. In addition to this, personnel with active S. aureus lesions and carriers should be excluded from areas having patients at highest risk for severe staphylococcal infections like newborn nurseries, intensive care units, operating rooms, and cancer chemotherapy wards. In such individuals, the application of topical antiseptics such as mupirocin to nasal or perineal carriage sites may diminish the shedding of MRSA.",

Botryomycosis is a rare chronic bacterial granulomatous disease that usually involves the skin and rarely viscera. It is most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus but can also be caused by Pseudomonas, Escherichia coli, Proteus, and Streptococci. Patients present with chronic, suppurative, granulomatous skin lesions like nodules, abscesses, and sinuses. Actinomycetoma, eumycetoma, and botryomycosis are difficult to distinguish clinically but are readily distinguished with microbiologic testing or biopsy. Granules of botryomycosis consist of loose masses of cocci. Organisms can also be seen in wound discharge or histologic specimens.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Vomiting 2 hours after the consumption of food is likely food poisoning by Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylococcus aureus can grow in carbohydrate and protein food sources, producing enterotoxins. There are 15 types, all of which are superantigens. They are preformed toxins that are relatively heat stable. They stimulate the vagus nerve, vomiting centre of the brain and intestinal peristaltic activity. Type A enterotoxin is responsible for most cases of food poisoning. The common sources of infection are the foods that are not cooked after handling. These include sliced meats, puddings, pastries, and sandwiches. Ingestion of such contaminated food causes food poisoning within 30 minutes to 6 hours after consumption.

      "explanation": "Burning micturition and fever with chills in a young woman points to a diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI). The most likely organism implicated here is Staphylococcus saprophyticus, as it is coagulase-negative and novobiocin-resistant. Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a part of the normal flora of human skin and the periurethral area and thus is a common cause of urinary tract infection (UTI) in young women. Staphylococci are Gram-positive cocci. Coagulase/protein A+ is S. aureus. The catalase test is positive for S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, S. hominis, S. lugdunensis, and S. schleiferi. Streptococci are coagulase-negative staphylococci. Novobiocin-susceptible staphylococci include S. epidermidis and S. hominis. Staphylococcus saprophyticus and S. xylosus are novobiocin-resistant. Option A: Staphylococcus aureus is a coagulase-positive bacterium. It is an uncommon cause of UTI. Options B and C: Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus epidermidis are coagulase-negative and novobiocin-sensitive. They are usually considered contaminants if found on urine culture, but they may also cause UTIs in children with underlying urinary tract abnormalities.",

However, they are larger in size and mostly occur in pairs, tetrads or clusters of eight. They form smaller colonies in culture in comparison to S. aureus. Hugh-Leifson oxidation-fermentation test can be used to differentiate between micrococci (oxidative pattern) and staphylococci (fermentative pattern). Micrococci are catalase-positive and modified oxidase-positive. They are ordinarily non-pathogenic but can rarely cause infections in an immunocompromised host.
