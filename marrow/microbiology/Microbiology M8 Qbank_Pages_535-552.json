      "explanation": "The schizont stage is usually not seen in the peripheral smear of individuals having Plasmodiumfalciparum malaria.A mature schizont contains merozoites and hemozoin. This will burst to release merozoites intocirculation. The merozoites invade fresh erythrocytes, in which they go through the same processof development called erythrocytic schizogony or merogony.After the ring form is formed in peripheral blood, the remaining RBC cycle of falciparum occurs inthe capillaries of the brain and other internal organs. Hence only the ring form is seen in theperipheral smear.542However, for other Plasmodium species, all erythrocytic stages occur in peripheral blood vessels.The below image shows the life cycle of Plasmodium spp.Infective StageA Diagnostic StageCDCSAFER HEALTHIER PEOPLEHuman Liver StagesLiver cellInfectedliver cellatDocst10 OokineteMosquito StagesRupturedcocystMicrogamete enteringmacrogameteCRelease ofsporozoitesMosquito takesa blood meal(injects sporozoites)Sporogonic CycleMosquito takesa blood meal(ingests gametocytes)MacrogametocyteExflagellated?microgametocyte\"AExo-erythrocytic CycleRuptured schizontHuman Blood StagesSchizontImmaturetrophozoite(ring stage)BErythrocytic CycleMature,trophozoiteP. falciparumRupturedschizontSchizontGametocytes,GametocytesP. vivaxPovaleP malariae",

      "explanation": "Sabin-Feldman dye test is used for the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis.It is based on the principle that the presence of anti-toxoplasma antibodies in the patient'sserum inhibits the staining of trophozoites by alkaline methylene blue dye.Toxoplasma trophozoites and complement are added to the patient's serum which is thenincubated for an hour at 37°C. After incubation, methylene blue dye is added.If anti-toxoplasma antibodies are present in the serum, these are activated by complement andthe parasite membrane is lysed. Thus, the trophozoites are not stained (positive result).If there are no antibodies, trophozoites will take up the stain and appear blue under themicroscope. This is considered to be a negative result.The dilution of the test serum at which 50% of the tachyzoites are not stained is reported as theantibody titer of the test serum. The test is highly sensitive and specific.It cannot differentiate between recent or past infections as it detects only IgG antibodies.",

      "explanation": "Human toxoplasmosis is a zoonosis. It is transmitted by cats.Toxoplasma gondii has two types of life cycles:• Enteric cycle• Exoenteric cycleThe enteric cycle occurs in definitive hosts such as cats. Exoenteric cycle occurs in intermediatehosts such as humans, mice, rats, etc.546Both asexual reproduction (schizogony) and sexual reproduction (gametogony) occur within themucosal epithelial cells of the small intestine of the cat. The tachyzoites and tissue cyst representstages in asexual multiplication, while the oocyst is formed by sexual reproduction.All three forms, tachyzoites, tissue cyst, and oocyst occur in the definitive host. Only the asexualforms, tachyzoites, and tissue cysts are present in the intermediate host.Tachyzoites continue to multiply and spread locally by the lymphatic system and blood, while thebradyzoites multiply slowly inside the tissue cyst. The dormant bradyzoites inside the cyst may bereactivated on immune suppression causing renewed infection in the host.The below image shows the life cycle of Toxoplasma gondii.Life cycle of Toxoplasma gondiiNIATransmissionthrough theplacentaIntermediate hosts:mammals, birdsBrain, heart,lung, eye,muscles,placenta.Blood flowdisseminationIntestinalcells",

The oocysts are immediately infectious (unlikeisospora oocysts, which require maturation), and may cause autoinfection or be implicated in549person-to-person transmission. Because of their small size (4-5micron), they is difficult to seeusing routine staining.
