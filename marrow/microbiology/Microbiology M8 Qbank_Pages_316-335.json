      "explanation": "The given image shows Treponema pallidum demonstrated by Levaditi's method. Single painlessulcer with indurated base points towards the diagnosis of syphilis.Syphilis is caused by Treponema pallidum, a spirochete bacillus. It is a sexually transmittedinfection. Intrauterine transmission can lead to congenital syphilis.It shows corkscrew motility which can be demonstrated by darkfield microscopy.Treponema can be stained by silver impregnation methods.•Fontana's method is used on smear• Levaditi's method is used for tissue sectionsThe clinical manifestations of syphilis include:Primary syphilis: The typical primary chancre usually begins as a single painless papulethat rapidly becomes eroded and usually becomes indurated, with a characteristic cartilaginousconsistency on palpation of the edge and base of the ulcer.Inguinal lymphadenopathy is bilateral and may occur with anal as well as with genital chancres.The chancre generally heals within 4-6 weeks (range, 2-12 weeks), but lymphadenopathy maypersist for months.Secondary syphilis: The various features include mucocutaneous or cutaneous lesions andgeneralized nontender lymphadenopathy. macular, papular, papulosquamous, and occasionallypustular syphilides. Other features of secondary syphilis include sore throat, fever, weight loss,malaise, anorexia, headache, and meningismus. Ocular findings associated with secondary (orlater/unknown-stage) syphilis include pupillary abnormalities and optic neuritis as well as the325classic iritis or uveitis.Latent syphilis: Early latent syphilis is limited to the first year after infection, whereas late latentsyphilis is defined as that of 1 year's duration (or of unknown duration). T. pallidum may still seedthe bloodstream intermittently during the latent stage, and latent syphilis in a pregnant womaninfect the fetus in utero.mayNeurosyphilis: The major clinical categories of symptomatic neurosyphilis include meningeal,meningovascular, and parenchymatous syphilis.Cardiovascular syphilis: Cardiovascular involvement results in uncomplicated aortitis, aorticregurgitation, saccular aneurysm (usually of the ascending aorta), or coronary ostial stenosis.Congenital syphilis: The earliest manifestations of congenital syphilis include rhinitis, or\"snuffles\"; mucocutaneous lesions, bone changes, including periostitis detectable by x-rayexamination of long bones; hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, anemia, jaundice,thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis.Serologic tests for syphilis recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC):• Screening or diagnosis (RPR or VDRL),•Quantitative measurement of antibody to assess clinical syphilis activity or to monitor responseto therapy (RPR or VDRL)• Confirmation of a syphilis diagnosis in a patient with a reactive RPR or VDRL test (FTA-ABS,TPHA, EIA/CIA)Treatment of syphilis is with 2.4 million units of intramuscular benzathine penicillin.",
