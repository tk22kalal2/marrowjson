      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "This patient has a high-grade fever and is a student, so he presumably spends a lot of time incrowded areas. The above image shows a purpuric rash. This patient's features are seen inmeningococcemia caused by Neisseria meningitidis, which are gram-negative diplococci.The organism enters the body through the nasopharynx by attaching to the epithelial cells withthe help of pili. From the nasopharynx, they enter the bloodstream producing bacteremia, and thesymptoms may resemble upper respiratory tract infection.Fulminant meningococcemia is the severe form, where the patient presents with high-grade feverand hemorrhagic rash. There is thrombosis of several small blood vessels in various organs withperivascular infiltration and petechial hemorrhages. Some patients with fulminantmeningococcemia may also develop disseminated intravascular coagulation, and circulatorycollapse, a condition known as Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome.",

      "explanation": "Infection with Neisseria meningitidis is most commonly asymptomatic colonization in thenasopharynx of healthy individuals. Hence, a nasopharyngeal swab is used in the detection ofcarriers. In some patients, local inflammation ensues with rhinitis and pharyngitis.Ceftriaxone as a single-dose IV/IM injection is highly (97%) effective in the eradication of carrierstate and can be used at all ages and also in pregnancy. Ciprofloxacin is also highly effective andcan be given orally, but it is not recommended in pregnancy and below 18 years of age.291",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Polysaccharide vaccines of Neisseria meningitidis do not offer protection against group B meningococci. This is because the group B capsule is made up of sialic acid residue, which is also expressed on the surface of neural cells in the fetus. So, the B polysaccharide is perceived as 'self' and is poorly immunogenic. To overcome this issue and provide protection against group B meningococci, a new vaccine was developed based on the surface protein, i.e., non-capsular antigen of serogroup B meningococci. This is the multicomponent meningococcal vaccine - 4CMenB. Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines developed based on capsular antigen can be classified as: Plain polysaccharide vaccines: Bivalent (A and C), Trivalent (A, C, and W-135), Tetravalent (A, C, Y, and W-135). Conjugated polysaccharide vaccines: Monovalent (A or C), Quadrivalent (A, C, Y, and W-135) MenQuadfi vaccine.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The clip given shows a positive Kernig's sign. This, in combination with the other clinical features, indicates a diagnosis of meningococcal meningitis. Third-generation cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime, are used empirically for the initiation of treatment for suspected meningococcal meningitis. These drugs are administered as they also cover the various other potentially penicillin-resistant bacteria that may produce clinical features similar to those of meningococcal meningitis, like penicillin-resistant pneumococcus. Also, some instances of reduced meningococcal sensitivity to penicillin have also been reported. Both meningococcal meningitis and meningococcal septicemia are conventionally treated for 7 days, although courses of 3-5 days may be equally effective. Rifampicin can be used for prophylaxis for close contacts. Ceftriaxone can also be used for chemoprophylaxis, especially in pregnant individuals.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and rifampicin can be used for chemoprophylaxis of meningococcal meningitis. Ciprofloxacin should not be given in pregnancy and to those below 18 years of age. Ceftriaxone is preferred in these cases as a single IM or IV dose. However, reduced susceptibility of isolates to ceftriaxone has occasionally been reported. Recommended chemoprophylaxis for high-risk close contacts of meningococcal meningitis: Age < 1 month: Drug - Rifampicin 5 mg/kg, Dose - Oral every 12 hours for 2 days. Age > 1 month and < 15 years: Rifampicin 10 mg/kg, Oral every 12 hours for 2 days. Ceftriaxone 125 mg, IM single dose, can be given to children and is recommended in pregnancy. Age > 15 years: Ceftriaxone 250 mg, IM single dose, can be given to children and is recommended in pregnancy. Age > 18 years: Ciprofloxacin 500 mg, Oral single dose.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given slide shows Gram-negative diplococci within the polymorphs, characteristic of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. Neisseria is not an obligate intracellular organism, it can also occur extracellularly, i.e., it is a facultative intracellular organism. The other Neisseria that are found as normal inhabitants of the human respiratory tract occur extracellularly. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a Gram-negative, non-sporulating, non-motile diplococcus that is aerobic but may grow anaerobically also. It is oxidase and catalase-positive. Although Neisseria are non-motile organisms, they show twitching motility. This is a flagella-independent form of bacterial translocation over moist surfaces that occurs by the extension and retraction of polar type IV pili. These pili act as virulence factors by promoting attachment to host cells and inhibiting phagocytosis. Virulence factors for gonococci: • Outer Membrane Proteins (OMPs) • IgA proteases • Pili • Lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS) • Transferrin • Lactoferrin-binding protein",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Gonorrhea in males most commonly manifests as acute urethritis. In males, the disease starts as acute urethritis. This infection may extend along the urethra to involve the prostate, seminal vesicles, and epididymis. Chronic urethritis may lead to stricture formation. The infection may also spread to the periurethral tissues, causing abscesses and multiple discharging sinuses (watercan perineum). In females, the initial infection involves the cervix, uterus, and urethra, which may extend to Bartholin glands, endometrium, and fallopian tubes. The vaginal mucosa is not usually affected in adults because the stratified squamous epithelium is resistant to infection by the cocci, and also because of the acidic pH of vaginal secretions. Pelvic inflammatory disease and salpingitis may lead to sterility. Rarely, peritonitis may develop with perihepatic inflammation (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome), which may also occur following Chlamydia trachomatis infection.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario is suggestive of gonococcal urethritis caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Thayer-Martin and modified Thayer-Martin media are used for the culture of this organism. Gonorrhoea may manifest as mucopurulent genital discharge which can be described as resembling 'flow of seed' (semen). Thayer-Martin medium contains vancomycin, colistin, and nystatin. Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease caused by N. gonorrhoeae. The major symptoms include urethritis, vaginal discharge, dyspareunia, and dysuria. In the laboratory diagnosis of N. gonorrhoeae, the discharge on Gram's stain reveals gram-negative intracellular diplococci within phagocytes. It acidifies glucose but not maltose in serum sugars. Stuart's medium is used for transport while Thayer-Martin agar is used as a selective medium used to isolate N. gonorrhoeae. Cultures can be obtained from chocolate agar or Mueller-Hinton agar. Stuart's medium is the transport media used for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitides. It is a semisolid, non-nutrient medium. Charcoal present in the medium neutralizes certain bacterial inhibitors while a reducing agent prevents oxidation.",

Option B: In males, it can involve the rectum, prostate, and epididymitis, but it never involves the testes. Option D: The rising minimum inhibitory concentration of cefixime worldwide has led the CDC to discontinue its recommendation of this agent as first-line treatment for uncomplicated gonorrhea. Third-generation cephalosporins have remained highly effective as single-dose therapy for gonorrhea. Ceftriaxone (250mg, IM) single dose + azithromycin 1g PO, single dose, or doxycycline 100mg PO BD for 7 days is given.
