These viruses use RNA replicaseor RNA-dependent RNA polymerase during genome replication.In positive-stranded RNA viruses, the viral RNA itself acts as mRNA.In negative-stranded RNA viruses, the polarity is opposite that of mRNA. So the genome requiresRNA-dependent RNA polymerase to synthesize their mRNA.Examples of negative-stranded RNA viruses (Mnemonic: Always bring da polymerase or fail toreplicate):• Arenaviruses•• Bunyaviruses• Deltaviruses• Paramyxoviruses• Orthomyxoviruses• Filoviruses• Rhabdoviruses",
