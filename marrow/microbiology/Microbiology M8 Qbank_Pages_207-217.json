      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Acute onset of symptoms (fever, abdominal cramps) with dysentery (bloody mucopurulent stools) and tenesmus is most likely due to Shigella dysenteriae. Shigella dysenteriae is a Gram-negative bacillus causing bacillary dysentery in humans. It is spread through faeco-oral transmission. Other options: Option A: Vibrio cholerae results in watery diarrhea with characteristic rice-water stools. Option B: Viruses such as rotavirus and norovirus cause watery diarrhea through mucosal irritation. Option D: Entamoeba histolytica results in a gradual onset of symptoms usually 1-3 weeks with dysentery.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Shiga toxin acts by inhibiting protein synthesis. Shiga toxin or verotoxin is an exotoxin produced by Shigella species. It consists of two subunits, A and B. The B subunit binds to globotriaosylceramide receptors on the target cell, and then the A subunit gets internalized. The A subunit leads to inhibition of the 60S ribosome, leading to a shutdown of protein synthesis. Its site of action is in the endothelial cells of small blood vessels of the GIT.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Enteric fever is caused by S. typhi or S. paratyphi. The minimum amount of S. typhi required to cause enteric fever is 10^3 to 10^6 organisms. Enteric fever spreads through the feco-oral route. It presents with step-ladder fever and abdominal pain after an incubation period of 10–20 days. Over the next week, the patient can develop abdominal distension, diarrhea, splenomegaly, and characteristic rose spots on the abdomen due to vasculitis. The amount of pathogen required to cause an infection in the host is known as the infectious dose.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given image shows Rose spots. The combination of this with fever, splenomegaly, presence of longitudinal ulcers in the intestine, and intestinal perforation is suggestive of enteric fever. The term enteric fever includes typhoid fever caused by Salmonella typhi and paratyphoid fever caused by Salmonella paratyphi A, B, and C. Enteric fever presents with step-ladder pyrexia. The fever is accompanied by relative bradycardia, which is known as the Faget sign. Hepatosplenomegaly is a common finding on examination. Rose spots that fade on pressure appear on the skin during the second or third week. Since bile is a good culture medium for the bacilli, they multiply abundantly in the gallbladder and are discharged continuously into the intestine. In the intestine, it causes inflammation and necrosis, leaving behind the characteristic typhoid ulcers, which are oriented along the axis of the intestine (longitudinal ulcers). Ulceration of the bowel leads to two major complications: intestinal perforation and hemorrhage. Option B: In intestinal tuberculosis, ulcers are perpendicular to the axis of the intestine (transverse ulcers). Option C: Flask-shaped ulcers are characteristic of amoebiasis. Option D: Hemorrhagic colitis is caused by Shigella dysenteriae and some strains of E. coli. It is characterized by bloody diarrhea with tenesmus.",

      "question": "While evaluating a patient suspected to have enteric fever, you order a widely used tube agglutination test in the second week of his illness. Which of the following statements regarding this test is false?",
      "options": {
        "A": "H agglutinin titer > 160 and O agglutinin titer > 80 is considered significant",
        "B": "O antibody cannot differentiate between Salmonella types.",
        "C": "O antibody lasts longer and hence is not indicative of recent infection.",
        "D": "High titer value in a single test is not confirmative."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The tube agglutination test, which is widely used for the diagnosis of enteric fever, is the Widal test. The O antibodies detected via this test disappear within a few weeks of disease resolution and so are indicative of recent infection. The Widal test is a serological test for the measurement of O and H antigens of Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi present in the patient's serum. Four antigens are used: O antigens of S. typhi (TO), H antigens of S. typhi (TH), H antigens of S. paratyphi A (AH), and H antigens of S. paratyphi B (BH). Paratyphoid O antigens cross-react with the typhoid O antigen due to the sharing of factor 12. It is not used in the test, and thus, O antibody cannot differentiate between Salmonella types. H agglutinin titer > 160 and O agglutinin titer > 80 is considered significant. However, a 4-fold rise in titers between the 1st and 3rd week is more significant compared to a single high titer because of the possibility of an anamnestic reaction - a transient rise of titer due to unrelated infections (malaria, dengue) in persons who had a prior enteric fever. After one week interval, if the titer increases, it indicates true infection. If the titer decreases, it indicates an anamnestic reaction.",

        "D": "Blood culture is the gold standard of diagnosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Widal results showing titers for O antibody >80 and H antibody for S. typhi to be >160 is suggestive of enteric fever. Faget's sign is seen in enteric fever. Enteric fever, caused by Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi A, B, and C, presents with stepladder pyrexia. The fever rises one day and falls the subsequent morning. It continues to form peaks and troughs. Hepatosplenomegaly is a common finding on examination. Rose spots that fade on pressure appear on the skin during the second or third week. Faget's sign is the unusual pairing of fever with bradycardia (relative bradycardia) instead of tachycardia. It is also observed in yellow fever, brucellosis, and tularemia. Intestinal perforation (option A) is a complication of enteric fever caused by Salmonella typhi. It occurs in the 3rd week following infection. The Widal test is a serological test used for the diagnosis of enteric fever during the 2nd week. It measures the levels of H and O antigens in the patient's serum. Bone marrow culture is the gold standard (option D) for diagnosis of enteric fever. Blood culture is most commonly performed to confirm the diagnosis; however, bone marrow is more sensitive. H antigen (flagellar antigen) shows fluffy/woolly agglutination, whereas O antigen (somatic antigen) shows granular agglutination. Appear late and persist for longer duration: H antigen. Appear early and persist for shorter duration: O antigen. Dreyer's tube (conical bottom) and Felix tube (round bottom) are used.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Blood culture",

        "C": "Stool culture",
        "D": "Urine culture"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Bone marrow culture is preferred at this stage. Bone marrow culture is the most sensitive test (>80% sensitivity) for diagnosis of enteric fever. It remains positive for up to 5 days after starting antibiotics, unlike blood culture. Hence, it is preferred in the patient above who has been on antibiotics for 2 days. Blood culture has a sensitivity of about 60% for diagnosis of enteric fever. Its sensitivity drops with duration of illness, and is thus useful only during the 1st week of enteric fever. It rapidly becomes negative on treatment with antibiotics. Stool culture has a sensitivity of 30% and only yields positive results from the 2nd or 3rd week onwards. Urine culture has low sensitivity and may be positive only after the 2nd week. Note: The sensitivity of diagnostic methods for enteric fever is duodenal content culture > bone marrow culture > blood culture. However, duodenal content culture is rarely done in clinical practice.",

      "explanation": "Vi capsule polysaccharide antigen is a heat-labile antigen used in the Vi capsular polysaccharide vaccine (ViCPS) for typhoid. Vi antigen is found in Salmonella typhi, S. paratyphi C, and S. dublin. It is a capsular antigen and is a polysaccharide. It acts as a virulence factor by inhibiting phagocytosis and resisting complement activation and bacterial lysis. It envelopes the O antigen, and thus, many S. typhi strains fail to agglutinate with O antiserum. However, it can be destroyed by heat. It is alcohol stable. This antigen is poorly immunogenic. The Vi capsular polysaccharide vaccine (Vi CPS) contains purified Vi polysaccharide. It is given as a single dose of 0.5ml intramuscularly to children over 2 years of age.

Nontyphoidal salmonellosis refers to illnesses caused by all serotypes of Salmonella except for Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi A, B, and C. Transmission of nontyphoidal salmonellosis occurs usually through the consumption of food or water contaminated with animal feces. Transmission may also occur through food products, especially eggs, poultry, undercooked ground meat, and hence multiple animals act as reservoirs for non-typhoidal salmonella. Gastroenteritis is the most common clinical presentation of NTS. The illness usually lasts 4-7 days, and most people recover without treatment. Culturing organisms continues to be the mainstay of clinical diagnostic testing for nontyphoidal salmonella infection. Approximately 90% of isolates are obtained from routine stool culture until 4-5 weeks after infection.",
