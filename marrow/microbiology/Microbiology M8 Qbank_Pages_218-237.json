      "explanation": "Vibrio cholerae are classified based on O antigen, under the Sakazaki typing scheme. Based on the presence or absence of O antigen, V. cholerae is classified as O1, which agglutinate with antisera to the O1 group (agglutinable vibrios), and non-O1, which do not agglutinate with antisera to the O1 group (non-agglutinable vibrios). As per the Gardner and Venkatraman classification, Vibrios are classified into Group A (V. cholerae) and Group B (others) based on H antigen or flagellar antigen. Gardner and Venkatraman classification: Gardner and Venkatraman Classification - Groups, Subgroups/serogroups/serovars, O1, Biotypes, Classical, Serotypes, Ogawa, V. cholerae, Vibrio, Other Vibrio spp., O139, Non O1/O139 (O2 to O200), El Tor, Inaba, Hikojima.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Non-agglutinable vibrios are non-pathogenic (except O139) and hence, they are called non-cholera vibrios. The vibrios that are not agglutinated by O-1 antiserum are called non-agglutinable (NAG) vibrios. They belong to the serogroups O2-O200, of which only serogroup O-139 is known to cause epidemics of cholera. They are similar to Vibrio cholerae in most biochemical reactions and culture characteristics, except that they are hemolytic to sheep erythrocytes and give a positive Voges-Proskauer reaction.",

      "options": {
        "A": "It is known as the methyl red test",
        "B": "A nitrosoindole compound is formed giving it the red color",

        "D": "The red color is obtained due to acid and gas production by Vibrio"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The test described here is the 'cholera red reaction' given by Vibrio cholera. When a few drops of concentrated sulfuric acid are added to a 24-hour peptone water culture, a reddish-pink color develops due to the formation of nitrosoindole. Vibrio cholerae reduce nitrates to nitrites and convert tryptophan to indole. These two properties contribute to the cholera red reaction. The methyl red (MR) test is used to detect the production of sufficient acid during the fermentation of glucose by bacteria. It is used to classify Enterobacteriaceae. Vibrio cholera does not produce any colored pigment. Vibrio ferments carbohydrates leading to production of acid but no gas.",

      "explanation": "The given case scenario of passing profuse rice-water stools with similar complaints in the family suggests a probable diagnosis of cholera. The test shown in the above image is the string test, and it is performed to identify Vibrio cholerae. To perform the string test, a loopful of the bacterial culture is mixed with a drop of 0.5% sodium deoxycholate in saline on a slide. The bacterial cells of Vibrio cholerae are lysed by sodium deoxycholate, causing the suspension to lose its turbidity and become mucoid. A string is formed when the loop is drawn away from the suspension. Note: The duodenal string test refers to the Entero test performed for the diagnosis of giardiasis.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The disruption of zonula occludens is responsible for watery diarrhea in cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae. Zonula occludens toxin (Zot) is an enterotoxin elaborated by Vibrio cholerae that increases intestinal permeability by interacting with a mammalian cell receptor with subsequent activation of intracellular signaling leading to the disassembly of the intercellular tight junctions. Mechanism of action of cholera toxin: The cholera toxin molecule consists of 1 A and 5 B subunits. The B (binding) units attach to the GM1 ganglioside receptors on the surface of jejunal epithelial cells. The A (active) subunit, on being transported into the enterocyte, dissociates into A1 and A2. A2 fragment only links biologically active A1 to the B subunit. A1 causes prolonged activation of cellular adenylate cyclase and accumulation of cAMP, leading to outpouring into the small intestinal lumen, of large quantities of water and electrolytes. This leads to watery diarrhea which is isotonic with plasma but contains much more potassium and bicarbonate. The toxin also inhibits the intestinal absorption of sodium and chloride. All clinical manifestations and complications in cholera result from the massive water and electrolyte depletion thus caused.",

      "explanation": "Vibrio cholerae possesses lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O antigen, but it plays no role in the pathogenesis of cholera. It is responsible for the immunity induced by killed vaccines. Factors involved in virulence of Vibrio cholerae: â€¢ In the small intestine, vibrios can cross the protective layer of mucus and reach the epithelial cells by using mucinase and other proteolytic enzymes. â€¢ Toxin co-regulated pilus (TCP) is essential for the adhesion to the epithelial surface and colonization of the bacteria in the small intestine. â€¢ Cholera toxin (also known as choleragen and cholera enterotoxin) causes watery diarrhea through a cAMP-mediated pathway.",

      "explanation": "The given case scenario of an organism that caused food poisoning due to contaminated seafood, in addition to the cultural characteristics, is suggestive of food contamination by Vibrio parahaemolyticus. It is a capsulated organism. V. parahaemolyticus is an enteropathogenic halophilic vibrio that is an important cause of food poisoning throughout the world. It inhabits the coastal seas, where it is found in shrimps, crabs, and oysters. It forms opaque green colonies with a raised centre and flat translucent periphery on TCBS agar, unlike V. cholera, which forms yellow colonies. Pathogenic strains show hemolysis on Wagatsuma agar, which is known as the Kanagawa phenomenon. This can be used as a test for pathogenicity.

      "explanation": "The given case scenario is suggestive of a duodenal ulcer caused by Helicobacter pylori. The urea breath test is the most sensitive test for the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection. To perform this test, the patient drinks a urea solution labeled with radioactive carbon-14. The patient then blows into a tube. If H. pylori urease is present, the urea is hydrolyzed, and labeled carbon dioxide is detected in breath samples. The sensitivity of the urea breath test is >90%.",
