      "explanation": "Mean arterial pressure is diastolic + 1/3rd pulse pressure.The mean pressure is the average pressure throughout the cardiac cycle. It is not equal to theaverage of systolic and diastolic pressure because, at normal heart rates, a greater fraction of thecardiac cycle is spent in diastole than in systole. The mean arterial pressure is thereforedetermined by about 60 percent by the diastolic pressure and 40 percent by the systolic pressure.Mean BP= DBP + 1/3 Pulse pressure= DBP +1/3(SBP- DBP)= (3DBP+SBP- DBP)/3= 2/3 DBP + 1/3 SBP",

      "explanation": "There is a decreased firing from the baroreceptors.• When a person stands up from a lying down position, it causes pooling of the blood in the legs,due to gravity. This reduces the venous return and causes a decrease in cardiac output.•Reduced cardiac output, leads to a fall in blood pressure, which in turn causes reduced firingfrom baroreceptors.• As a result, the vagal tone is suppressed leading to increased heart rate.555",
