Thearea between two Z-lines is called sarcomere.The thick filaments, which are about twice the diameter of the thin filaments, are made up ofmyosin, which are lined to form A bands; the thin filaments are made up of actin, tropomyosin,and troponin. The array of thin filaments extends out of the A band and into the less densestaining I bands.The lighter H bands in the center of the A bands are the regions where, when the muscle isrelaxed, the thin filaments do not overlap the thick filaments. The Z lines allow for anchoring ofthe thin filaments.Actinin, titin and desmin are additional structural proteins.Titin connects Z-lines to the M lineand provides the scaffolding to the sarcomere. Desmin adds structure to Z-lines by connectingZ-line to plasma membrane.143Note: Some sources say that even titin is a component of Z-disc so if alpha actinin is not given inthe options titin is the second best answer.BandHZoneRelaxedContractedBandCapZ-Titingee-Z-diskgeMyosinheadMyosintailActinfilamentomeoneM-line",

Myosin heads can now bind to actin andform so-called cross-bridges.When a head attaches to an active site, this attachment simultaneously causes profound changesin the intramolecular forces between the head and arm of its cross-bridge. This causes the head totilt toward the arm and to drag the actin filament along with it. This tilt of the head is called thepower stroke.Immediately after tilting, the head then automatically breaks away from the active site.Formation of cross-bridges is associated with hydrolysis of ATP and generation of force.145The active site on actin isO exposed as Ca2+ bindstroponin.TroponinActive siteMyosin headThe myosin head formsa cross-bridge with actin.During the power stroke.the myosin head bends.and ADP and phosphateare released.4A new molecule of ATPattaches to the myosinhead, causing thecross-bridge to detach.ATP hydrolyzes to ADPand phosphate, whichreturns the myosin to the\"cocked\" position.Ca2+ TropomyosinADPADPADPActin",

Only statement 3 is correct.Excitation contraction coupling refers to the process by which the membrane depolarization of themuscle fibre (excitation) leads to the contraction of the muscle.The steps of excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle are as follows:•Motor-neuron discharge causes the release of acetylcholine at the motor endplate, which bindsto the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.• This causes increased Na+ and K+ conductance in the endplate membrane, leading to thegeneration of end-plate potential, which is a local potential.• When the local endplate potential reaches a threshold for the muscle fibre, and an actionpotential is generated.• The generated action potential passes inward through the T tubules, leading to the spread ofdepolarisation.• The depolarization of the muscle fibre causes the release of Ca2+ from terminal cisterns ofsarcoplasmic reticulum and diffusion to thick and thin filaments.158• The calcium released, binds to troponin C, uncovering myosin-binding sites on actin.•• The formation of cross-linkages between actin and myosin and sliding of thin on thick filamentscauses contraction of the skeletal muscle.Steps in relaxation:The cytoplasmic calcium is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, by the action ofSERCA (sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase).• Once the calcium concentration is lowered, the interaction between actin and myosin ceases, andthe muscle relaxes.Other options:Statement 1: Incorrect - Extracellular calcium levels play an important role in muscle contraction.When there is a decrease in extracellular calcium as in hypocalcemia, the voltage-gated sodiumchannels are activated, which causes sodium influx. The increased intracellular sodiumconcentration causes sustained depolarization, which may lead to tetany.Statement 2: Incorrect - Ca2+ is not released from mitochondria. It is released from thesarcoplasmic reticulum.Statement 4: Voltage-gated calcium channels on T-tubules (part of sarcolemma) are activated by adepolarizing stimulus, which causes the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

The Z lines allow for anchoring ofthe thin filaments.Actinin, titin and desmin are additional structural proteins.Titin connects Z-lines to the M lineand provides the scaffolding to the sarcomere. Desmin adds structure to Z-lines by connectingZ-line to plasma membrane.143Note: Some sources say that even titin is a component of Z-disc so if alpha actinin is not given inthe options titin is the second best answer.BandHZoneRelaxedContractedBandCapZ-Titingee-Z-diskgeMyosinheadMyosintailActinfilamentomeoneM-lineSolution to Question 12:The side-by-side relationship between the myosin and actin filaments is maintained by a largenumber of filamentous molecules of a protein called titin.Titin is a filamentous and springy protein. These springy titin molecules act as a framework thatholds the myosin and actin filaments in place so that the contractile machinery of the sarcomerewill work.One end of the titin molecule is elastic and is attached to the Z disk, acting as a spring andchanging length as the sarcomere contracts and relaxes. The other part of the titin moleculetethers it to the myosin thick filament.Myosin (thick filament)M lineTitinwwwwwwwwwwwwKickerianvaprapro)wwwwwwwwwwwwActin (thin filament)144Z discSolution to Question 13:Titin binds M line to Z lineOther optionsDesmin binds Z line to sarcolemma ( not sarcoplasmic reticulum)Actinin binds Z line to actin (not M line; in fact, one of the two attachments of actin, desmin andtitin, is always Z line)Titin binds M line to z line, forms scaffolding, is responsible for muscle elasticity, is the largestknown protein (Largest protein - titin; Largest gene - Dystrophin; Most abundant protein -Collagen)The length of myosin or actin does not change with contraction; actually, the length of zones I andH get changed (i.e, gets decreased)Solution to Question 14:Sliding of thin filament over thick filament (cross bridge formation) reduces the length of I and Hband.•• During contraction, the Z lines come closer to each other reducing the length of the sarcomere.•The A band remains constant and M line becomes prominent.Solution to Question 15:When the action potential reaches the muscle fiber, there is influx of Ca2+ ions. This Ca2+ bindsto troponin C and tropomyosin is moved out of the way. Myosin heads can now bind to actin andform so-called cross-bridges.When a head attaches to an active site, this attachment simultaneously causes profound changesin the intramolecular forces between the head and arm of its cross-bridge. This causes the head totilt toward the arm and to drag the actin filament along with it. This tilt of the head is called thepower stroke.Immediately after tilting, the head then automatically breaks away from the active site.Formation of cross-bridges is associated with hydrolysis of ATP and generation of force.145The active site on actin isO exposed as Ca2+ bindstroponin.TroponinActive siteMyosin headThe myosin head formsa cross-bridge with actin.During the power stroke.the myosin head bends.and ADP and phosphateare released.4A new molecule of ATPattaches to the myosinhead, causing thecross-bridge to detach.ATP hydrolyzes to ADPand phosphate, whichreturns the myosin to the\"cocked\" position.Ca2+ TropomyosinADPADPADPActinSolution to Question 16:A feature of the myosin head that is essential for muscle contraction is that it functions as anadenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) enzyme.Chemical Events during Muscle Contraction•Before contraction begins, the heads of the cross-bridges bind with ATP. The ATPase activity ofthe myosin head immediately cleaves the ATP but leaves the cleavage products, ADP plusphosphate ion, bound to the head. (Point",
