      "explanation": "Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) of pain relief is based on the gate theory ofpain. This method uses electrodes to activate A° and Aẞ fibers near the injury to relieve pain.Gate control theory operates at the substantia gelatinosa of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.222The relief may result from inhibition of pain pathways (Inhibition of C fibers and A-delta fibers) inthe dorsal horn gate, by stimulation of large-diameter touch-pressure afferents(A-beta fibers). Thisis called the gate-control hypothesis.Interesting clinical application: Touching or shaking an injured area decreases the pain due to theinjury. Stimulation with an electric vibrator at the site of pain also gives some relief.The same mechanism is probably responsible for the efficacy of counterirritants. Stimulation ofthe skin over an area of visceral inflammation produces some relief of the pain due to the visceraldisease.
