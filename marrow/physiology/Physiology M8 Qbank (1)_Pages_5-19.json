      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Feedback regulation is seen in the increased heart rate in response to a decrease in bloodpressure. This is because, in feedback regulation, the homeostatic response (increased heart rate)occurs after the change (decrease in blood pressure) has occurred.On the other hand, in feedforward regulation, the homeostatic responses take place before thechange has occurred. This is done in anticipation of the change to minimize fluctuations.Examples of feedforward regulation include:•The increased heart rate that occurs in an athlete just before a sprint begins.• The smell of food triggers the secretion of salivary and gastric juices.• An increase in insulin before glucose absorption has raised blood glucose levels.",

      "explanation": "Positive feedback is seen in all except gastric secretion. It is under negative feedback control.Negative feedback consists of certain changes that affect a deficient or excessive variable to pull itback to a certain mean value to maintain homeostasis. Most processes in the body are undernegative feedback. For example, an increase in gastric acids leading to a decrease in gastricsecretion.Positive feedback consists of changes that affect a variable to push it further away from a certainmean value. For example, an increase in LH leading to a further increase in LH. Instances, wherepositive feedback plays an important role are:•Clotting of blood• Calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum•LH Surge• Action potential• Shock• Parturition",
