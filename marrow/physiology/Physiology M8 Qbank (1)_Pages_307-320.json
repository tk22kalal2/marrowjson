They are both excitatory (glutamate) and theyboth terminate in the striatum.The two major outputs of the basal ganglia are from GPi and substantia nigra. Both are inhibitory(GABAergic) and both project to the thalamus.From the thalamus, there is an excitatory (glutamatergic) projection to the prefrontal andpremotor cortex.
