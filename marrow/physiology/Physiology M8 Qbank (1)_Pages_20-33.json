      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Thyroxine crosses the plasma membrane for its action.Thyroid hormones enter the nucleus and bind to thyroid hormone receptors. Thehormone-receptor complex in the nucleus binds to DNA via zinc fingers. This increases theexpression of a variety of different genes that code for proteins regulating cell function. Althoughthyroxine is an AA derivative, there are transporters to move it into the cell, hence they areintracellular receptors acting on the nucleus.Epinephrine, glucagon, and insulin bind to cell surface receptors.",

      "explanation": "26Cortisol is not stored before release.Usually, the polypeptide and protein hormones such as insulin, thyroxine or renin are stored insecretory vesicles before release. They are synthesized as much larger polypeptide chains(preprohormones) that are biologically inactive and then processed intracellularly by specificproteases to yield the final hormone molecule which is stored in the secretory vesicle until needed.On the other hand, steroid hormones such as cortisol are synthesised as needed and are notstored. They are lipid soluble and easily diffuse across cell membrane to enter the interstitial fluidand then blood.",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Downregulation of receptors occurs due to internalisation, inactivation of receptors ordesensitisation.A decrease in the level of stimulating hormones generally leads to an increase in the level of activereceptors. This is called upregulation of receptors.On the other hand, an increase in the level of stimulating hormones generally leads to a decreasein the level of active receptors. This is called downregulation of receptors.Downregulation of receptors can occur by one of the following mechanisms:•• Desensitisation - Receptors undergo chemical modifications that make them less responsive.• Internalisation - It is the temporary sequestration of the cell membrane receptors to the inside ofthe cell, away from the action of hormones. Following internalisation, the receptors are eitherdestroyed or recycled.•Inactivation of receptors.• Decreased production of receptors.",
