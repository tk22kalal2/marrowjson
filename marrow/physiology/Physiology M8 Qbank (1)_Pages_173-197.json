      "question": "A 55-year-old woman had an autonomic neuropathy that disrupted the sympathetic nervesupply to the pupillary dilator muscle of her right eye. While having her eyes examined, theophthalmologist placed a sympathomimetic drug in both her eyes. The right eye becamemuch more dilated than the left eye. This suggests that:",
      "options": {
        "A": "The sympathetic nerve to the right eye had regenerated",
        "B": "The parasympathetic nerve supply to the right eye remained intact and compensated for theloss of the sympathetic nerve",
        "C": "Denervation supersensitivity had developed",
        "D": "The left eye also had nerve damage and so was not responding as expected"
      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "193Denervation supersensitivity develops in the muscle after the nerve supplying it is cut. Since thenerve to her right dilator pupillae is damaged, the right eye becomes excessively sensitive to thesympathomimetic drug. So, the right eye becomes much more dilated than the left.Denervation Supersensitivity:• When the motor nerve to skeletal muscle is degenerated, the muscle gradually becomes•extremely sensitive to acetylcholine. This is called denervation hypersensitivity or supersensitivity.Normally nicotinic receptors are located only in the vicinity of the motor endplate where theaxon of the motor nerve terminates. When the motor nerve is severed, there is a marked•proliferation of nicotinic receptors over a wide region of the neuromuscular junction.⚫ Denervation supersensitivity also occurs at autonomic junctions. Smooth muscle, unlike skeletalmuscle, does not atrophy when denervated, but it becomes hyperresponsive to the chemicalmediator that normally activates it.• This hyperresponsiveness can be demonstrated by using pharmacologic tools rather than actualnerve section. Prolonged use of a drug such as reserpine can be used to deplete transmitter storesand prevent the target organ from being exposed to norepinephrine for an extended period. Oncethe drug usage is stopped, smooth muscle and cardiac muscle will be supersensitive to subsequentrelease of the neurotransmitter.Option a) If the symapthetic nerve would have regenerated, both right and left eye would havebeen equally sensitive to the drug and so, would have dilated equally.Option b) Parasympathetic nerves supply the spinchter pupillae muscle. So, if stimulated theywould constrict the eye not dilate it. Also, the drug added was a sympathomimetic agent. So,parasympathetic nerves are not stimulated in the first placeOption d) If the left eye was damaged, it would also have denervation supersensitivity. Again, botheyes would dilate equally, but more than that of normal.",
