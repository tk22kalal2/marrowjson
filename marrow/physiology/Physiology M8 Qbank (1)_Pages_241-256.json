      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Initiation of visual impulse is associated with photoisomerization and hydrolysis of visual purple. Rhodopsin or visual purple, the photosensitive pigment, is composed of opsin (a protein belonging to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors) and retinal (an aldehyde of vitamin A). When light strikes the photoreceptors, retinal is chemically transformed in a process called photoisomerization, which begins the transduction process. Phototransduction in rods and cones: Rhodopsin (opsin + retinal) 11-cis Retinal → All-trans Retinal → Metarhodopsin II → Activation of transducin (G protein) → Activation of phosphodiesterase → ↓ cGMP → Closure of Na+ channels → Hyperpolarization → ↓ Synaptic neurotransmitter → Bipolar cell response and other neural responses.",

      "explanation": "11-cis-retinaldehyde combines with opsin to make rhodopsin. All-trans retinol is one form of Vitamin A, which is converted to 11-cis retinol under the influence of isomerase. Finally, 11-cis retinol is converted into 11-cis retinal, which combines with scotopsin to form rhodopsin. Rod discs: Rhodopsin molecules H3CCH3CH3-CH3H3CH (a) 11-cis-retinal. 11-cis-retinal and opsin are reassembled to form rhodopsin.

      "explanation": "Central fovea (foveola) contains only cones (a rod-free area) and is a region of the highest resolution. Regional variations in the retina: Macula lutea, located at the posterior pole, temporal to the optic disc, is an area of central vision with a high density of photoreceptors and interneurons. The optic disc lacks photoreceptors and is called the 'blind spot'. Normally, a person is unaware of the blind spot because the corresponding part of the visual field can be seen by the contralateral eye, and neurological processes complete the incomplete image perceptually. The peripheral retina has a higher ratio of rods to cones (20:1), a greater degree of convergence of photoreceptors to the target interneuron (bipolar cells), more sensitivity to light, and lower visual acuity.",

In most sensory receptors: Arrival of stimulus → Ion channels are opened up allowing current to flow => depolarization of the receptor. In photoreceptors: When the light strikes the outer segment, a cascade of reactions (refer figure) are initiated, that close some of the Na+ channels in the outer segment and result in hyperpolarization.
