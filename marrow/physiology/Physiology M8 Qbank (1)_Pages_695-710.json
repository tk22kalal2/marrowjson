      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "ACTH is more responsible than MSH for the hyperpigmentation seen in a patient with Cushingsyndrome due to pituitary cause (ACTH hypersecretion).ACTH is a derivative of POMC (Pro-opiomelanocortin). POMC is the precursor of ACTH,melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH), ẞ lipotropin and ẞ endorphin. Since themelanocyte-stimulating hormone is the byproduct of ACTH synthesis from POMC, any diseaseprocess which leads to ACTH overproduction will also lead to an increased level of MSH. ACTHhas mild MSH activity, hence elevated levels of ACTH acts on melanotropin-1 receptors causinggeneralized hyperpigmentation.A similar manifestation will also be seen in Addison's disease where the ACTH level is high.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The secretion of prolactin is increased after the sectioning of the pituitary stalk.Prolactin is unique among the pituitary hormones because the predominant central controlmechanism is inhibitory, i.e., dopamine inhibits prolactin secretion. Hence, sectioning of thepituitary stalk (Ex: In head trauma or compressive skull lesions) prevents this inhibition and leadsto increased secretion of prolactin.Note:If the pituitary stalk is cut above the pituitary gland but the entire hypothalamus is left intact, theposterior pituitary hormones (ADH &amp; Oxytocin) show a transient decrease because they areinitially synthesized in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus and arethen transported down to the nerve endings to the posterior pituitary gland, requiring severaldays to reach the gland.",

GH alsoincreases insulin-like growth factor (IGF) levels, which stimulate bone growth.Note: The pygmies of Africa have a congenital inability to synthesize significant amounts ofsomatomedin C (IGF-I). Therefore, even though their plasma concentration of growth hormone iseither normal or high, they have diminished amounts of IGF-I in the plasma, which accounts forthe short stature.

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Iodide trapping (iodide uptake) is not catalyzed by thyroid peroxidase. Oxidation, organification,and coupling are catalyzed by it.Steps in synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormone:• Iodide uptake: The basolateral sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) actively takes up I-(iodide) fromthe circulation into the follicular cells. It is then transported into the colloid through a pendrin(chloride-iodide) transporter706•⚫ Thyroglobulin synthesis: Thyroglobulin (Tg), is a large glycoprotein rich in tyrosine residues. It issynthesized by follicular cells.• Iodination of thyroglobulin: This is regulated by the thyroid peroxidase (TPO) enzyme. TPO hasthree functions:•Oxidation: TPO oxidizes I- to 12 (iodine) in the presence of H2O2•Organification: TPO links tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin with iodine (12) to formmonoiodotyrosine (MIT), diiodotyrosine (DIT)• Coupling reactions: TPO combines iodinated tyrosine residues to make MIT + DIT = T3(triiodothyronine), DIT + DIT = T4 (tetraiodothyronine)• Storage: Thyroid hormones are bound to thyroglobulin and stored in the follicular lumen ascolloids. The colloid has hormone reserves for 2-3 months•• Release: Iodinated thyroglobulin is taken up by the thyroid follicles via endocytosis and fuseswith lysosomes. It is cleaved by lysosomal proteolytic enzymes into MIT, DIT, T3, and T4.
