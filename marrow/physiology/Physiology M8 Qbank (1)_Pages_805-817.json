      "question": "A budding athlete who is keen to participate in long races visits his dietician for a discussion on his exercise capacity. When an athlete runs at a speed typical for the marathon race, the time until complete exhaustion is maximal with which of the following diets?",
      "options": {
        "A": "High-fat diet",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "When athletes run at speeds typical for the marathon race, the time that they can sustain the race until complete exhaustion (also known as endurance) is maximal with a high-carbohydrate diet. A person, who consumes a high-carbohydrate diet, stores far more glycogen in muscles than does a person who consumes either a mixed diet or a high-fat diet. Therefore, endurance is enhanced by a high-carbohydrate diet. When athletes run at speeds typical for the marathon race, their endurance is approximately the following: Diet - High-carbohydrate diet: 240 minutes, Mixed diet: 120 minutes, High-fat diet: 85 minutes.",

      "question": "A professional athlete uses phosphocreatine to improve his sprinting capacity and maximize muscle power during a 100 m dash race. Which of the following energy systems is utilized by the muscles of the athlete's body during a dash race?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Phosphagen system",
        "B": "Glycogen Lactic acid system",
        "C": "Aerobic system",
        "D": "Pentose phosphate pathway"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The phosphagen system is utilized by the muscles of the athlete's body during a dash race. The combined amounts of cell ATP and cell phosphocreatine are called the phosphagen energy system. These substances together can provide maximal muscle power for 8 to 10 seconds, almost enough for the 100-meter run. Thus, the energy from the phosphagen system is used for maximal short bursts of muscle power. Energy systems: The phosphocreatine-creatine system: The combined amounts of cell ATP and cell phosphocreatine are called the phosphagen energy system. These substances together can provide maximal muscle power for 8 to 10 seconds. The glycogen-lactic acid system: can provide 1.3 to 1.6 minutes of maximal muscle activity. The aerobic system: The aerobic system is the oxidation of foodstuffs in the mitochondria to provide energy. It can sustain muscle activity for an unlimited time (as long as nutrients last).",

        "C": "Have relatively more capillary content",
        "D": "Are twice as large in diameter compared to fast-twitch fibers"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Slow-twitch fibres, which are adapted for endurance running, are not larger in diameter than fast-twitch fibres. Fast-twitch fibres are about twice as large in diameter compared with slow-twitch fibres. Fast-Twitch and Slow-Twitch Muscle Fibers: Fast-twitch fibres can deliver extreme amounts of power from a few seconds to a minute. The enzymes that promote rapid release of energy from the phosphagen and glycogen-lactic acid energy systems are more active in fast-twitch fibres. Fast-twitch fibres are about twice as large in diameter compared with slow-twitch fibres. The gastrocnemius muscle has a higher preponderance of fast-twitch fibres, which gives it the capability of forceful and rapid contraction of the type used in jumping. Slow-twitch fibres are mainly organized for endurance, especially for the generation of aerobic energy. They have far more mitochondria than do the fast-twitch fibres. They contain considerably more myoglobin. The extra myoglobin increases the rate of diffusion of oxygen throughout the fibre. The enzymes of the aerobic metabolic system are considerably more active in slow-twitch fibres. The number of capillaries is greater in the vicinity of slow-twitch fibres. The soleus muscle has a higher preponderance of slow-twitch muscle fibres and therefore is used to a greater extent for prolonged lower leg muscle activity.",

      "question": "Regarding respiratory adjustment seen during exercise, which of the following statements is true?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Activity of joint proprioceptors is an important factor in increasing ventilation",
        "B": "Arterial pCO2 rises significantly",
        "C": "Arterio-venous difference in oxygen concentration remains constant",
        "D": "Arterial pH falls"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Signals from joint proprioceptors play a role in stimulating the respiratory drive during exercise. Regulation of respiration in exercise: During strenuous exercise, O2 consumption and CO2 formation can increase as much as 20-fold. Yet in the healthy athlete, the arterial PO2, PCO2, and pH remain almost exactly normal. This is because the alveolar ventilation increases along with the increased level of metabolism. Oxygen: Part of this stimulation of alveolar ventilation results from direct stimulation of the respiratory center by nervous signals. An additional part is believed to result from sensory signals transmitted into the respiratory center from the contracting muscles and joint proprioceptors. During strenuous exercise, the utilization of O2 in the entire body can increase to 75% to 85%. So, essentially all the oxygen is given to the exercising muscles, leading to an increased arterio-venous difference in oxygen concentration. Changes in pulmonary ventilation with exercise: Tension of muscle - Rest, Exercise, Length, Recovery.",

      "question": "Exercise at high altitudes is not hindered by which of the following factors?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Fall in blood bicarbonate levels",
        "B": "Fall in the total oxygen supply available",
        "C": "Respiratory alkalosis",
        "D": "High blood lactate levels"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not hinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes: The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes, and this reduction is in direct proportion to the decrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and this stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large quantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory alkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased ventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C) To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase bicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and brings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. Hence, the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE: Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts with oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid is then converted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and blood.",

      "question": "A 30-year-old man who is extremely motivated to participate in high-intensity exercises is advised to quit smoking by this physician. Which of the following is not a reason behind smoking-related decrease in exercise capacity?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Constriction of the terminal bronchioles",
        "B": "Increased fluid secretion into the bronchial tree",
        "C": "Paralysis of cilia on the surfaces of the respiratory epithelial cells",
        "D": "Desensitization of the chemoreceptors"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Smoking causes no change to the sensitivity of the chemoreceptors. The effect of smoking on pulmonary ventilation in exercise is as follows: Nicotine causes constriction of the terminal bronchioles of the lungs, which increases the resistance of air flow into and out of the lungs. The irritating effects of the smoke cause increased fluid secretion into the bronchial tree and some degree of swelling of the epithelial linings, which again increases airflow resistance. Nicotine paralyzes the cilia on the surfaces of the respiratory epithelial cells. As a result, much debris accumulates in the passageways, and this adds further to the difficulty in breathing. All these factors together make even a light smoker experience respiratory strain during maximal exercise, and their level of performance may be reduced. In persons with severe emphysema, as much as four-fifths of the respiratory membrane can be destroyed; then, even the slightest exercise can cause respiratory distress. Chronic smoking is an important cause of emphysema.",

      "question": "Which of the following is seen in response to exercise?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Increased cerebral blood flow due to an increase in systolic blood pressure",
        "B": "A fall in arterial pH",
        "C": "Increased blood flow in muscles after at least 15 minutes of activity",
        "D": "An increase in body temperature"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Exercise causes an increase in body temperature. Almost all the energy released by the body's metabolism of nutrients is eventually converted into body heat. Since metabolism rises significantly during exercise, there is an increase in the body temperature. This increase in body temperature is significant and even lethal conditions such as heatstroke can easily develop in an athlete. Other options: Option A: Cerebral blood flow is 'autoregulated' extremely well between arterial pressure limits of 60 and 140 mm Hg. That is, the mean arterial pressure can be increased to as high as 140 mm Hg without significant change in cerebral blood flow. Option B: The arterial Po2, Pco2, and pH remain almost exactly normal even though during strenuous exercise, O2 consumption and CO2 formation can increase as much as 20-fold. Option C: The increase in blood flow to exercising muscles is immediate and not after 15 minutes.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Coronary circulation increases during exercise. During exercise, blood flow decreases in inactive skeletal muscles, kidney, liver, and GIT; remains unaltered in the brain (due to autoregulation); increases in exercising muscles and coronary circulation; and initially decreases due to redistribution, but later increases due to an increase in temperature in the skin.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Left shift of Hb-O2 dissociation curve is not seen during exercise. During exercise, several factors shift the Hb-O2 dissociation curve considerably to the right, thus delivering extra amounts of O2 to the active, exercising muscle fibers. The right shift of Hb-O2 dissociation curve is due to the following: \n      • Release of large quantities of CO2 by the exercising muscles\n      • Increase in the hydrogen ion concentration in the muscle capillary blood\n      • Increase in the temperature of the muscle by 2° to 3°C",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The tremendous increase in muscle blood flow that occurs during skeletal muscle activity is caused mainly by chemicals acting directly on the muscle arterioles to cause dilation. These chemicals include: • Potassium ions, • Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), • Lactic acid, and • Carbon dioxide. Other factors leading to increased muscle flow include sympathetic nervous system activation, increase in arterial pressure, and increase in cardiac output. However, the effect of local metabolites is greater than these factors in increasing the muscle blood flow. Hence, the best answer is local metabolites.",

In isotonic exercise, there814is much vasodilatation in exercising muscles. So, even though the muscles are contracting, there isno rise in the diastolic blood pressure.Option (a) Since the muscle pump is more active during isotonic exercise, the venous return ishigher in isotonic exercise.Option (b) The increase in the muscle blood flow is less compared to isotonic exercise since inflowof blood is obstructed by sustained compression exerted by the contracting muscle.Option (d) Isometric exercise increases the after load of the heart leading to less increase in thestroke volume of the heart.",

In the given question, the CO2 production is 200mL/min, while the O2 consumption is 250mL/min. Therefore, Respiratory quotient = 200/250 = 0.8. The respiratory quotient (RQ) is used for determining the metabolic utilization of various foods. When carbohydrates are metabolized with one molecule of oxygen, one carbon dioxide molecule is released. Therefore, the RQ of carbohydrates = 1. When fats are oxidized, for every 100 molecules of oxygen consumed, 70 molecules of CO2 are released. Therefore, the RQ of fats is 0.70. Similarly, the respiratory quotient for proteins is 0.80.",
