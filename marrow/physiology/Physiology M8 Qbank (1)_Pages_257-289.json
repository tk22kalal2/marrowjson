      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "In the given figure, the fibre in yellow innervates the ends of the muscle spindle. Therefore, it is a gamma motor neuron. Many much smaller gamma motor neurons are located in the spinal cord anterior horns (shown as the yellow efferent fibre). These gamma motor neurons average 5 micrometers in diameter, which go to small, special skeletal muscle fibres called intrafusal fibres or the muscle spindle. These fibres constitute the ends of the muscle spindle, which help control basic muscle tone. Option (B): The alpha motor neurons (shown as the blue efferent fibre) are on an average 14 micrometers in diameter. These fibres branch many times after they enter the muscle and innervate the large skeletal muscle fibres at the motor endplate. Stimulation of a single alpha nerve fibre excites anywhere from three to several hundred skeletal muscle fibres, which are collectively called the motor unit. Option (C): A-beta fibres are fibres for touch and pressure. Option (D): A-delta fibres are fibres for pain and temperature.

A muscle spindle has: Intrafusal fibers - these are tiny skeletal muscles which have few or no actin and myosin filaments in the central portion. This portion acts as a sensory receptor. Extrafusal fibers. These fibers are positioned parallel to each other (Option A). There are two types of intrafusal fibers: Nuclear bag fibers - subdivided as dynamic and static nuclear bag fibers. Nuclear chain fibers. Sensory nerve supply: There are two types of sensory endings: Primary endings - (annulospiral ending) from Type Ia nerve fibers. This innervates both the nuclear bag and nuclear chain fibers. They are most sensitive to the velocity of the change in muscle length. This is called a dynamic response. (Option B) Secondary endings - from Type II nerve fibers. This innervates static nuclear bag and nuclear chain fibers. They do not innervate dynamic nuclear bag fibers.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Withdrawal reflexes are not accompanied by the same response on both sides of the body. On the ipsilateral side of the pain stimulus, flexors are stimulated (they contract) and extensors are inhibited (they relax), and the arm is jerked away from the stove. On the contralateral side, flexors are inhibited and extensors are stimulated (crossed extension reflex) to maintain balance. It results in flexion on the ipsilateral side and extension on the contralateral side. Somatosensory and pain afferent fibers elicit withdrawal of the stimulated body part from the noxious stimulus. Pain (e.g., touching a hot stove) stimulates the flexor reflex afferents of groups II, III, and IV. The afferent fibers synapse polysynaptically (via interneurons) onto motoneurons in the spinal cord. As a result of persistent neural activity in the polysynaptic circuits, an afterdischarge occurs. The afterdischarge prevents the muscle from relaxing for some time. Spinal cord, nociceptor, painful stimulus. Withdrawal reflex, sensory neuron, extensors inhibited, flexors contract, moving foot away from painful stimulus. Ascending pathways, gray matter, white matter, spinal cord, alpha motor neurons. Flexors inhibited, extensors contract as weight shifts to left leg. Painful stimulus activates nociceptor. Primary sensory neuron enters spinal cord and diverges. One collateral activates ascending pathways for sensation (pain) and postural adjustment (shift in center of gravity). Withdrawal reflex pulls foot away from painful stimulus. Crossed extensor reflex supports body as weight shifts away from painful stimulus.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The maintenance of normal posture depends on the integrity of the reflex arc. The muscles that maintain upright posture—that is, support the body's weight against gravity—are controlled by the brain and by reflex mechanisms. Three levels of the nervous system control movement: \n   • The spinal cord, which integrates spinal reflexes and contains central pattern generators.\n   • The brain stem and cerebellum, which control postural reflexes and hand and eye movements.\n   • The cerebral cortex and basal ganglia, which are responsible for voluntary movements. \n   The cerebrum, postural reflexes, hand, and eye movements, integrity of reflex arc, thalamus, cerebellum, brain stem, sensory areas of cerebral cortex, signal, spinal sensory receptors cord, muscle contraction and movement, feedback, sensory input from receptors goes to the spinal cord, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum. \n   Signals from the vestibular apparatus directly go to the cerebellum. \n   Output signals initiate movement without higher input. \n   Postural and spinal reflexes do not require integration in the cortex.",

      "explanation": "Golgi tendon organ is the receptor for inverse stretch reflex (refer figure). The Golgi tendon organs, unlike the spindles, are in series with the muscle fibers; therefore, they are stimulated by both passive stretch and active contraction of the muscle. The degree of stimulation by contraction of muscles is much greater than that caused by the stretching of muscles.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Golgi tendon reflex (Inverse myotatic/Inverse stretch reflex) is disynaptic, is the opposite, or inverse, of the stretch reflex. When tension on the muscle - and therefore on the tendon - becomes extreme, the inhibitory effect from the Golgi tendon organ can be so great that it leads to instantaneous relaxation of the entire muscle. This effect is called the lengthening reaction; it is probably a protective mechanism to prevent tearing of the muscle or avulsion of the tendon from its attachments to the bone.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The pathways for eliciting the flexor withdrawal reflex do not pass directly to the anterior motor neurons; instead, they first pass into the spinal cord interneuron pool of neurons and only secondarily to the motor neurons. The shortest possible circuit is a three- or four-neuron pathway. The following basic types of circuits are present: diverging circuits to spread the reflex to the necessary muscles for withdrawal; circuits to inhibit the antagonist muscles, called reciprocal inhibition circuits; and circuits to cause after-discharge are present. They prolong the reflex contraction of the muscles that last many fractions of a second after the stimulus is over. The flexor reflex is organized to withdraw a pained or otherwise irritated part of the body from a stimulus. Further, because of after-discharge, the reflex can hold the irritated part away from the stimulus for 0.1 to 3 seconds after the irritation is over. During this time, other reflexes and actions of the central nervous system can move the entire body away from the painful stimulus.",

      "explanation": "The cell bodies of alpha and gamma motor neurons to a given muscle lie close together. Both types are activated by interneurons in their immediate vicinity and sometimes directly by neurons of the descending pathways. During many voluntary and involuntary movements, they are coactivated, i.e., they are excited at almost the same time. (Alpha-gamma coactivation) The purpose of alpha-gamma coactivation: • First, it keeps the length of the receptor portion of the muscle spindle from changing during the course of the whole muscle contraction. Hence, the muscle contraction is not opposed by the stretch reflex. • Second, if the muscle spindle did not contract and relax along with the large muscle fibers, the receptor portion of the spindle would sometimes be flail and sometimes be overstretched. Coactivation thus ensures that information about muscle length will be continuously available to provide for adjustment during ongoing actions and to plan and program future movements.",

Fibers of the corticospinal tract originate from the primary motor cortex (about 30%), the premotor and supplementary motor areas (30%), and the somatosensory areas posterior to the central sulcus (40%). Most fibers (80% of fibers) decussate (cross) in the medullary pyramids and descend in the lateral white matter of the spinal cord to form the lateral corticospinal tract. They control the movements of the contralateral limbs. The remaining 20% make up the ventral corticospinal tract. These fibers remain uncrossed until reaching the spinal cord, where axons terminate bilaterally on spinal interneurons antecedent to motor neurons. These fibers control the movements of the axial musculature. Primary motor cortex = 30%, premotor area and supplementary motor area = 30%, somatic sensory parietal areas = 40%. The precentral gyrus (area 4), premotor, and supplementary motor (area 6) pass through the posterior limb of the internal capsule. The corticospinal tract forms the pyramids of the medulla. The majority cross at the lower part of the medulla to the opposite side. Fibers that do not cross pass ipsilaterally down the cord.

This in turn can lead to reflex contraction of the muscle. • Thus, muscles can be made to contract via stimulation of the alpha-motor neurons that innervate the extrafusal fibers or the gamma-motor neurons that initiate contraction indirectly via the stretch reflex.",

Decerebration: Complete transection of the brain stem between the superior and inferior colliculi permits the brain stem pathways to function independently of their input from higher brain structures. This is called a mid-collicular decerebration. This lesion interrupts all input from the cortex (corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts) and red nucleus (rubrospinal tract), primarily to distal muscles of the extremities. The excitatory and inhibitory reticulospinal pathways (primarily to postural extensor muscles) remain intact. The dominance of drive from ascending sensory pathways to the excitatory reticulospinal pathway leads to hyperactivity in extensor muscles in all four extremities, which are called decerebrate rigidity. The excitatory input from the reticulospinal pathway activates gamma-motor neurons, which indirectly activate alpha-motor neurons (via Ia spindle afferent activity). This is called the gamma loop. Option 4: Spinal shock is different from decerebrate rigidity as it is a transient state that can occur immediately after a spinal cord injury. It is characterized by a temporary loss or depression of spinal reflexes below the level of the injury.",

The usual stimulus that causes this excess activity is a strong pain stimulus to the skin or excessive filling of a viscus, such as over-distention of the bladder or the gut. The mass reflex involves large portions or even all of the cord. The effects are as follows: a major portion of the body's skeletal muscles goes into strong flexor spasms; the colon and bladder are likely to evacuate; the arterial pressure often rises to maximal values, sometimes to a systolic pressure well over 200 mm Hg; and large areas of the body break out into profuse sweating.

It is built around 3 to 12 tiny intrafusal muscle fibers that are attached to the glycocalyx of the surrounding large extrafusal skeletal muscle fibers. Each intrafusal muscle fiber is a tiny skeletal muscle fiber. However, the central region of each of these fibers has few or no actin and myosin filaments. Therefore, this central portion does not contract when the ends do. Instead, it functions as a sensory receptor. The end portions that do contract are excited by small gamma motor nerve fibers. Solution to Question 2: Motor supply to muscle spindle is by Muscle spindles have a motor nerve supply of their own. These nerves belong to Erlanger and Gasser's A group. They are just 3–6 µ in diameter (hence called small motor nerve system/efferents of Leksell) and go exclusively to muscle spindles. Note: Motor innervation of muscle spindle is by gamma efferents. Motor innervation of extrafusal fibers is by alpha motor neurons. Nuclear bag muscle fibers: 1-3 per muscle spindle. Nuclear chain muscle fibers: 3-9 per muscle spindle. Muscle fibers Muscle Extrafusal fibers Intrafusal fibers/Muscle spindle Contractile fibers Afferent: None Nuclear chain fibers Afferent: Ia + II Efferent: alpha motor neurons Efferent: Gamma static Nuclear bag fibers Afferent: Ia Efferent: Gamma dynamic Structure of a muscle spindle Sensory neuron (Ia, II) - Flower spray sensory neuron - Golgi tendon organ Solution to Question 3: In the given figure, the fiber in yellow innervates the ends of the muscle spindle. Therefore, it is a gamma motor neuron. Many much smaller gamma motor neurons are located in the spinal cord anterior horns (shown as the yellow efferent fiber). These gamma motor neurons average 5 micrometers in diameter, which go to small, special skeletal muscle fibers called intrafusal fibers or the muscle spindle. These fibers constitute the ends of the muscle spindle, which help control basic muscle tone. Option (b): The alpha motor neurons (shown as the blue efferent fibre) are on an average 14 micrometers in diameter. These fibers branch many times after they enter the muscle and innervate the large skeletal muscle fibers at the motor endplate. Stimulation of a single alpha nerve fiber excites anywhere from three to several hundred skeletal muscle fibers, which are collectively called the motor unit. Option (c): A-beta fibers are fibers for touch and pressure. Option (d): A-delta fibers are fibers for pain and temperature.
