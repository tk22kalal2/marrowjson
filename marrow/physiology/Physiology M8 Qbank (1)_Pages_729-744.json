Most of it is bound to transcortin, acorticosteroid-specific ° 2 globulin, and the rest to albumin. This high degree of binding to plasmaproteins slows the elimination of cortisol. Therefore, cortisol has a longer half-life of 60 to 90minutes.Since only about 60% of aldosterone is in bound form, it has a relatively short half-life of about 20minutes.",
