        "D": "Systemic hypertension."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given scenario describes orthopnea in congestive heart failure. It is due to the reservoir function of pulmonary veins. Orthopnea is dyspnea occurring in the recumbent position. It results from redistribution of fluid from the splanchnic circulation and lower extremities (increased venous return) into the heart during recumbency. This increased venous return is not put out by the left ventricle and hence pools in the pulmonary veins that act as capacitance vessels (reservoir function), adding to the already congested pulmonary vasculature, resulting in breathing difficulty.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The interstitial fluid pressure is negative in the lungs. The interstitial fluid pressure is slightly negative in the body except in the encapsulated organs. It is positive in rigid closed compartments - bone marrow, brain, and encapsulated organs - kidney, skeletal muscle. This is due to the fact that in the kidneys, high-pressure vessels push the interstitial fluid against an unyielding fibrous capsule, raising the pressure. The same principle applies to skeletal muscle surrounded by layers of fascia.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Blood flow per minute in the pulmonary circulation is equal to flow through the systemic circulation, so as to provide a continuous blood supply to the body. If the flow rate is slower in the pulmonary circulation than systemic, then the left ventricle would soon empty completely. If the flow rate is faster in the pulmonary circulation, then the left ventricle would soon be overloaded. Please note that because some blood flows into the bronchial arteries, the actual flow through the pulmonary circulation is slightly less than the flow through the systemic circulation. However, this question aims to state that the blood flow through both pulmonary and systemic circulation is largely equal.",

        "D": "Hypovolemic shock"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The shock due to a transfusion reaction is distributive shock. During transfusion reaction, there is decreased systemic vascular resistance due to system-wide vasodilation mediated by the release of histamine by mast cells in response to antigen-bound IgE, leading to distributive shock. Types of circulatory shock: Hypovolemic shock: due to decreased blood in the vascular compartment. E.g., hemorrhage, dehydration. Cardiogenic shock: due to decreased capacity of the heart to pump. E.g., any pathology of the heart decreasing its ability to maintain cardiac output. Obstructive shock: due to conditions causing obstruction to blood flow in the lungs and heart. E.g.: pulmonary embolism. Distributive/vasculogenic shock: excessive vasodilation leading to impaired organ perfusion. E.g.: septic shock, SIRS, transfusion reaction, Addisonian crisis, neurogenic shock. Three stages of shock: Non-progressive: also called compensated shock, where normal compensatory mechanisms eventually cause full recovery without help from outside therapy. Progressive: also called non-compensated, without therapy it gets steadily worse. Irreversible: even therapy is inadequate to save life.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "During fetal life, blood vessel with maximum concentration of oxygen is the umbilical vein. The placenta, umbilical vein, umbilical cord (contains umbilical artery and umbilical vein), mixed blood travels to the head and body, and back to the placenta via the aorta. The ductus arteriosus connects the aorta with the pulmonary artery, further shunting blood away from the lungs and into the aorta. The foramen ovale allows oxygenated blood in the right atrium to reach the left atrium. Oxygenated blood from the placenta enters the right atrium via the inferior vena cava. The ductus venosus shunts oxygenated blood from the placenta away from the semi-functional liver and toward the heart. Blood arrives via the umbilical vein.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Progressive hemorrhagic shock is characterized by the presence of blood clots in the small blood vessels. The initiating cause of this blockage is sluggish blood flow in the microvessels. Tissue metabolites plus other deterioration products from the ischemic tissues cause minute clots in these vessels. Thus, the microvasculature gets blocked by the sludged blood. In progressive hemorrhagic shock, there is increased lysosomal activity, decreased active transport of sodium, and tissue acidosis.",

      "correct_answer": "C",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Thin-walled and delicate vessels like capillaries are less prone to rupture, and this can be explained by Laplace's law. The principal reason for these vessels' relative invulnerability is their small diameter. The protective effect of small size, in this case, is an example of the law of Laplace. Laplace's law states that tension in the wall of a cylinder (T) is equal to the product of the transmural pressure (P) and the radius (r) divided by the wall thickness (w): T = Pr/w. As the tissue pressure is low, P is equated to the pressure inside the blood vessel. W can be ignored as well, since capillaries are thin-walled. Hence: P = T/r. In a thin-walled viscus, P = T divided by the two principal radii of curvature of the viscus: P = T(1/r1+1/r2). In a cylinder such as a blood vessel, one radius is infinite, so P = T/r. Hence, the smaller the radius, the lower is the tension necessary in the wall to balance the distending pressure.",

Q - Volume flux, ΔP - Change in pressure, r - Pipe or vessel radius, n - Viscosity, l - Pipe or vessel length. Blood flow (F) inside the vessel depends on: • Pressure difference: directly proportional, • Viscosity: inversely proportional, • Radius: directly proportional to the fourth power, • Length of the vessel: inversely proportional. Here, the radius is doubled, so the flow increases by 2 to the power of 4 = 16. The length of the vessel is also doubled, so the flow decreases by half (÷2) = 8.",

Cuthbertson's ebb and flow response to trauma: The \"ebb\" phase lasts for a brief duration and is associated with a decline in body temperature and oxygen consumption, aimed at reducing post-traumatic energy depletion. The \"flow\" phase occurs after resuscitation from a state of shock, which leads to an increased metabolic turnover, activation of the innate immune system and induction of the hepatic acute-phase response.

      "explanation": "Mayer waves are due to the variation of arterial pressure due to reflex changes in nervous control of blood pressure. The most important mechanisms are as follows: I: Baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflex: High pressure excites the baroreceptors --> inhibits sympathetic nervous system and lowers the pressure --> The decreased pressure, in turn, reduces the baroreceptor stimulation --> elevating the pressure to a high value (the response is not instantaneous, it is delayed until a few seconds later). This high pressure then initiates another cycle, and the oscillation continues. II: Oscillation of the CNS Ischemic Response: The cerebrospinal fluid pressure is raised to 160 mm Hg --> causes compression of cerebral blood vessels --> cerebral ischemia --> CNS ischemic pressure response raises the arterial pressure up to 200 mm Hg --> the brain ischemia is relieved and the sympathetic nervous system becomes inactive --> the arterial pressure falls rapidly back to a much lower value, causing brain ischemia once again --> initiates another rise in pressure. This chain of events repeats itself cyclically as long as the cerebrospinal fluid pressure remains elevated.",

Starling stated that 'the energy of contraction is proportional to the initial length of the cardiac muscle fibre'. When cardiac output is regulated by changes in cardiac fibre length, this is referred to as heterometric regulation.
