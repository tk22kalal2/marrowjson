      "explanation": "•Sperm motility is increased by vaginal secretions.On coming in contact with the fluids of the female genital tract, multiple changes occur thatactivate the sperm for the final processes of fertilization. These collective changes are calledcapacitation of the spermatozoa, which normally requires from 1 to 10 hours.The following changes are believed to occur:The uterine and fallopian tube fluids wash away the various inhibitory factors that suppresssperm activity in the male genital ducts.• While the spermatozoa remain in the fluid of the male genital ducts, they are continuallyexposed to many floating vesicles from the seminiferous tubules containing large amounts ofcholesterol. This cholesterol is continually added to the cellular membrane covering the spermacrosome, toughening this membrane and preventing the release of its enzymes.• After ejaculation, the sperm deposited in the vagina swim away from the cholesterol vesiclesupward into the uterine cavity, and they gradually lose much of their other excess cholesterolduring the next few hours. In doing so, the membrane at the head of the sperm (the acrosome)becomes much weaker.• The membrane of the sperm also becomes much more permeable to calcium ions, so calciumnow enters the sperm in abundance and changes the activity of the flagellum, giving it a powerfulwhiplash motion in contrast to its previously weak undulating motion. In addition, the calciumions cause changes in the cellular membrane that cover the leading edge of the acrosome, makingit possible for the acrosome to release its enzymes rapidly and easily as the sperm penetrates thegranulosa cell mass surrounding the ovum, and even more so as it attempts to penetrate the zonapellucida of the ovum.779",

      "explanation": "Insulin has no role in the attainment of puberty. GH, leptin and testosterone are all required forthe onset of puberty.The onset of puberty is marked by enhanced androgenic activity. The growth spurt of adolescentmales is influenced by a complex interplay between androgens, growth hormone (GH), nutrition,and genetic factors.781Leptin, the satiety-producing hormone secreted by fat cells, may be the link between body weightand puberty.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The hormone that plays a permissive role in the attainment of puberty is leptin.It now appears that leptin may be the link between body weight and puberty. Leptin is asatiety-producing hormone secreted by adipocytes. High leptin levels reduce appetite and increaseenergy expenditure.Evidence for which is given by:• Obese ob/ob mice that cannot make leptin are infertile, and their fertility is restored byinjections of leptin.• Leptin treatment also induces precocious puberty in immature female mice.• However, the way that leptin fits into the overall control of puberty remains to be determined.Leptin also accelerates GnRH pulsatility in neurons, fastening puberty.782",
