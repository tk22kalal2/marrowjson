      "explanation": "Retained judgement will be least likely seen if the patient survives such a devastating injury.Injury to the frontal lobe may lead to frontal lobe syndrome, which consists of poor judgment,slowed thinking, decreased curiosity, social withdrawal, and irritability.Frontal lobe injury:• Impairs the executive functions: motivation, attention, and sequencing of actions•Aphasia, apraxia, constructional apraxia, neglect, and memory deficits can be seen•Characterized by changes in personality•Apathetic indifference and impulsive behaviour.•Commonly urinary incontinence and faecal incontinence is seen• Commonly produced by trauma, infarcts, tumours, lobotomy, multiple sclerosis, or Pick'sdisease.Frontal lobe pathology may become apparent only under unstructured, stressful, real-lifesituations and are difficult to detect in intelligence scales, as IQ mostly requires parietal lobeactivation.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Broca's motor speech area is likely to be affected in the vascular injury of the inferior frontal gyrus. A lesion in this region leads to motor/Broca's aphasia. Speech is non-fluent and interrupted by many word-finding pauses. The speech is impoverished in function words that contribute to the syntax but is enriched in meaningful nouns and verbs. However, comprehension of speech is intact and the patient knows what he wants to say. For example, a patient with Broca's aphasia may say 'walk dog' instead of 'I want to take the dog for a walk'.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "349Prosopagnosia is difficulty in identifying known faces.In humans, storage and recognition of faces is more strongly represented in the right inferiortemporal lobe in right-handed individuals, though the left lobe is also active. Damage to this areacan cause prosopagnosia.Patients with this abnormality can recognize forms and reproduce them. They can recognizepeople by their voices, and many of them show autonomic responses when they see familiar asopposed to unfamiliar faces. However, they cannot identify the familiar faces they see. The lefthemisphere is also involved, but the role of the right hemisphere is primary.The presence of autonomic response to a familiar face in the absence of recognition has beenexplained by postulating the existence of a separate dorsal pathway for processing informationabout faces that leads to recognition at only a subconscious level.Note:• Autotopagnosia - inability to recognize or to orient any part of one's own body• Simultagnosia - inability to recognize multiple elements in a visual presentation, one object orsome elements of a scene can be appreciated but not the display as a wholeSomatagnosia - inability to identify any part of the body, either one's own or another's body• Tactile agnosia (astereognosis) - inability to recognize objects by touch, in the presence of intactcutaneous and proprioceptive hand sensation; caused by a lesion in the contralateral parietal lobe",

Thus an emotionally intense experience is etched in memory, which is thebasis for learned fear responses.• Damage to the amygdala ablates the ability to distinguish fear and anger in other persons' voicesand facial expressions.• Regulation of emotion - frontal lobe.350The Limbic SystemFornixPineal glandCorpus callosumCOMPONENTS INTHE DIENCEPHALONAnterior group ofthalamic nucleiHypothalamus-Mamillary body-Amygdaloid bodyCOMPONENTS INTHE CEREBRUM- Cingulate gyrus-Parahippocampalgyrus- Hippocampus351",
