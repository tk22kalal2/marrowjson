      "explanation": "At the end of inspiration, the alveolar pressure is zero with reference to the atmospheric pressure.Whenever alveolar pressure equals atmospheric pressure, alveolar pressure is said to be zero. Thishappens when no air is moving in or out of the lungs.During inspiration, the diaphragm contracts, causing the volume of the thorax to increase. As lungvolume increases, the pressure in the lungs must decrease. (Boyle's law states that P × V isconstant at a given temperature.) Halfway through inspiration, the alveolar pressure falls belowatmospheric pressure (-1 cm H2O). The pressure gradient between the atmosphere and the alveolidrives airflow into the lung. Air flows into the lungs until, at the end of inspiration, alveolarpressure is once again equal to the atmospheric pressure; the pressure gradient between theatmosphere and the alveoli has dissipated, and airflow into the lungs ceases.During expiration, alveolar pressure rises to about +1 cm of H2O.",

      "explanation": "The transpulmonary pressure would be 12 cmH2O when she inhales 600mL of air.Transpulmonary pressure (Ptp) is the difference between alveolar pressure (Palv) and intrapleuralpressure (Pip). It is given by the formula: Ptp = Palv-Pip. Inspiration causes a negative change inboth the Palv and Pip. Lung compliance is the extent to which the lungs will expand for each unitincrease in transpulmonary pressure.In a normal adult, the pulmonary compliance is 0.2 L/cmH2O or 200 mL/cmH2O of both lungstogether. Hence, expanding the lungs by 200 mL of inspired air will require an increase in Ptp by1 cm H2O.Given:Pulmonary compliance = 0.2 L/cm H2O= 0.2 L/cm H2O = 200 ml/cm H20Alveolar pressure at the beginning of inspiration = 4 cmH2OIntrapleural pressure at the beginning of inspiration = -5 cmH2OVolume of air inhaled = 600mL (0.6L)Step 1: Calculate the initial transpulmonary pressure (Ptp).Transpulmonary pressure = Alveolar pressure - Intrapleural pressure; Initial transpulmonarypressure = 4 cmH2O - (-5 cmH2O) = 9 cmH2OStep 2: Use the lung compliance formula to find the change in transpulmonary pressure.Lung compliance = Change in volume / Change in transpulmonary pressure.Pulmonary compliance is 0.2 L/cmH2O or 200 mL/cmH2O. Hence, to expand the lungs by 200mL of inspired air, it will require an increase in Ptp by 1 cm H2O. So, for 600 ml inspired air, thecompliance is = 600 mL / 200 mL/cm H2O = 3 cmH2OStep 3: Calculate the transpulmonary pressure (Ptp) after inhaling 600mL of air.During inspiration, the alveolar pressure (Palv) decreases, and the intrapleural pressure (Pip)becomes more negative.Final transpulmonary pressure=Initial transpulmonary pressure + change in transpulmonarypressure; Final transpulmonary pressure = 9 cmH2O + 3 cmH2O = 12 cmH2O.375",

(-6 mmHg).During forced expiration, contraction of the expiratory muscles raises intrapleural pressure to apositive value.Intrapleural pressure is the pressure of the fluid in the thin space between the visceral andparietal pleura.372Solution to Question 3:The intrapleural pressure is negative both during inspiration and expiration because the thoraciccage and lung recoil in opposite direction.The 2 factors that lead to a negative or subatmospheric intrapleural pressure are:• The lungs, with their elastic properties, tend to collapse, and the chest wall, with its elasticproperties, tends to spring out. When these two opposing forces pull on the intrapleural space, anegative pressure, or vacuum, is created..⚫ The continuous suction of excess fluid into the lymphatic channels.Transpulmonary pressure:760 mm Hg -756 mm Hg= 4 mm HgIntrapleural pressure:756 mm Hg (-4 mm Hg)0Atmospheric pressureIntra-alveolar pressure:760 mm Hg (0 mm Hg)DiaphragmParietal pleura- Visceral pleuraPleural cavity-Thoracic wall-LungApplied aspect:In cases of pneumothorax, intrapleural pressure suddenly becomes equal to atmospheric pressure.Thus instead of its normal negative value, intrapleural pressure becomes zero. Hence lungscollapse and the chest wall spring out.Solution to Question 4:The normal intrapleural pressure at the beginning of inspiration is about -3.4 cm H2O (-2.5mmHg).Intrapleural pressure is the pressure of the fluid in the thin space between the lung pleura and thechest wall pleura. During normal inspiration, expansion of the chest cage pulls outward on thelungs with greater force and creates more negative pressure.At the peak of normal inspiration, it is about -8.15 cm H2O (-5.4 mm Hg).Note: 1mm Hg = 1.36 cm H2O373Solution to Question 5:At the end of inspiration, the alveolar pressure is zero with reference to the atmospheric pressure.Whenever alveolar pressure equals atmospheric pressure, alveolar pressure is said to be zero. Thishappens when no air is moving in or out of the lungs.During inspiration, the diaphragm contracts, causing the volume of the thorax to increase. As lungvolume increases, the pressure in the lungs must decrease. (Boyle's law states that P × V isconstant at a given temperature.) Halfway through inspiration, the alveolar pressure falls belowatmospheric pressure (-1 cm H2O). The pressure gradient between the atmosphere and the alveolidrives airflow into the lung. Air flows into the lungs until, at the end of inspiration, alveolarpressure is once again equal to the atmospheric pressure; the pressure gradient between theatmosphere and the alveoli has dissipated, and airflow into the lungs ceases.During expiration, alveolar pressure rises to about +1 cm of H2O.Solution to Question 6:Transpulmonary pressure is intra-alveolar pressure minus intrapleural pressure. (MnemonicTAP: Transpulmonary pressure = Alveolar pressure - Pleural pressure)It is the pressure difference between that in the alveoli and that on the outer surfaces of the lungs,and it is a measure of the elastic forces in the lungs that tend to collapse the lungs at each instantof respiration, called the recoil pressure.Transpulmonary pressure:760 mm Hg -756 mm Hg= 4 mm HgIntrapleural pressure:756 mm Hg (-4 mm Hg)Solution to Question 7:0TAtmospheric pressureIntra-alveolar pressure:760 mm Hg (0 mm Hg)DiaphragmParietal pleuraVisceral pleuraPleural cavity-Thoracic wall-Lung374Compliance is change in volume per unit change in pressure.• C= AV/APIn this case,AV= 1000 mLAP-12-(-4)=-8 cm of H2OThe minus sign indicates that the pressure has fallen by 8cms of H20 at the end of inspirationTherefore the compliance is,C= 1000/8= 125 mL/cm of H2OSolution to Question 8:The transpulmonary pressure would be 12 cmH2O when she inhales 600mL of air.Transpulmonary pressure (Ptp) is the difference between alveolar pressure (Palv) and intrapleuralpressure (Pip). It is given by the formula: Ptp = Palv-Pip. Inspiration causes a negative change inboth the Palv and Pip. Lung compliance is the extent to which the lungs will expand for each unitincrease in transpulmonary pressure.In a normal adult, the pulmonary compliance is 0.2 L/cmH2O or 200 mL/cmH2O of both lungstogether. Hence, expanding the lungs by 200 mL of inspired air will require an increase in Ptp by1 cm H2O.Given:Pulmonary compliance = 0.2 L/cm H2O= 0.2 L/cm H2O = 200 ml/cm H20Alveolar pressure at the beginning of inspiration = 4 cmH2OIntrapleural pressure at the beginning of inspiration = -5 cmH2OVolume of air inhaled = 600mL (0.6L)Step 1: Calculate the initial transpulmonary pressure (Ptp).Transpulmonary pressure = Alveolar pressure - Intrapleural pressure; Initial transpulmonarypressure = 4 cmH2O - (-5 cmH2O) = 9 cmH2OStep 2: Use the lung compliance formula to find the change in transpulmonary pressure.Lung compliance = Change in volume / Change in transpulmonary pressure.Pulmonary compliance is 0.2 L/cmH2O or 200 mL/cmH2O. Hence, to expand the lungs by 200mL of inspired air, it will require an increase in Ptp by 1 cm H2O. So, for 600 ml inspired air, thecompliance is = 600 mL / 200 mL/cm H2O = 3 cmH2OStep 3: Calculate the transpulmonary pressure (Ptp) after inhaling 600mL of air.During inspiration, the alveolar pressure (Palv) decreases, and the intrapleural pressure (Pip)becomes more negative.Final transpulmonary pressure=Initial transpulmonary pressure + change in transpulmonarypressure; Final transpulmonary pressure = 9 cmH2O + 3 cmH2O = 12 cmH2O.375Solution to Question 9:A liquid-ventilated lung is more compliant compared to a gas-ventilated lung.Compliance is a measure of distensibility. In a gas-filled lung, surface tension and elastic recoilforces act to collapse the lung and thus reduce compliance.Volume(% maximum inflation)10050Lung complianceDeflation10SalineAirHysterisis20Pressure (cm H2O)MARROWInflationN3040• When the lungs are filled with air, there is an interface between the alveolar fluid and the air inthe alveoli; so, there is surface tension.•• But, in the case of the saline solution-filled lungs, there is no air-fluid interface and there isno surface tension, making it more compliant.• Hence, the pressure-volume curve obtained with saline measures only the tissue elasticity.•The difference in the curves generated during inflation and deflation, termed hysteresis, is notpresent in the saline-generated curves.Solution to Question 10:Surfactant is the factor responsible for hysteresis.Difference between the curve of inflation (inspiration) and deflation (expiration) in apressure-volume curve of the lung is termed as hysteresis.The alveolar environment and, specifically, the secreted factors that help reduce surface tensionand keep alveoli from collapsing, contribute to hysteresis.376Inspiration curve:Expiration curve:Volume(% maximum inflation)10050Lung complianceDeflationSalineAirHysterisis1020Pressure (cm H2O)MARROWBeginning of inspiration:Lung volume is less-intermolecular forceis morelessInflationN3040Surfactant density isSurface tension is highCompliance is lessFlat curveAs inspiration continues:Surfactant density increasesSurface tension reducesComplaince is moreSlope increases377Beginning of expiration:Lung volume is more-intermolecularforce is lessRate of decrease in lung volume is morethan rate of clearance of surfactantSurfactant density remains more andsurface tension decreasesCompliance is moreAs expiration continues:Surfactant is removed from the liquidlining and the density of surfactantremains relatively constant, as doesthe compliance of the lung.Solution to Question 11:• The pressure-volume relationship is the fundamental relation between the work of breathing andlung mechanics.• The diagram depicts the change in volume with respect to the change in intrapleural pressure,which is compliance. Here, the change is more (steep curve) with B and least (flat curve) with C.⚫The \"stiffer\" lung displays a more horizontal curve (C), meaning that it takes a greater pressure toachieve the same inflation volume compared with a normal lung (",

        "C": ", where the expanding force onthe chest wall is exactly equal to the collapsing force on the lungs. FRC is also known as relaxationvolume and represents the amount of air remaining in the lungs at the end of normal expiration.379At the point where volume= FRC,• Intraalveolar pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure and considered as zero.•Intrapleural pressure is negative (-2.5 mmHg)-• Transpulmonary pressure = Intraalveolar pressure - intrapleural pressure = 0 (-2.5 mmHg) -+2.5 mmHg.For compliance of lung - Pressure considered is Transpulmonary pressure. So at FRC,Transpulmonary pressure is positive (+2.5 mmHg). Hence, B indicates compliance of lung.-For compliance of chest wall – Pressure considered is intrapleural – atmospheric pressure. AtFRC, this value is -2.5 mmHg. Hence, A represents compliance of the chest wall.When the volume is FRC, the combined lung and chest-wall curve intersects the X-axis at anairway pressure of zero. Hence, C represents the combined chest wall and lung compliance.==Solution to Question 13:Specific compliance is obtained by dividing compliance by functional residual capacity.Types of compliance:• Static compliance: It is measured at rest.• Dynamic compliance: It is measured during breathing. It considers airflowresistance or impedance into account. It is maximum in medium-sized bronchi..Specific compliance:• Lung compliance is volume-dependent.•• It is greater at low lung volumes than at high lung volumes. For this reason, the term specificcompliance is often used to denote compliance with reference to the original lung volume.• The total compliance of a normal person near the normal end-expiratory lung volume (functionalresidual capacity [FRC]) is about 0.1 L/cm H20.•The compliance of the lungs is about 0.2 L/cm H2O.Applied aspect:In case of emphysema, compliance is increased but specific compliance decreases (because FRC isseverely elevate",
