      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Reflex responsible for tachycardia during right atrial distension is Bainbridge reflex.516Atrial Reflex Control of Heart Rate: The Bainbridge Reflex• The stretch receptors of the atria that elicit the Bainbridge reflex transmit their afferent signalsthrough the vagus nerves to the medulla of the brain.⚫ Then efferent signals are transmitted back through vagal and sympathetic nerves to increaseheart rate and strength of heart contraction.Bezold-Jarisch Reflex:• Activation of chemosensitive vagal C fibres in the cardiopulmonary region (e.g. Juxta capillaryregion of alveoli, ventricles, atria, great veins, and pulmonary artery) causes profound brady-cardia, hypotension and a brief period of apnea followed by rapid shallow breathing.Cushing Reflex:• When ICP is increased, the blood supply to RVLM neurons is compromised.• The local hypoxia and hypercapnia causes an increase in discharge from the neurons, producinghypertension, bradycardia and irregular respiration.• The resultant rise in systemic arterial pressure tends to restore the blood flow to the medulla.",

      "explanation": "The correct sequence of events that occur after the p-wave is 1-2-4-3, ie:-a wave in JVP → First heart sound →T wave in ECG → Rapid filling of ventricles.The sequence of the events in this question can be better understood with the following diagram:Events of the cardiac cycle120Aortic valveopens100806040Mitral valvecloses20Volume ((mL) PresPressure (mmHg)1309050Isovolumic contractionEjectionIsovolumic relaxationRapid inflowAortic valveclosesMitral valveopensDiastasisAtrial systole1st2nd3rdSystoleDiastole©MARROWDR00S------0Aortic pressureAtrial pressureVentricular pressureVentricular VolumeElectrocardiogramPhonocardiogramSystole•The p wave in the ECG represents atrial depolarization, which causes contraction of the atria,represented by the 'a' wave in the JVP. Atrial contraction causes final filling of the ventricles(fourth phase of ventricular diastole)517• Atrial contraction is followed by the closure of the mitral valve, which causes the first-heartsound.⚫ This is followed by the isovolumetric contraction of the ventricle, which causes c wave in JVP,•due to bulging of the tricuspid valve. This is followed by the rapid ejection phase of the ventricle.•The T wave of ECG occurs during ventricular repolarization, which is followed by the opening ofthe mitral valve, followed by rapid filling phase of the ventricle (second phase of ventriculardiastole).Note: Passive rapid filling occurs as the mitral valve opens just before atrial contraction occurs.",
