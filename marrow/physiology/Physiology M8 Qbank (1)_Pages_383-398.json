But, a decrease inperfusion is higher than the decrease in ventilation. Hence, ratio increases (3.2).At the base of lung:Both ventilation and perfusion increase since the flow is towards gravity. Increase in perfusion ismore than increase in ventilation, i.e., denominator increases. Hence, ratio decreases to 0.6.The average value of V/Q ratio throughout lungs is 0.8.•Important points:•If the effect of gravity is eliminated, as in the supine position, the value is the same in all parts ofthe lung = 0.8.• V/Q ratio is infinity when perfusion is zero as in case of pulmonary embolism.•V/Q ratio is zero when ventilation is zero like in case of foreign body obstruction.• High V/Q ratio at apex leads to high pAO2 which favors the growth of microorganisms liketubercle bacilli.Intra-pleural pressure decreases as we move from the base to the apex of the lung i.e- becomesmore negative as we move from the base to the apex of the lung.",

This dissipates the capillary pressure and returns to the startof the cycle.The blood flow in this region is determined by the pulmonary artery-alveolar pressure difference.Blood \"falls\" into the pulmonary veins, which are compliant and take whatever amount of bloodcan flow into them.

      "explanation": "During moderate exercise, there is no change in arterial pO2, arterial pCO2 or arterial pH.Ventilation increases abruptly at the onset of exercise due to psychic stimuli and afferent impulsesfrom proprioceptors in muscles, tendons, and joints. This is followed by a brief pause and then agradual increase in ventilation. This gradual increase in ventilation is believed to be due tomultiple factors such as an increase in body temperature, increase in plasma K+ level stimulatingperipheral chemoreceptors, or the sensitivity of the neurons controlling the response to CO2.In strenuous exercise, at a certain point, the O2 uptake reaches its maximum levels, beyond whichit cannot increase further. This leads to a rise in blood lactate levels. Buffering of lactic acidliberates CO2 which further increases ventilation. The increased production of lactic acid, increasein ventilation and CO2 production are proportional, and alveolar and arterial CO2 changes little tonil. This is called isocapnic buffering.398",
