Using that, to we calculatethe true RPF, we divide it by the extraction ratio to account for the 10% that is not filtered bydividing the ERPF by 0.9, hence getting the final value of ~ 700mL per minuteWhen peripheral venous plasma concentration of PAH is used for calculation of RPF, RPFobtained is called effective renal plasma flow (ERPF).

This contraction prevents excessive stretch of thevessel. This prevents excessive increase of renal blood flow and GFR by raising vascularresistance.This mechanism may be more important in protecting the kidney from hypertension-inducedinjury.Autoregulation has two main mechanisms:• Metabolic mechanism: Tissues produce vasodilatory metabolites that regulate flow e.g.prostaglandins, NO, CO2, H+ and K+• Myogenic mechanismMyogenic autoregulation of renal blood flow↑arterial wall tension (BP)Stretching of blood vessels (afferent arteriole smooth muscle)Opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels↑Calcium influxIncreased intracellular calciumVasoconstrictionPrevent excessive increase of renal blood flow and GFROMARROW",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "In the given graph, the order of filterability is A > B > C, which likely indicates that the substances are Polycationic, Neutral, Polyanionic. The glomerular filtration barrier is negatively charged, which will repel most of the negative-charged (anionic substances). Whereas, the cationic substances are easily filtered. Hence, the order of filterability would be: Polycationic > Neutral > Polyanionic, represented by A, B, and C in the graph shown. The glomerular filtration barrier consists of: Endothelium of the capillary, Basement membrane: Lamina densa - electron-dense layer. It contains type IV collagen, Lamina rara interna - contains glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate which has a negative charge, and Lamina rara externa - contains glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate which has a negative charge, and a layer of epithelial cells (podocytes) surrounding the outer surface of the capillary basement membrane. The capillary endothelium is perforated by thousands of small holes called fenestrae, which measure from 4 nm up to 8 nm. Therefore, neutral substances with molecular diameters of less than 4 nm are freely filtered, and filtration of those with diameters of more than 8 nm approaches zero. However, in addition to the size of the particles, the filtration also depends mainly on the charge of the particle being filtered. The glomerular capillary wall consists of highly negatively charged proteins called sialoproteins, which repel the negatively charged substances (anions). The property can be studied by using charged dextran. When the filtration of the negatively and positively charged dextrans was studied, the results indicated that the negatively charged dextrans in the blood are repelled, with the result that filtration of anionic substances 4 nm in diameter is less than half that of neutral substances of the same size. This explains why albumin, despite having an effective molecular diameter of approximately 7 nm, has a very low filtration rate.",
