Due to the obstruction of the airways and because they collapse moreeasily than normal airways, the maximum expiratory flow rate is greatly reduced (But, total lungcapacity and residual volume is increased) which is shown in the green curve below.Other options given above will cause constricted lungs where the lungs cannot expand to a normalmaximum volume.
