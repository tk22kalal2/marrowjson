      "explanation": "Glucose is absorbed in the intestine by secondary active transport.On the basolateral side, there is active transport of sodium ions out of the cell into the interstitialfluid. This depletes sodium inside the cell. Because of this Na+ concentration difference, moreNa+ binds to the SGLT on the luminal side. This increases the affinity of SGLT for glucose andglucose binds to it.Then, both the Na+ and glucose are transported together to the interior of the cell. Thus, glucoseis absorbed in the intestine by secondary active transport. The energy for glucose transport isprovided indirectly, by the active transport of Na+ out of the cell. The glucose moves out of thecell into the blood across the basolateral membrane by facilitated diffusion mediated via GLUT.586Na+SGLT 1Glucose/GalactoseGlucose absorptionNa+-K+ATPaseNa+Glucose8K+ATPFructoseGLUT 5FructoseGLUT2LumenNaEnterocyteBlood(Basolateral)OMARROWK+",

        "C": "CCK",
        "D": "Ghrelin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The hormone secreted by the stomach that increases food intake is ghrelin.Ghrelin, the hunger hormone is produced by the endocrine cells in the oxyntic glands of thestomach. It increases food intake. Its levels increase during fasting, peaks just before thebeginning of food intake, or when the person is expecting a meal. The levels fall within 1 hour ofthe start of feeding.Option A: Orexin is synthesized from lateral hypothalamic neurons. It increases food intake.Option B: Leptin is produced by adipocytes. It decreases food intake.Option C: CCK is released from the small intestine. It decreases food intake.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Ghrelin increases gastric acid secretion.Ghrelin is mainly produced by the endocrine cells in the oxyntic gland area of the stomach. It isalso secreted by the pancreas and adrenal glands.Functions:• Increases appetite/food intake (orexigenic)•• Inhibits leptin release595• Stimulates growth hormone secretion by directly acting on anterior pituitary (ghrelin-growthhormone-releasing peptide)• Increases gastric acid secretion and gastrointestinal motility to prepare the body for food intake•Regulates the distribution and rate of use of energy",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "A patient with a BMI of 34 kg/m2 is categorized as obese. Leptin levels are high in obesity.Leptin is an appetite-suppressing hormone synthesized from adipocytes. The larger the fat stores,the more leptin is released into the blood.Leptin resistance in obese persons may be due to its failure to cross the blood-brain barrier andreach the hypothalamus to serve its appetite-suppressing function.Note: A recent study has indicated that triglycerides which are elevated in obesity, inhibit thetransport of leptin across the blood-brain barrier.",
