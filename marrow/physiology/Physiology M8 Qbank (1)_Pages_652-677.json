      "explanation": "The actual renal threshold is about 200 mg/dL (i.e., 2 g/L) (1g/L=100mg/dl) and the transportmaximum for glucose is 375 mg/min.For substances that are actively reabsorbed or secreted, there is a limit to the rate at whichthe solute can be transported, which is referred to as the transport maximum. This limit is due tosaturation of the specific transport systems involved.Normally, measurable glucose does not appear in the urine because essentially all thefiltered glucose is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule.The transport maximum for glucose is about 375 mg/min, whereas the filtered load of glucose isonly about 125 mg/min. With large increases in GFR and/or plasma glucose concentration.that increase the filtered load of glucose above 375 mg/min, the excess glucose filtered is notreabsorbed and passes into the urine.When the plasma glucose concentration is 100 mg/100 ml and the filtered load is at its normallevel (125 mg/min) there is no loss of glucose in the urine. However, when the plasmaconcentration of glucose rises above about 200 mg/100 ml, increasing the filtered load to about250 mg/min, a small amount of glucose begins to appear in the urine. This point is termed as thethreshold for glucose.Splay is due to separation between filtered load and exceretion.

After this point, no matter how much the PAHconcentration increases, there can be no further increase in the secretion rate.Excretion. For a secreted substance such as PAH, excretion is the sum of filtration andsecretion. At low PAH concentrations (below Tm), excretion increases steeply with increases inplasma PAH concentration because both filtration and secretion are increasing. At PAHconcentrations above Tm, excretion increases less steeply (and parallels the curve for filtration)because only the filtration component increases as concentration increases; secretion is alreadysaturated.",

They detect sodiumconcentration of the fluid in the tubule (chemoreceptor). In response to elevated sodium, themacula densa cells trigger the contraction of the afferent arteriole, reducing the flow of blood tothe glomerulus and the glomerular filtration rate. This happens as follows: When there isincreased sodium, there is increased sodium-potassium ATPase activity which leads to increasedATP hydrolysis causing more adenosine formation. The adenosine receptors on the macula densacells stimulate it to release more calcium, so that there is vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole,thereby decreasing the GFR.•Lacis cells: Extraglomerular mesangial cells situated between afferent and efferent arteriole.Granular cells/JG cells: Modified smooth muscle cells of the afferent arteriole, they secreterenin.
