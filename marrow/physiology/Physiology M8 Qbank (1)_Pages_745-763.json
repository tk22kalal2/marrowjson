      "explanation": "In the given scenario, increased formation of 24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol will take place.Infusion of calcium chloride solution will lead to raised calcium concentration in blood. At highercalcium concentrations, PTH is also suppressed. So the 25-hydroxycholecalciferol is converted to adifferent compound: 24,25dihydroxycholecalciferol that has almost no vitamin D effect.When plasma calcium concentration is high, formation of 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol is alsogreatly depressed. Lack of 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol, in turn, decreases the absorption ofcalcium from the intestines, bones, and renal tubules, thus causing the calcium ion concentrationto fall back toward its normal level.Option A: Since PTH levels are supressed bone demineralisation does not take place.Option B: Calcitonin is a calcium regulatory hormone whose level increases when the calciumconcentration in plasma is high.Option C: Calcium ions are a part of the coagulation cascade and the blood coaguability eitherincreases or remains the same with high plasma Ca+2 levels.",

When PTH binds to these receptors, osteoblastsrelease cytokines like RANK-ligand and M-CSF. These cytokines allow the differentiation ofmacrophages to osteoclasts.Osteoclasts, in turn, cut the collagen in the bone, which is bound to calcium. This causes therelease of calcium, phosphorus, and collagen breakdown products in the blood.Osteoblasts produce osteoprotegerin (OPG), or osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor, a cytokinethat inhibits bone resorption by preventing interaction of RANKL with its receptor. PTHdecreases the production of osteoprotegerin (OPG).Glucocorticoids promote osteoclast activity and increase bone resorption by increasing RANKLproduction and decreasing the formation of OPG. On the other hand, the hormone estrogenstimulates OPG production.",

      "question": "Which of the following is false regarding confounders affecting serum calcium level?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Total calcium concentration is altered by variations in the serum albumin concentration.",
        "B": "Forearm exercise can lead to falsely elevated ionized calcium levels",
        "C": "Hemoconcentration due to tourniquet results in a rise of serum calcium",
        "D": "Acidosis causes a decrease in the ionized calcium levels"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Acidosis does not cause a decrease in the ionized calcium levels. Rather, alkalosis causes adecrease in the ionized calcium levels.Plasma proteins are more ionized when the pH is high (alkalosis), providing more protein anionsto bind with and sequester free Ca2+. This causes a decrease in ionized calcium and may triggersymptoms of hypocalcemia.Option A: Total calcium concentration is altered by variations in the serum albumin concentrationas 41% of calcium is bound to plasma proteins like albumin, hence changes in albuminconcentration affects the serum calcium levels. The corrected calcium levels can be calculated as:Corrected calcium (mg/dL) = measured total Ca (mg/dL) + 0.8 (4.0 - serum albumin [g/dL]), where4.0 represents the average albumin level.Option B: Fist-clenching or forearm exercise can lead to falsely elevated ionized (free) calciumlevels.Option C: A tourniquet is usually avoided while drawing blood for calcium measurements sincehemoconcentration also leads to an increase in serum calcium levels.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Osteoblasts are involved in the initiation and control of osteoclastic activity.Osteoblasts produce receptor activator for nuclear factor кB ligand (RANKL) and macrophagecolony stimulating factor (M-CSF), which are necessary for formation of mature osteoclasts andhence osteoclastic activity.Specific receptors for parathormone are present only on the osteoblasts and not on osteoclasts.",

        "A": "Parathyroid adenoma",
        "B": "Lithium intake",
        "C": "Vitamin D deficiency",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Parathyroid adenoma is a benign tumor of the parathyroid gland, which causes primaryhyperparathyroidism (not secondary).Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by high levels of parathyroid hormone, tocompensate for the low levels of serum calcium, due to some other underlying condition.Causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism, include:• Chronic kidney disease: The damaged kidneys are unable to produce sufficient amounts of theactive form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. This further causes hypocalcemia andtriggers PTH secretion.•Vitamin D deficiency: Causes hypocalcemia, which triggers the increased secretion of PTH.• Lithium: May cause an increased set-point of calcium for parathyroid hormone suppression,which leads to parathyroid hyperplasia.763",
