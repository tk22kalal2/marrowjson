      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Transport of CO is diffusion limited because of the high affinity of CO to hemoglobin. Diffusion across the alveolocapillary membrane: • Blood takes 0.75s to traverse pulmonary capillaries. • CO diffuses into blood and combines with Hb with very high affinity. Thus, the partial pressure of CO doesn't rise (Only dissolved form of gas can increase the partial pressure; gas which combines with Hb or plasma proteins cannot). Partial pressure gradient necessary for diffusion of CO is maintained for the whole 0.75s and hence it is diffusion limited. • In the case of N2O, it does not react and reaches equilibrium in about 0.1s. The amount of N2O taken up is not limited by diffusion but by the amount of blood flowing through the pulmonary capillaries; that is, it is flow-limited. • O2 is intermediate between N2O and CO; it is taken up by hemoglobin, but much less avidly than CO, and it reaches equilibrium with capillary blood in about 0.3 s. Thus, its uptake is perfusion-limited. In the case of perfusion-limited gases, an increase in pulmonary blood flow increases the amount of gas transferred. Hence, O2 transport increases with an increase in pulmonary blood flow.",

      "explanation": "A relaxed (R) configuration exposes more O2 binding sites. The quaternary structure of hemoglobin determines its affinity for O2. In deoxyhemoglobin, the globin units are tightly bound in a tense (T) configuration, which reduces the affinity of the molecule for O2. When O2 is first bound, the bonds holding the globin units are released, producing a relaxed (R) configuration, which exposes more O2 binding sites. The net result is a 500-fold increase in O2. In tissues, these reactions are reversed, resulting in O2 dissociation. Oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin: Deoxyhemoglobin - Oxyhemoglobin. Decreasing pH, increasing 2,3-DPG, and falling [O2] favor the T configuration, while rising [O2] favors the R configuration.",

It has a characteristic sigmoid shape due to theT-R interconversion. Combination of the first heme in the Hb molecule with O2 increases theaffinity of the second heme for O2 and oxygenation of the second increases the affinity of thethird, and so on, such that the affinity of Hb for the fourth 02 molecule is many times that for thefirst (Positive Co-operative Effect).Option C: The effect of PCO2 and pH on the O2-hemoglobin dissociation curve is called the Bohreffect.Option D: O2 bound to hemoglobin changes its affinity for CO2, such that when less O2 is bound,the affinity of hemoglobin for CO2 increases.

      "explanation": "Percent saturation: 100-80, 60-40, 20-0. The oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve is explained by the Bohr effect. When the metabolic activity of tissues increases, the production of CO2 increases. This CO2 diffuses into the blood and, in turn, raises the blood H2CO3 and causes an increase in the H+ concentration and a decrease in pH. This decreases the affinity of Hb for O2, shifting the O2-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right. This facilitates the unloading of O2 in the tissues. The effect of PCO2 and pH on the O2-hemoglobin dissociation curve is called the Bohr Effect. Conversely, in the lungs, CO2 diffuses from the blood to the alveoli, and the H+ concentration decreases, and the O2-hemoglobin dissociation curve shifts to the left, increasing the affinity of Hb to O2. Note: The double Bohr effect occurring in the placenta: the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve of fetal blood and maternal blood move in opposite directions. Mechanism: The fetal blood entering the placenta carries large amounts of carbon dioxide, but most of it diffuses from the fetal blood into the maternal blood. Fetal blood - loss of CO2 - reduced H+ - shift to left - loading of O2, i.e., oxygenation of fetal Hb. Maternal blood - increase in CO2 - increase in H+ - shift to the right - release of oxygen.",

The β chains of adult hemoglobin (hemoglobin A) are replaced by γ chains in HbF. This modification results in increased affinity of hemoglobin for O2, a left shift of the O2-hemoglobin dissociation curve, and decreased P50. The mechanism of the left shift is based on the binding of 2,3-DPG. 2,3-DPG does not bind as avidly to the γ chains of HbF as it binds to the β chains of hemoglobin A. When less 2,3-DPG is bound, the affinity for O2 increases and facilitates the movement of O2 from the mother to the fetus. This increased affinity is beneficial to the fetus, whose PaO2 is low (approximately 40 mm Hg).",

The equilibrium between Hb and O2 can beunderstood from the following equation:HbO2 + 2,3-DPG Hb-2,3-DPG + O2In stored blood, the 2,3 DPG levels usually fall. As a result, stored blood releases less oxygen tothe tissues than the normal circulating blood, thus limiting its use in hypoxic patients (Eg:anaemia).However, such a fall in 2,3 DPG is less when it is stored in a phosphate-containing solution likeCPDA (Citrate, phosphate, dextrose, adenine), rather than ACD (Acid citrate dextrose). Therefore,the blood stored in CPDA, in comparison with blood stored in ACD has:•Higher 2,3 DPG concentration• More amount of deoxygenated blood bound to 2,3 DPG• Decreased affinity of Hb to the oxygen.••• Increased release of oxygen to the tissues.• Raised P50 (PO2 at which Hb is half saturated)• Shift in O2-Hb dissociation curve to the right",

      "explanation": "The oxygen carrying capacity of a boy with haemoglobin 14g/dl is 18.When blood is saturated with 100% O2, the haemoglobin is also 100% saturated and each gram ofnormal haemoglobin contains 1.39 mL of O2.However, blood normally contains some inactive haemoglobin derivatives, and the measuredvalue in vivo is thus slightly lower hence, each gram of haemoglobin in vivo contains 1.31 mL of02 (Hufner's constant).According to the above question, when Hb=14g/dl, O2= 1.31*14= 18.34The oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve•• Demonstrates a progressive increase in the percentage of haemoglobin bound with oxygen asblood Po2 increases, which is called the percent saturation of haemoglobin.414• Blood leaving the lungs and entering the systemic arteries usually has a Po2 of about 95 mm Hg,the usual oxygen saturation of systemic arterial blood averages 97 per cent.• Conversely, in normal venous blood returning from the peripheral tissues, the Po2 is about 40mm Hg, and the saturation of haemoglobin averages 75 per cent.12010080A left shift increaseshemoglobin affinityfor oxygen.(Causes: 2-3DPG, temperative, TpH).(% Fos84020A right shift reduceshemoglobin affinityfor oxygen.(Causes: 12-3DPG, temperative, pH)00204060PO280100120415",
