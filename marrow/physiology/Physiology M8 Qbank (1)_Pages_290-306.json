If the spindles onboth sides of each joint are activated at the same time, then reflex excitation of the skeletalmuscles on both sides of the joint increases, producing tight, tense muscles opposing each other atthe joint. The net effect is that the position of the joint becomes strongly stabilized.Any time a person must perform a muscle function that requires a high degree of delicate andexact positioning, the bulboreticular facilitatory region of the brain stem stabilizes the positions ofthe proximal joints.",

The resistance to flexion suddenly collapses, and the arm flexes. This sequence ofresistance followed by a sudden decrease in resistance when a limb is moved passively is known asthe clasp-knife effect because of its resemblance to the closing of a pocket knife.• Lengthening reaction: When the tension on the muscle becomes extreme, the inhibitory effectfrom the Golgi tendon organ leads to an instantaneous relaxation of the entire muscle.

An alternative treatment modality is being planned, whichemploys ablation of certain thalamic regions by neurosurgery. Which thalamic nucleus is thestereotaxic target for the neurosurgeons?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Centromedian",
        "B": "Ventrolateral",
        "C": "Ventroposterolateral",
        "D": "Ventromedial"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The ventrolateral thalamic nucleus is the stereotaxic target for the neurosurgeons to alleviatesymptoms in Parkinson's disease refractory to levodopa.•The two major outputs of the basal ganglia are from GPi and substantia nigra pars reticulata.Both are inhibitory (GABAergic) and both project to the ventrolateral and ventroanteriorthalamus. From the thalamus, there is an excitatory (presumably glutamate) projection to theprefrontal and premotor cortex. This completes a full cortical-basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical loop.Therefore stereotactic ablation of ventrolateral thalamic nucleus helps in alleviation of symptomsin parkinson's disease refractory to levodopa.306",
