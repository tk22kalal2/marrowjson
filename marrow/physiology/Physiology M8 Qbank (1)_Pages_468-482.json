      "explanation": "Factor 2 would have decreased gamma carboxyglutamate residue in a patient on warfarin therapy.Activation of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, X is done by carboxylation of their glutamateresidues. This is done by the enzyme y-glutamyl carboxylase with the reduced form of vitamin Kas a co-factor.This reduced form of vitamin K needs to be constantly recycled back from its oxidized form for thereaction to continue. This recycling is done by the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase. Thisenzyme is inhibited by warfarin.Hence, warfarin indirectly inhibits the y-carboxylation of vitamin K dependent clotting factors- Factors II, VII, IX, X by directly inhibiting vitamin K epoxide reductase.

From the umbilical vein, 50% of the blood enters the hepatic circulation and 50% bypasses the liver to enter the inferior vena cava. From here, the blood enters the heart via the right atrium. The right atrium also receives deoxygenated blood from the superior vena cava. This mixed blood is distributed to the body via the aorta.
