      "explanation": "Emeiocytosis requires Ca2+ directly.Emeiocytosis is the movement of secretory granules to the plasma membrane of the cell, fusion ofthe granule surface membrane with the cell membrane, rupture of membranes, and liberation ofgranular contents into the pericapillary space.Insulin secretion (as shown in the image below):53• Glucose enters B cells by GLUT-2 transporters.• It is phosphorylated and metabolized to pyruvate (Pyr) in the cytoplasm.•The Pyr enters the mitochondria and is metabolized via the citric acid cycle. The ATP formed byoxidative phosphorylation inhibits ATP-sensitive K+ channels, reducing K+ efflux.• This depolarizes the B cell, and Ca2+ influx is increased. The Ca2+ stimulates the release ofinsulin by exocytosis. Glutamate (Glu) is also formed, and this primes secretory granules,preparing them for exocytosis.It is promoted by Ca2+, ↑ K+It is inhibited by Mg2+, K+ depletion.The process of emeiocytosis for insulin secretion is depicted in the image below.Emeiocytosis for insulin secretionGLUT2RespirationGlucoseATP+ATP ADP ratio closesKATP channel,causing depolarisationATPproductionCaCa2+ activates insulin geneexpression via CREB(Calcium ResponsiveElement Binding Protein)Exocytosis of stored insulinMARROW54VoltagegatedCa2+channels",

      "question": "Detailed ExplanationsLipid-soluble substances are transported across the cell membrane via diffusion.••The rate of diffusion depends directly on lipid solubility.Characteristics of simple diffusion• The only form of transport that is not carrier-mediated• Occurs down an electrochemical gradient (\"downhill\")• Does not require metabolic energy and therefore is passive•Permeability••• Describes the ease with which a solute diffuses through a membraneDepends on the characteristics of the solute and the membrane• Small hydrophobic solutes (e.g., O2) have the highest permeabilities in lipid membranes.•Hydrophilic solutes (e.g., Na+) must cross cell membranes through water-filled channels, orpores. If the solute is an ion, then its flux will depend on both the concentration difference and thepotential difference across the membrane.Solution to Question 2:Among the following substances, oxygen diffuses more rapidly through phospholipid membranesas it is a lipid-soluble substance.Phospholipid membranes are:• Permeable to lipid-soluble substances (e.g., O2, CO2, NH3, steroid hormones)• Impermeable to water-soluble substances (e.g., Na+, Cl-, glucose)•Semipermeable to waterSolution to Question 3:Fick's law of diffusion explains passive diffusion along the concentration gradient.Fick's law of diffusion: The magnitude of the diffusing tendency is directly proportional to thecross-sectional area across which diffusion is taking place and the concentration gradient, orchemical gradient, which is the difference in concentration of the diffusing substance divided bythe thickness of the membrane.41Solution to Question 4:The net effect on the diffusion is, it becomes 3x.The magnitude of the diffusion:where,•·J=net rate of diffusion• D = diffusion coefficient• A = area of the membrane• Ax = thickness of the membrane or the distance the molecule must travel across for diffusion• Ac = concentration gradientIn the condition mentioned above, the surface area, the thickness of the membrane andintracellular concentration becomes doubled. This means,• A is doubled = 2A• Ax is doubled = 2Ax••IC is doubled. 10x2= 20 units; EC is 5 units.So, Ac = 20-5 = 15. Ac was 5 with the original concentrations. Hence Ac has been tripled.Now,J=-D x 2A x 3Ac/2Ax = 3 x [DA Ac/Ax]Therefore the diffusion of the substance increases by three-fold.2nd method :JDA (Ac/Ax)After applying changes, Ac = intracellular conc. - extracellular conc.Therefore, J1 = - DA (5/Ax)=10-5= 5After appropriate doublings,New intracellular conc. = 10* 2 = 20New extracellular conc. =5 (since no change) Ac = 20-5 = 15Therefore, J2 = - D 2*A (15 / 2* Ax)= - D A (15/Ax)Now,J2 / J1 = [-DA (15/Ax) ]/[ = - DA (5/Ax)]J2J115/5= 3Therefore the diffusion of the substance increases by three-fold.Solution to Question 5:42Simple diffusion is not carrier-mediated transport hence do not follow saturation kinetics.• Facilitated diffusion, primary active transport, and secondary active transport all involve integralmembrane proteins and are called carrier-mediated transport.•• All carrier-mediated transport system follows saturation kinetics.The figure shows that as the concentration of the diffusing substance increases, the rate ofsimple diffusion continues to increase proportionately, but in the case of facilitated diffusion, therate of diffusion cannot rise greater than the transport maximum (Tm). Tm is analogous tothe maximum velocity (Vmax) level in enzyme kinetics.Rate of diffusionVmaxSimple diffusionFacilitated diffusionConcentration of substanceOMARROWSolution to Question 6:When carrier proteins help in the movement of substances in the direction of their chemical orelectrical gradients (downhill movement), no energy input is required and the process is calledfacilitated diffusion.Examples• GLUT• Urea Transporters:• UTA 1, 2, 3, 4 in Kidney• UTB in RBC• Amino Acid TransportersOther options are wrong because:• Facilitated diffusion is a type of passive transport.• It follows saturation kinetics.• No energy input is required in facilitated diffusion.43Rate of diffusionVmaxSimple diffusionFacilitated diffusionConcentration of substanceOMARROWSolution to Question 7:The movement of water across the membrane is most affected by osmotic pressure.Osmotic pressure is the pressure that would have to be applied to prevent the movement of watermolecules to the more concentrated solution i.e. to a region in which there is higher concentrationof a solute to which the membrane is impermeable.AOsmotic pressureRRSemipermeablemembraneOMARROW• Osmotic pressure is calculated by Vant Hoff's law.Solution to Question 8:Bcm H₂OOsmoticpressure44Difference between osmolarity &amp; osmolality:•Osmolarity is the number of osmoles per litre of solution,• Osmolality is the number of osmoles per kilogram of solvent.•Therefore, osmolarity is affected by the volume of the various solutes in the solution and thetemperature, while the osmolality is not.Solution to Question 9:Passive transfer of the only solvent occurs in Osmosis.The diffusion of solvent molecules into a region in which there is a higher concentration of asolute to which the membrane is impermeable is called osmosis.Note: Membrane is impermeable to the solute.Solution to Question 10:The absorption of salicylates like aspirin in the stomach is an example of nonionic diffusion.• Some weak acids and bases are quite soluble in cell membranes in the undissociated form, butthey cannot cross membranes in the charged (i.e. dissociated) form. Consequently, molecules ofthe undissociated substance diffuse from one side of the membrane to the other and thendissociate. This phenomenon is called nonionic diffusion.Examples• Ammonia excretion in collecting ducts• Excretion of weak acids and bases in the kidney•Absorption of salicylates in the stomach• Absorption of bile acids in the distal ileumSolution to Question 11:When a carrier protein transports substances against their electrical and chemical gradients(uphill movement) it requires energy and this type of transport is called active transport.45Active transportActive transportPrimaryRRDirect input of metabolicenergy in the form of ATPSecondaryTransport of 2 or moresubstances is coupledMetabolic energy is derivedindirectly from the Na+gradient, maintained by theNa K pumpOMARROWSolution to Question 12:The movement of calcium from the cytosol to the extracellular space takes place by primary activetransport.Two primary active transport calcium pumps maintain low intracellular calcium levels. Onepumps calcium ions to the extracellular space and another to the sarcoplasmic reticulum.Calcium transport also takes place via secondary active transport. A sodium-calciumexchanger/antiporter moves sodium ions to the interior and calcium ions to the exterior.Solution to Question 13:Na+- K+ ATPase or Na+-K+ ATP pump catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and uses theenergy to extrude three Na+ from the cell and take two K+ into the cell for each molecule of ATPhydrolyzed.Sodium-Potassium Pump/ Na+- K+ Pump:•Carrier protein located on the plasma membrane of all cells• Pumps 3 Na+ out of the cell &amp; 2 K+ into the cell (coupling ratio 3:2)• 2 separate globular proteins:•• Larger-subunit &amp; smaller- ẞ subunit, ° subunit concerned with Na+- K+ transport•Binding sites on ° subunit:• 3 intracellular sites- for Na+, ATP, and one phosphorylation site• 2 extracellular sites- for K+ and oubain46PlasmamembraneMechanism Of ActionExtracellular space-SodiumNa+CytoplasmATPPhosphateADPSodium-potassium pump3Na+ binds to a subunitATP ADPP binds to Na+-K+ ATPase-PotassiumK*Change in a subunit configurationMANa+ extruded out of cellSw W2K+ binds to extracellular sitea subunit dephosphorylationa subunit returns to original configurationK+ released into the cellOMARROWNa*K*ConcentrationFunctions:• Controlling Cell Volume.•Electrogenic Nature- maintains Resting membrane potential• The energy from the Na+-K+ pump also indirectly serves as the energy source for secondaryactive transport.Regulation:•Pump activity is altered by second messenger molecules eg. cAMP, DAG• Stimulated by thyroid hormones, insulin and aldosterone• Inhibition by dopamine, digitalis glycosides, ouabain47Solution to Question 14:In active transport the energy is provided almost exclusively by the hydrolysis of ATP. Hencemany carrier molecules are ATPases (eg. Na+-K+-ATPase), enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis ofATP.PRIMARY ACTIVE TRANSPORTRequiresdirect input of metabolic energyin the form of adenosine triphosphate(ATP)",
