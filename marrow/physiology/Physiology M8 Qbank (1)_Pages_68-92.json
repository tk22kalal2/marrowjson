If thedye x have been used properly, for a normal person then the value would come around 3 L• Dye y crosses capillaries, which means it can cross any blood vessel. This property is used tomeasure the value of ECF. If the dye y is given, for a normal person then the value would comearound 14L•Thus if dye y is given in place of x, then the value would be 14 instead of 3 which is a false andthe obtained value is high when compared to normal value• Therefore the answer is falsely high.83",

His serum osmolality will be significantly raised.The principal determinants of osmolality of serum are the concentrations of sodium, glucose andurea (blood urea nitrogen or BUN).Osmolality is defined as a measure of the osmoles (Osm) of solute per kilogram of solvent(osmol/kg or Osm/kg). The osmolality of the intracellular and extracellular fluids is maintainedbetween 290 and 310 mOsm in each compartment.",

They depict the change inplasma osmolality and plasma volume in various conditions.If a hypertonic solution is added to the extracellular fluid, the extracellular osmolarity increasesand causes osmosis of water out of the cells into the extracellular compartment•ECF osmolality increases. ECF volume increases.• As, ECF osmolality rises, fluid from ICF moves to ECF till osmotic equilibrium is established. So,• ICF osmolality rises. ICF volume decreases..Therefore, the net effect is an increase in extracellular volume (greater than the volume of fluidadded), a decrease in intracellular volume, and a rise in osmolarity in both compartments.Note: The dotted line in the diagram is the change after either addition or removal of fluidOsmolarity (mOsm/L)300200100",
