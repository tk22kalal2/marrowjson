      "explanation": "Among the given options, the least frequency of slow waves is seen in the stomach (4/min).606The Basal electrical rhythm (BER) also called slow-wave, is a rhythmic fluctuation of membranepotential in the gastrointestinal smooth muscle. It is initiated by the interstitial cells of Cajal. Themembrane potential fluctuates between -65mV and -45mV.The BER is seen in all sites of gastrointestinal smooth muscle except in the esophagus andproximal stomach.The rate of BER in various sites is as follows:Stomach: 4/min• Duodenum: 12/min• Distal ileum: 8/min• Cecum: 2/min•Sigmoid colon: 6/minThe BER does not cause contraction of the smooth muscle. However, when the BER issuperimposed by the spike potentials, it increases muscle tension.Acetylcholine causes an increase in the number of spike potentials and muscletension. Epinephrine causes a decrease in the number of spike potentials and muscle tension.Basal electrical rhythm of the GITSpike potentials100 microVolts10 secondsOMARROWMuscle contraction can occur only when the motor stimulus is provided during the depolarisationpart of the BER.Thus, BER does not cause muscle contraction by itself, but controls the rate and organization sitesof the muscle contractions, as in coordination of the peristaltic activity and setting the rhythm ofsegmentation.",

      "explanation": "Among the given options, the frequency of 'slow waves' is maximum in the ileum (8/min).607Normal intestinal motility is determined by two patterns of electrical activity - slow waves andspike potentials.Slow waves, also known as basic electrical rhythm are partial depolarizations of smooth musclecells, spreading along the GIT. They originate from the interstitial cells of Cajal. The smoothmuscles are in a hyperpolarized state, having a resting membrane potential of -50 to -60mV.These waves are not action potentials themselves and they do not cause any contractions. Slowwaves raise the membrane potential by 5-15mV, bringing it closer to the threshold enabling spikepotential (true action potential) to occur. Therefore, they set the basic rhythm of GIT.",

      "explanation": "Gastric emptying is mainly regulated by enteric reflexes. Regulation of gastric emptying is mainly by the inhibitory feedback signals from the duodenum that include the enterogastric reflex and hormonal feedback by cholecystokinin. Enterogastric reflex: When food enters the duodenum, multiple nervous reflexes are initiated from the duodenal wall. They strongly inhibit the pyloric pump propulsive contractions and increase the tone of the pyloric sphincter. These reflexes are mediated by three routes: directly from the duodenum to the stomach through the enteric nervous system in the gut wall (major role); through inhibitory sympathetic nerve fibers to the stomach (minor role); and vagus nerves to the brain stem where they inhibit the normal excitatory signals transmitted to the stomach (minor role). Hormonal feedback: Cholecystokinin is released from the mucosa of the jejunum in response to fatty substances in the chyme. This hormone acts as an inhibitor to block increased stomach motility caused by gastrin.",

      "explanation": "While doing sigmoidoscopy if the rectum is inflated with gas, increased peristalsis is seen inthe distal colon.The distention of the rectal wall initiates afferent signals. These signals spread through themyenteric plexus to initiate peristaltic waves in the descending colon, sigmoid (distal colon), andrectum.",

The enteric nervous system, which includes the submucosal plexus or Meissner's plexus and the myenteric plexus or Auerbach's plexus, is present in the submucosa and between the longitudinal and circular muscle layers, respectively. It controls gastrointestinal secretion and movement.",
