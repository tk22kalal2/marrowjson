Therefore, far more sodium ions flow to the interior of the fiber thando potassium ions to the exterior. This causes the membrane potential to become positive at theaction potential onset.When the membrane potential rises from -90 millivolts toward zero, this voltage change causes aconformational change in the K+ channels which allows increased potassium efflux. Then, thesodium channels begin to close and the potassium channels begin to open, and potassiumconductance begins to increase (and sodium conductance decreases).The increased flow of K+ out of the cell causes membrane repolarization. The slow return of theK+ channels to the closed state explains the after-hyperpolarization followed by a return to theresting membrane potential.",

The direction of the current is either• same as the direction of positive charge (eg, Na+ )108•opposite to the direction of negative charge (eg, Cl- )•opposite to the direction of electronsSince Na+ moves in, there is a net inward current.Since the RMP increases, the cell interior becomes less negative.In response to a depolarizing stimulus, some of the voltage-gated Na+ channels open and Na+enters the cell and the membrane is brought to its threshold potential.

The entry of Na+ causes the opening of more voltage-gated Na+ channels andfurther depolarization, setting up a positive feedback loop. The rapid upstroke in the membranepotential ensues.The membrane potential moves toward the equilibrium potential for Na+ (+60 mV) but does notreach it during the action potential, primarily because the increase in Na+ conductance isshort-lived. The Na+ channels rapidly enter a closed state called the inactivated state and remainin this state for a few milliseconds.In addition, the direction of the electrical gradient for Na+ is reversed during the overshootbecause the membrane potential is reversed, and this limits Na+ influx; also the voltage-gated K+channels open. These factors contribute to repolarization. The opening of voltage-gated K+channels is slower and more prolonged than the opening of the Na+ channels. The net movementof positive charge out of the cell due to K+ efflux at this time helps complete the process ofrepolarization.109The slow return of the K+ channels to the closed state also explains the after-hyperpolarization,followed by a return to the resting membrane potential.Thus, voltage-gated K+ channels bring the action potential to an end and cause closure of theirgates through a negative feedback process.Note: Na+ channels: Positive feedback loop; K+ channels: Negative feedback loop.Changes in membrane potential during anaction potentialExcitabilityNa/K+ChannelsMembrane potential30-BothchannelsclosedNachannelsopenedNaKchannels closed,channels openNa channels reset.K channels remain openNago goK'HighKIncreasing2-55-70--0ZeroAbsolute refractory periodBothchannelsclosed00-00-0000Relative refractory periodTime (milliseconds)Action potentialOMARROW7Na—K'Feedback control involtage-gated Na channelsDepolarisingstimulusVoltage-gated Na+channels openNa+ channelinactivationPositivefeedback+PNaDepolarization ofmembrane potential+Na+ intothe cellOMARROW4Highlon permeability110Feedback control involtage-gated K channelsNa+ influxMembranedepolarizationMANegativefeedbackMembranerepolarizationVoltage-gated K+channels openRWIncreasedPKK+ flows out of the cellOMARROW",

Such conduction is called orthodromic. Conduction in the opposite direction is calledantidromic. Under natural conditions, impulse conduction is normally only orthodromic.Antidromic conduction is usually only seen when a nerve fibre is stimulated under artificialconditions.In a chemical synapse, conduction is always orthodromic. As the transmission in a chemicalsynapse is due to the release of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic membrane which activatereceptors on the postsynaptic membrane, antidromic conduction (i.e. from the postsynapticmembrane to presynaptic membrane) is not possible.

Summation occurs in two ways:•⚫ by increasing the number of motor units contracting simultaneously, which is multiple ■bersummations.• by increasing the frequency of contraction, which is called frequency summation and can lead totetanization.When the frequency of a contraction reaches a critical level, the successive contractions eventuallyfuse together, and the whole muscle contraction appears to be completely smooth and continuous,124this is called tetanization.
