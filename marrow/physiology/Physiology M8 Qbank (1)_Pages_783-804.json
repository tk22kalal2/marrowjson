In spontaneously ovulating species with estrous cycles, such as the rat, no episodic vaginal bleeding occurs, but the underlying endocrine events are essentially the same as those in the menstrual cycle. In other species, ovulation is induced by copulation (reflex ovulation).",

      "explanation": "Progesterone is mainly responsible for the maintenance of endometrial thickness in thepost-ovulatory phase.The menstrual cycle consists of three phases: the menstrual phase, the proliferative phase, and thesecretory, or progestational, phaseMenstrual phase: This phase is characterized by the discharge of blood and endometrial debrisfrom the vagina.•It coincides with the end of the ovarian luteal phase and onset of a new follicular phase.• Withdrawal of progesterone on the degeneration of the corpus luteum (CL) leads simultaneouslyto sloughing of the endometrium (menstruation) and development of new follicles in the ovaryunder the influence of rising gonadotropic hormone levelsProliferative Phase: Thus, menstrual flow ceases, and the proliferative phase of the uterine cyclebegins concurrently with the last portion of the ovarian follicular phase.• When the menstrual flow ceases, a thin endometrial layer less than 1-mm thick remains.Estrogen stimulates proliferation of epithelial cells, glands, and blood vessels in the endometrium,increasing this lining to a thickness of 3 to 5 mm.• The estrogen-dominant proliferative phase lasts from the end of menstruation to ovulation. Peakestrogen levels trigger the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge responsible for ovulation.Secretory or Progestational Phase: After ovulation, when a new corpus luteum is formed, theuterus enters the secretory, or progestational, phase, which coincides in time with the ovarianluteal phase. The corpus luteum secretes large amounts of progesterone and estrogen.Progesterone converts the thickened, estrogen-primed endometrium to a richly vascularized,glycogen-filled tissue.•This period is called either the secretory phase, because the endometrial glands are activelysecreting glycogen into the uterine lumen for early nourishment of a developing embryo before it795implants, or the progestational (\"before pregnancy\") phase, referring to the development of a lushendometrial lining capable of supporting an early embryo after implantation.• If fertilization and implantation do not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates and a newfollicular phase and menstrual phase begin again.",

This progesterone acts on the hypothalamusand increases basal body temperature. Charting the daily basal body temperature will show anincrease of approximately 0.5 to 1 degrees fahrenheit shortly after ovulation.Since the rise in basal body temperature coincides with ovulation, abstaining from sexualintercourse until at least 3 days after the woman's temperature has risen above her regulartemperature significantly lowers the chance of pregnancy.

It isprimarily secreted from ovaries.Estrone is synthesized from dehydroepiandrosterone in adipose tissue stroma. Estrone is theabundant circulating form of estrogen in postmenopausal women.In pregnancy, the placenta uses dehydroepiandrosterone and its 16 alpha hydroxyl derivative toform large amounts of estrone and estriol.",
