      "question": "Which among the following has the highest airway resistance?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Alveolar duct",
        "B": "Bronchi",
        "C": "Respiratory bronchioles",
        "D": "Small bronchioles"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Among the given options, bronchi (medium-sized airway) offer maximum resistance. The best answer here is bronchi, as all the other options suggest smaller airways, while bronchi are the only medium-sized airway. Airflow can be derived from the Poiseuille-Hagen formula: Q = π * ΔP * r^4 / (8 * η * L), where Q is the flow rate, π is the pi symbol, ΔP is the pressure difference, r is the radius, η is viscosity, and L is length. Also, flow rate (Q) = pressure difference (ΔP) / resistance (R). Therefore, substituting this in the Poiseuille-Hagen formula, ΔP / R = π * ΔP * r^4 / (8 * η * L), 1 / R = π * r^4 / (8 * η * L), R = 8 * η * L / (π * r^4). Therefore, it can be derived that airway resistance is inversely proportional to the radius by the power of four. With the Poiseuille-Hagen formula, we might feel that the smallest airways are the major site of resistance. However, the contribution by the smallest airways is very little to the overall total resistance. This is because the airway branches in each generation exist in parallel rather than in series. As the parallel branching increases, the resistance decreases (total cross-sectional diameter of small airways put together is high). Thus, the overall resistance of the small airways is very small. Also, airflow velocity decreases substantially as the effective cross-sectional area increases (i.e., the flow becomes laminar). Other factors affecting airway resistance include: lung volume, as lung volume increases, the resistance decreases, and vice versa. Lung volume increases the transairway pressure, thus increasing the caliber of the airway. Airway mucus, edema, and contraction of bronchial smooth muscle increase the airway resistance. Its clinical application is seen in asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. The density and viscosity of inspired gas also contribute to airway resistance. A gas with more density imparts more resistance.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Surfactant helps to prevent alveolar collapse according to Law of Laplace. (Not Bernoulli's)Physiologic advantages of surfactant• By reducing surface tension it increases lung compliance••• Reduces the lung's tendency to recoil• Helps to keep the alveoli dry•Helps to prevent pulmonary edema (Option A)The surface tension generates a pressure that tends to collapse the sphere.In accordance with Law of Laplace - P=2T/r, whereP - Collapsing pressure on alveolus (dynes/cm2) or Pressure required to keep alveolus open(dynes/cm2)T = Surface tension (dynes/cm)r = Radius of the alveolus (cm).Collapsing pressure is inversely related to radius i.e. large alveolus (one with a large radius) willhave a low collapsing pressure and therefore will require only minimal pressure to keep it open.On the other hand, a small alveolus (one with a small radius) will have a high collapsing pressureand require more pressure to keep it open.By reducing surface tension, surfactant reduces the collapsing pressure for a given radius.Option B: Surfactant deficiency is an important cause of infant respiratory distress syndrome(IRDS) also known as hyaline membrane disease, the serious pulmonary disease that develops ininfants born before their surfactant system is functional..In IRDS, there is high surface tension in the lungs resulting in atelectasis• Also, there is retention of fluid in the lungs.• During fetal life, Cl- is secreted with fluid by the pulmonary epithelial cells. At birth, there is ashift to Na+ reabsorption by these cells via ENaC and fluid is absorbed along with Na+. Prolongedimmaturity of ENaC contributes to pulmonary edema in IRDS.Option D: Surfactant increases lung compliance, which reduces the work of expanding the lungsduring inspiration. Increasing the compliance of the lungs reduces the collapsing force at anygiven volume so that it is easier for the lungs to expand.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The mechanism of action of surfactant is by breaking the structure of water in alveoli. When water forms a surface with air, the water molecules on the surface of the alveoli have a strong attraction for one another. This pulls the molecules together, leading to high surface tension. The surfactant is amphipathic in nature (i.e., hydrophobic on one end and hydrophilic on the other). They align themselves on the alveolar surface, with their hydrophobic portions facing the alveolar lumen. The cohesive force between a water molecule and an adjacent pulmonary surfactant molecule is very low. So, they break up the attracting forces between water molecules lining the alveoli (which had been responsible for the high surface tension). Thus, they reduce surface tension.",
