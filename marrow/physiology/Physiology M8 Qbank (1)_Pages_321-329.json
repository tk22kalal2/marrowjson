      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Major reward centres are located along the course of the medial forebrain bundle, especially in the lateral and ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus. Therefore, stimulation of those areas will promote a sense of reward. It is interesting to note that in the lateral nucleus of the hypothalamus, a weak stimulus produces a sense of pleasure whereas a strong stimulus produces rage. This phenomenon occurs in many areas where a weak stimulus produces a sense of reward while stronger ones produce a sense of punishment.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In the hypothalamus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus functions as the principal pacemaker, or timeclock, for circadian rhythms.The pacemaker receives input from the eyes and many other parts of the nervous system, andthese inputs mediate the effects exerted by the external environment (retinohypothalamic tract).One output of the pacemaker goes to the pineal gland, a gland within the brain that secretes thehormone melatonin. These neural signals cause the pineal gland to secrete melatonin duringdarkness but not during daylight.327",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Lesions involving the anterior and preoptic hypothalamic regions cause paradoxicalvasoconstriction, tachycardia, and hyperthermia.The anterior hypothalamus activates mechanisms of cooling the body when the temperatureincreases via the reflex response.Stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus causes cutaneous vasodilation and sweating, therebycooling the body. Lesions in this region cause hyperthermia, with rectal temperatures sometimesreaching 43°C (109.4°F).",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Diurnal variation of ACTH depends on the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The secretory rates of ACTH and cortisol are high in the early morning but low in the late evening. This effect results from a 24-hour cyclical alteration in the signals from the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus that cause cortisol secretion. When a person changes daily sleeping habits, the cycle changes correspondingly.",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Functions of the categorical hemisphere are logical, analytical, sequential thinking, and verbaltasks, such as math, language forms, and philosophy.Human language functions depend more on one cerebral hemisphere than on the other. Thishemisphere is concerned with categorization and symbolization and has often been called thedominant hemisphere. However, the other hemisphere is specialized in the area of spatiotemporalrelations.The concept of \"cerebral dominance\" and a dominant and non-dominant hemisphere has beenreplaced by, one hemisphere for sequential-analytic processes (the categorical hemisphere) andone for visuospatial relations (the representational hemisphere).The representational cerebral hemisphere excels in nonlanguage skills, especially spatialperception, and artistic and musical talents.",

Renin-angiotensin system2. Baroreceptors in heart and blood vessels.The intake of liquids during a meal is known as prandial drinking. The increase is known aslearned or habit response but is not understood completely.The following factors are thought to play a role1. Increase in plasma osmolality due to food absorption2.
