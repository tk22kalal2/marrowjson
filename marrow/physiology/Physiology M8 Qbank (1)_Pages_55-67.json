      "explanation": "When the extracellular concentration of K+ is decreased (hypokalemia), there is increasednegativity of RMP.RMP predominantly depends on the diffusion of K+ from inside to outside the cell. This diffusiondepends on the concentration gradient with the inside of the cell having a larger concentration ofK+ ions. When the extracellular concentration of K+ decreases, the concentration gradient for K+rises. Therefore, more K+ ions diffuse out of the cell. This leaves the inside of the cell morenegative relative to the extracellular space. This increases the negativity of the RMP, leaving themembrane hyperpolarised.",
