      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Phase 0 of pacemaker potential is initiated by opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The pacemaker potential consists of: • Phase 0 - this is the upstroke seen due to the opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. This causes an influx of calcium leading to the upstroke. • Phase 3 - This is followed by inactivation of the calcium channels and simultaneous activation of K+ channels. This leads to efflux of K+, bringing about repolarization. • Phase 4 - As the K+ efflux declines, a channel permeable to both Na+ and K+ opens, leading to an influx of both Na+ and K+. This is the If channel. This is responsible for slow spontaneous diastolic depolarization. This accounts for the automaticity of SA and AV nodes. The slope of Phase 4 in the SA node determines the heart rate. Note: Fast voltage-gated Na+ channels seen in myocyte potential are permanently inactivated because of the less negative resting potential of the pacemaker cells.",

Vagus nerve effects on the heart: Post-ganglionic parasympathetic nerve (vagus nerve) releases acetylcholine (Ach), which activates muscarinic receptors in the SA node, AV node, and atrial muscle, resulting in a reduction of heart rate, reduction of transmission through the AV node, and a reduction in atrial contractility.",
