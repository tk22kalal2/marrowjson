      "explanation": "The acid-base disorder here is a mixed disorder of metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis.It should not be confused with metabolic acidosis with uncompensated respiratory alkalosis. Thiscan be understood by the following calculation:Step 1: The pH in this patient is 7.1 (pH &lt;7.35) which indicates acidosis693Step 2: HCO3- is 12 mmol/L (Normal HCO3- - 22–30 mmol/L). In metabolic acidosis,HCO3- levels decrease.Hence, this is a case of metabolic acidosis.Step 3: As per Winter's formula, the expected respiratory compensation in metabolic acidosis canbe calculated using,pCO2 =( 1.5 x [HCO3-]) +8 ± 2In this case, Expected pCO2 = ( 1.5 × [12]) +8 ± 2= 26 ± 2x= 24 28 mmHg-The pCO2 in this patient is 18 mmHg, which implies there is an overcompensation of pCO2. Thisovercompensation can happen only if there is an additional component of respiratory alkalosiscontributing to reduced pCO2.Hence, this patient has a mixed disorder - metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis.",
