      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Pre-Botzinger complex generates the rhythm for automated breathing. These are also known as pacemaker cells located in the medulla. These are the first set of neurons that initiate inspiration. These neurons discharge rhythmically, and they produce rhythmic discharges in the phrenic motor neurons. Breathing is under the control of both the following: Voluntary control: Located in the cerebral cortex (via corticospinal tract). Automatic control: Driven by pacemaker cells in the medulla (Pre-Botzinger complex). These activate motor neurons via cervical (Phrenic nerve innervating diaphragm) and thoracic spinal cord (external intercostal muscle). There is a reciprocal innervation to expiratory and inspiratory muscles in that motor neurons supplying expiratory muscles are inactive when motor neurons supplying inspiratory muscles are active, and vice versa. Inspiration Initiation: Pre-Botzinger complex (Pacemaker cells) in Medulla. Maintenance: Apneustic center in lower Pons stimulates Dorsal group of neurons in the medulla. Inspiration Termination: Apneustic center is inhibited by Vagus and Pneumotaxic center. Regulation of expiration: During quiet breathing, expiration is a passive process; there is no firing of neurons. Ventral respiratory group of neurons are involved in forceful expiration, like during exercise. Mnemonic DIVE: Dorsal respiratory group for Inspiration and Ventral respiratory group for Expiration.",

      "explanation": "The rate of inspiration is controlled by the pneumotaxic centre. Pneumotaxic centre: Location: Upper pons (dorsally in nucleus parabrachialis) Function: • Transmits signals to the inspiratory area, i.e., it inhibits the apneustic centre and thus the dorsal respiratory group of neurons, to stop inspiration. • It thus helps limit the duration of inspiration and switching between inspiration and expiration. • This has a secondary effect of increasing the rate of breathing because limiting the duration of inspiration also shortens the duration of expiration, and hence, the entire period of respiration.

      "explanation": "Depth of inspiration is increased by the apneustic centre. The apneustic centre sends signals to prevent switching off of inspiration maintained by the dorsal respiratory group of neurons, thereby increasing the depth of inspiration. In contrast to this, the pneumotaxic centre primarily limits inspiration by controlling the 'switch-off' point of the inspiratory ramp signal. A note on inspiratory ramp signal: The neural signals transmitted to the inspiratory muscle, mainly the diaphragm, are not the instantaneous burst of action potentials. Instead, it begins weakly and increases steadily in a ramped manner. The advantage of the ramp is that it causes a steady increase in the volume of the lungs during inspiration, rather than inspiratory gasps. Control of the limiting point at which the ramp suddenly ceases is the mechanism by which the respiratory centres control depth and rate of respiration. Option A: Pneumotaxic centre of the pons regulates the rate and depth of breathing. Option B: Ventral group of neurons regulate expiration. Option C: Dorsal group of neurons regulate inspiration.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The ventral respiratory group contributes to the extra respiratory drive (overdrive mechanism). During quiet breathing: Expiration is a passive process and the neurons from the ventral respiratory group remain almost totally inactive during quiet respiration. Unlike the dorsal respiratory group (DRG; dorsal group of neurons), VRG (the ventral group of neurons) does not appear to participate in the basic rhythmic oscillations that control respiration. Extra-respiratory drive (overdrive mechanism): When the respiratory drive for increased pulmonary ventilation becomes greater than normal, for example, during exercise, respiratory signals spill over to VRG from DRG. So, VRG contributes to the extra respiratory drive (overdrive mechanism). The neurons of VRG contribute to both inspiration and expiration; especially, they are important in providing powerful expiratory signals to the abdominal muscles during very heavy expiration. Dorsal and ventral respiratory group: Location - Function. Dorsal respiratory group - Nucleus Tractus Solitarius in medulla - Inspiratory ramp signals - Stimulates inspiration. Ventral respiratory group - Nucleus Retro Ambigualis in medulla - Inactive during quiet breathing; Active during forced expiration. Medulla - Pons - Ventral respiratory group (VRG).

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The apneustic center is located in the lower pons and it stimulates the inspiratory center to increase inspiratory activity. The apneustic center of the pons sends signals to the DRG in the medulla to delay the 'switch off' signal of the inspiratory ramp provided by the pneumotaxic center of the pons. It gets feedback from vagal afferents and also from other respiratory centers. The apneustic center is inhibited by vagal afferents from pulmonary stretch receptors aroused by inspiration, so that the stimulatory effect on the inspiratory neurons is switched off, allowing expiration to supervene.",

        "D": "Are most important receptors causing an increased ventilation in response to a rise in PCO2"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Peripheral chemoreceptors respond minimally to changes in PO2 under normoxic conditions. Because of the enormous blood flow per unit of tissue to the carotid bodies, the receptors are not stimulated in conditions such as anemia or carbon monoxide poisoning, in which the amount of dissolved O2 in the blood reaching the receptors is generally normal, even though the combined O2 in the blood is markedly decreased. Peripheral chemoreceptors are responsive to changes in arterial O2, CO2, and H+ ions. They are excited by a decrease in arterial O2. However, a graph plotted between the rate of firing of afferent neurons in the chemoreceptor vs. arterial pO2 shows they are most sensitive to changes in pO2 of less than 60mmHg. Thus, ventilation is driven by pCO2 and H+ under normoxic conditions. Other options: Option B: Peripheral chemoreceptors respond to changes in blood pH. They are excited by an increase in H+ ions (i.e., decrease in pH). Option C: The response of peripheral chemoreceptors to changes in PCO2 is faster than that of central chemoreceptors. Increase in arterial pCO2 stimulates respiration. However, the stimulation by way of peripheral chemoreceptors occurs 5 times as rapidly as that from central chemoreceptors. This helps increase the rapidity of response to CO2 at the onset of exercise. Option D: Central chemoreceptors are more important than the peripheral chemoreceptors in the ventilatory response to increased CO2. Note: Most potent stimulus for central chemoreceptor in blood: CO2. Most potent stimulus for central chemoreceptor in CSF: H+ ions. Most potent stimulus for respiration: CO2.",

      "explanation": "Cyanide causes histotoxic hypoxia, and thus, by preventing the O2 utilization at the tissue level, it acts as a powerful stimulus for peripheral chemoreceptors. Even though the Po2 level of blood is normal in the case of cyanide poisoning, the sensors in the carotid and aortic bodies are not able to sense oxygen in the blood because of the blockade of cellular respiration, and hence, they go into a hypoxic state and get stimulated. Option A: Acidosis (increased H+ ions) stimulates peripheral chemoreceptors. Option B: Increased pCO2 mainly stimulates central chemoreceptors. Option C: The peripheral chemoreceptors have an enormous blood flow per unit tissue (2000 mL/100g of tissue/min) because of which the O2 needs of the cells can be met by dissolved O2. Therefore, carbon monoxide poisoning does not stimulate peripheral chemoreceptors because the amount of dissolved O2 is generally normal, even though the combined O2 in the blood is markedly decreased.",

Combined O2 in the blood is markedly decreased. The blood flow per unit tissue of carotid body chemoreceptors is enormous (2000 mL/100g of tissue/min). Hence, O2 needs of the tissue can be met largely by dissolved O2 alone.

Option A: Central chemoreceptors do not respond to pO2 of the blood. Option C: For a given rise in pCO2, the CSF pH falls more than that of the blood because the CSF has less buffering. CO2 combines with H2O to form H2CO3, which dissociates into H+ and HCO3-. H+ is buffered by combining with Hb. This buffering is less in CSF, and hence pH falls. Option D: The HCO3- concentration of the CSF can affect the output of the central chemoreceptors by buffering the changes in pH. HCO3- can combine with H+ and thus neutralize it and alter pH and thus alter output of central chemoreceptors.",

Hypercapnia depresses the central nervous system, including respiratory centers, leading to CO2 narcosis (a headache, confusion, and eventually coma).

This signal inhibits the inspiratory ramp signals of the dorsal respiratory group of neurons (DRG), thus, inspiration is quickly inhibited and expiration follows. Advantages of Hering-Breuer inflation reflex: It cuts down the inspiration time, and therefore, it prevents overinflation of the lungs. Lungs operate at lower lung volumes, thereby preventing wastage of energy. The Hering-Breuer reflex is activated when the lung volume increases to more than three times the normal tidal volume (tidal volume = 0.5 liters/breath; so, lung volume > 1.5 liters per breath activates the reflex). It signifies that the reflex plays a protective role preventing the overinflation of the lung rather than regulating the normal ventilation.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Head's paradoxical reflex is stimulated by hyperinflation of the lungs. It refers to prolonged inspiration stimulating further inspiration. Hyperinflation of the lungs causes a strong and long-lasting inspiratory effort (an effect opposite to the Hering-Breuer inflation reflex). Physiological role: • Occasional deep breaths, which are thought to counteract any tendency to atelectasis in quiet breathing and possibly in reinforcing the gasps or inspiratory efforts. • The first cry after birth. • The possible explanation for this could be the inhibition of the vagus nerve at cold temperatures (due to the presence of pulmonary fluid in the unaerated newborn lungs). • Lack of inhibitory impulses from the pulmonary stretch receptors and vagus has an effect opposite to Hering-Breuer's inflation reflex.",

        "D": "None of the above"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Moderate exercise does not reduce the arterial PO2, increase the arterial PCO2, or reduce the arterial pH. Option A: The brain, upon transmitting motor impulses to the exercising muscles, is believed to transmit collateral impulses into the brainstem at the same time to excite the respiratory center. This action is analogous to the stimulation of the vasomotor center of the brain stem during exercise that causes a simultaneous increase in arterial pressure. Option B: The PO2 of mixed venous blood does fall, but there are no known chemoreceptors that are stimulated as a result. Option C: Two points are important regarding pH during moderate exercise: • pH = pK + log ([HCO3-]/[CO2]) • The pH of the blood is dependent only on the ratio of the amount of CO2 to the amount of HCO3-. The concentrations of both buffer components (HCO3- and CO2) are very large compared to the amount of H+ added to the blood during moderate exercise. Thus, any change in HCO3- due to the addition of H+ during moderate exercise is very tiny compared to the amount of HCO3- already present in the blood. Thus, the pH of blood during moderate exercise remains constant. When sufficient oxygen is not available during exercise, there is increased accumulation of lactic acid, which initially leads to an increase in PaCO2. However, this is counteracted by the stimulation of ventilation and, as a result, PaCO2 is decreased. This provides some respiratory compensation for further lactic acid production and prevents a decline in blood pH. Thus, blood pH remains constant in moderate exercise.",

      "explanation": "The exercise-induced hyperventilation during vigorous exercise is produced due to the receptors present in carotid bodies. When exercise becomes more vigorous, buffering of the increased amounts of lactic acid that are produced liberates more CO2, and this further increases ventilation. The additional increase in ventilation produced by the acidosis depends on the carotid bodies and does not occur if they are removed.

        "D": "Joint proprioceptor stimulation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "In moderate exercise, the respiratory rate is increased at the beginning due to the response of joint proprioceptor stimulation. Respiratory responses to exercise: During exercise, there is an increase in ventilatory rate that matches the increase in O2 consumption and CO2 production by the body. The stimulus for increased ventilation rate is the activation of joint proprioceptors at the beginning of the exercise. The mean values for arterial PO2 and PCO2 do not change during exercise. Arterial pH does not change during moderate exercise, although it may decrease during strenuous exercise because of lactic acidosis. On the other hand, venous PCO2 increases during exercise because the excess CO2 produced by exercising muscle is carried to the lungs in venous blood. Pulmonary blood flow increases because cardiac output increases during exercise. As a result, more pulmonary capillaries are perfused, and more gas exchange occurs. The distribution of V/Q ratios throughout the lung is more even during exercise than when at rest, and there is a resulting decrease in the physiologic dead space. The abrupt increase at the start of exercise is presumably due to psychic stimuli and afferent impulses from proprioceptors in muscles, tendons, and joints. The more gradual increase in ventilation is presumably due to an increase in O2 consumption (proportional increase), an increase in body temperature, and increases in the plasma K+ level (which stimulate the peripheral chemoreceptors). The sensitivity of the neurons controlling the response to CO2 is increased, or the respiratory fluctuations in arterial PCO2 increase, so that, even though the mean arterial PCO2 does not rise, it is CO2 that is responsible for the increase in ventilation.",

The pneumotaxic center: it is located dorsally in the nucleus parabrachialis of the upper pons and it transmits signals to the inspiratory area. The primary effect of this center is to control the switch-off point of the inspiratory ramp, thus controlling the duration of the filling phase of the lung cycle. The function of the pneumotaxic center is primarily to limit inspiration, which has a secondary effect of increasing the rate of breathing, because limitation of inspiration also shortens expiration and the entire period of each respiration.",
