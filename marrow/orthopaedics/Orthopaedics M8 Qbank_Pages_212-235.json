      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The given patient has a burst fracture of L4 vertebra.The given lateral view CT image shows that the L4 vertebra has exploded. The posterior border ofL4 has lost its concavity and has become convex. There is posterior displacement of the bone intothe spinal canal. This is diagnostic of burst fracture of the L4 vertebra with retropulsion.232Burst fracture results from severe axial compression that explodes the vertebral body.Radiological findings:• AP view X-rays: Spreading of the vertebral body with an increase of the interpedicular distancemay be seen.•Lateral view X-rays: Posterior displacement of bone into the spinal canal (retropulsion) can beseen at the posterosuperior border of the vertebral body. The normal concavity of the posteriorvertebral body becomes convex in retropulsion.Management of burst fractures:• Stable burst fracture:• Minimal anterior wedging and posterior ligament complex intact• No neurological deficits.• Conservatively managed with bed rest until acute symptoms settle, followed by a thoracolumbarbrace (TLSO) or body cast for about 12 weeks• Unstable burst fracture:• Cases of neurological injury•⚫ Disruption of the posterior ligamentous complex (PLC)• More than 50% canal compromise on CT••Operative management donePosterior pedicle screw fixation is the standard treatment for PLC disruption",

        "D": "Associated abdominal injuries are seen in 50% of these injuries"
      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The X-ray image shows a Chance fracture, which is by definition unstable as it can involve middleand posterior columns.Chance fracture is also known as seat-belt injury or the jack-knife injury. This injury is typicallylocated in the upper lumbar spine in people involved in motor vehicle collisions while wearing alap seat-belt without a shoulder harness. The sudden deceleration causes flexion and posteriordistraction of the spine. This causes the mid-lumbar spine to bend like a jack-knife around an axisanterior to the vertebral column.There is a tear in the vertebra that passes transversely through the bones (bony Chance fracture),or the ligamentous structures (soft Chance fracture), or both. There is little or no crushing of thevertebral body. However, it is an unstable injury as the posterior and middle columns aredistracted. Neurological damage is uncommon. Associated intra-abdominal injuries are seen in50% of these injuries.233Chance FractureMEOMARROWNX-rays may show a horizontal fracture with the split running through the vertebra. It may involvethe spinous process, the transverse processes, pedicles and the vertebral body. There may beopening up of the disc space posteriorly.Most Chance fractures can be managed conservatively with bed rest and bracing. If posteriorfixation is done, it will allow early mobilization. Ligamentous Chance fractures require posteriorinstrumented fusion.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Vertebroplasty is a procedure of injecting liquid bone cement into the vertebral body.In vertebroplasty, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is injected percutaneously into the vertebrathrough the pedicle to maintain the vertebral height. In kyphoplasty, a balloon is used to expand acompression fracture to regain height before the PMMA is injected.Indications for these 2 minimally invasive procedures include:• Pathological vertebral body fractures caused due to osteoporosis, metastatic carcinoma, ormultiple myeloma.• In some cases of stable compression fractures with no neurological deficits, to manage persistentpain due to the collapse.•Kyphoplasty has been used to correct sagittal deformity and prevent kyphosisRisks of these procedures include the possibility of disruption of the posterior cortex and cementmaterial leaking out into the spinal canal and causing neurological deficits. Therefore, theseprocedures must be done after careful consideration.The below plain X-ray shows the spine of a person who has undergone vertebroplasty.234Vertebroplasty235",
