      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The correct match is: Most fractures occur due to a combination of forces, but the dominant mechanism of force is revealed by the type of fracture. Type of fracture: Mechanism of force: Transverse fracture: Tension. Oblique fracture: Compression. Butterfly fragment: Bending. Spiral fracture: Twisting. Pattern A Fracture: Spiral fracture. Trauma. Based on the continuity of the periosteum, fractures can be complete or incomplete. In complete fractures, the bone is split into two or more fragments and continuity of periosteum is disrupted. It can be: 1. Impacted fracture - The fracture fragments are jammed together and the fracture line is not visible. 2. Comminuted fracture - There is a fracture of more than two fragments. 3. Segmental fracture - A separated fragment is seen in the middle. 4. Avulsion fracture - Breaking of a piece of bone attached to a strong muscle, e.g., olecranon and patella fracture. In incomplete fractures, the bone is incompletely split and the periosteum remains in continuity. They include: 1. Greenstick fractures: The outer cortex breaks and the inner cortex bends, causing the bone to buckle like the snapping of a green twig. It is seen in the pediatric population. 2. Compression fractures: Cancellous bone crumples due to force. This is typically seen in vertebral bodies, calcaneum, and the tibial plateau.",

      "question": "An elderly woman was brought to the OPD after she slipped and fell from her chair. She is a known case of breast cancer with distant metastasis. The X-ray of the patient is given below. Which of the following statements is false regarding this type of fracture?",
      "options": {
        "A": "It occurs in abnormal bones",

        "D": "Pain occurs only after the fracture"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with a history of trivial trauma, breast cancer, and the X-ray findings are suggestive of a pathological fracture due to bone metastasis. Pain in the case of a pathological fracture usually precedes the fracture. Fractures occur due to: Trauma, Repetitive stress (stress or fatigue fracture), or Abnormal weakening of the bone (pathological fracture). Pathological fractures are fractures that occur in a weakened bone that has structurally changed due to some condition. They occur either spontaneously or due to minor trauma. The features suggestive of a pathological fracture include: Pain at the site before the fracture, Multiple recent fractures, Elderly patient, History of primary malignancy, or Unusual fracture pattern (Banana fracture - transverse fracture through an abnormal area of bone, similar to breaking a segment from a banana). FDG-PET or CT is the gold standard in evaluating bony metastases. The risk of fracture in metastatic bone lesions is assessed using Mirels' score. A Mirels' score > 8 warrants a prophylactic fixation. Management of pathological fracture is based on the causative lesion and survival of the patient.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Fabry's disease does not cause pathological fractures. It presents with angiokeratomas and acroparesthesias. Pathological fractures are fractures that occur in a weakened bone that has structurally changed due to some condition. They occur either spontaneously or due to minor trauma. In Gaucher's disease, there is a deficiency of glucocerebrosidase. This leads to an accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages in the bone tissue, weakening the bone and causing fractures. Osteogenesis imperfecta is an autosomal dominant disorder that occurs most commonly due to a mutation in the COL1A and COL2A genes. This results in the abnormal formation of type 1 collagen. Since type 1 collagen is mainly present in the bone, the patient presents with repeated fractures with no or minimal trauma. Hyperparathyroidism can cause severe bone resorption leading to bone pains and pathological fracture. Overall, osteoporosis is the most common reason for pathological fractures. Below the age of 20, the common causes of pathological fracture are benign bone tumors and cysts.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Pathological fracture",

        "C": "Runner's fracture",
        "D": "Green stick fracture"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and the X-ray showing a fracture of the 2nd metatarsal are suggestive of a March fracture. It is a type of stress fracture. Stress fractures (or fatigue fractures) occur in a normal bone that is subjected to chronic repetitive stress. This initiates a bone remodeling process. When resorption occurs faster than replacement, the bone becomes liable to fracture. Such fractures are typically seen in athletes, dancers, or military personnel who have a strenuous exercise regimen. Common sites for stress fractures include: • Metatarsals (especially the second, march fracture) • Calcaneum • Navicular • Distal shaft of the fibula (runner's fracture) • Tibial shaft • Patella • Femoral neck. MRI is the investigation of choice to diagnose stress fractures. It can visualize lower-grade stress injuries before X-ray changes appear. A bone scan is the investigation of choice when multiple sites have stress fractures. Most stress fractures are managed using an elastic bandage and avoidance of painful activity until the lesion heals. Stress fracture of the femoral neck should be managed by internal fixation as a prophylactic measure.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Increased callus formation is seen with flexibly fixed fractures. Fracture heals through direct union (primary bone healing) or callus formation (secondary bone healing). Direct union: This occurs when the fracture site is absolutely stable. This is seen in a fracture held by a metal plate with absolute stability and in cases of impacted fracture in cancellous bones. There is no stimulus for callus formation. Osteoblastic new bone formation occurs directly between the fracture fragments. Callus formation: This occurs when the fracture is not fixed rigidly. The healing proceeds through 5 stages: Hematoma formation, Inflammation, Soft callus formation, Hard callus formation, and Remodeling. Healing by callus ensures mechanical strength as the movement and stress make the callus grow stronger. Normal bone, Hematoma and Cartilaginous, Bony callus and inflammation. The image below shows callus formation: callus, cartilaginous remnants, Hard Remodeling.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The technique which uses traction on the soft tissue around the bones to reduce the fracture fragments is known as ligamentotaxis. The given X-ray shows a fracture of the radial styloid process (Chauffeur's fracture or Hutchinson fracture). Reduction of the fracture is done to ensure normal alignment and adequate apposition of the bone fragments. There are two methods of reduction: \n   • Closed reduction: The fracture is reduced under appropriate anesthesia and muscle relaxation. Closed reduction of fracture relies on indirect fragment alignment utilizing the pull of the soft tissue envelope (ligaments and capsules), which is known as ligamentotaxis. \n   • Open reduction: Operative reduction of the fracture under direct vision. \n   Option A and C: Callotaxis is callus distraction or distraction osteogenesis. It is used for limb lengthening or filling of large segmental defects in the bone. \n   Option D: Arthrodesis (artificial ankylosis or syndesis) is the artificial induction of joint ossification between two bones by surgery.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "A hanging cast is used to treat the fractured shaft of the humerus. Humerus shaft fracture heals readily with just the external cast as it is usually enough to bring the fragments into alignment. The arm is placed over the lower chest with the elbow at 90°. A collar and cuff support can be used to maintain the position. The weight of the arm provides continuous traction to the humerus (traction by gravity). After the fracture is reduced, it is important to hold the reduction with some restriction of movements to promote soft-tissue healing and to allow free movement of the unaffected parts. The methods of holding reduction include: continuous traction (traction by gravity, skin traction, or skeletal traction), cast splintage, functional bracing, internal fixation, and external fixation.",

      "explanation": "The cast applied to a patient in the glass holding position is known as the scaphoid cast. It is used to treat scaphoid fractures. To apply a scaphoid cast, the wrist is held in slight dorsiflexion and the thumb is in abduction and slight flexion as if the glass is being held between the index finger and thumb. It extends from just below the elbow to just proximal to the metacarpal necks of the digits. On the thumb, the cast extends just proximal to the interphalangeal joint. Scaphoid fracture presents with pain and swelling over the radial aspect of the wrist. A fall on an outstretched hand could result in such a fracture. The fracture can be confirmed (when an x-ray does not show a fracture) if there is pain elicited in the anatomical snuff box on the radial border of the wrist. An oblique x-ray of the wrist should be able to show a scaphoid fracture.",

      "explanation": "This open fracture will be classified as Type IIIB on Gustilo-Anderson's classification due to the extensive wound (>10 cm), high contamination, very severe loss of soft tissue cover, and intact vascularity. A fracture where the skin and soft tissues are breached is known as an open fracture (or a compound fracture).

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "When there is impaired nerve supply, primary closure of an open fracture is not recommended. Primary closure of an open fracture is the closure of the wound by direct skin suturing during the index procedure (first debridement). In general, primary closure of wounds of Gustilo type I and II fractures can be done at the time of debridement. In Gustilo type IIIA fractures, some surgeons delay closure until a second-look procedure is performed. In most cases of Gustilo type IIIB and IIIC injuries, a delayed closure is practiced. Important criteria for primary closure: • The patient's general condition should be stable. • Injury to debridement interval is < 12 hours. • All necrotic material must have been removed. • Stable fixation can be achieved either by internal or external fixation. • Normal circulation. • Intact nerve supply. • The wound skin margins can be closed without tension. • There should be no multisystem injuries.",

External fixation is holding the fracture using transfixing screws that pass through the bone above and below the fracture and are connected to each other by rigid bars or an external frame. This provides rigid fixation of the bones in cases where other methods of immobilization are inappropriate. External fixation is especially applicable for the tibia and pelvis. It is also used for fractures of the femur, humerus, and distal radius. Common indications for external fixation: • Severe type II and III open fractures • Fractures associated with severe burns (as burn tissue predisposes to infection and can result in osteomyelitis) • Fractures requiring grafts • Fractures requiring distraction • Limb lengthening (Ilizarov Procedure) • Arthrodesis • Infected fractures or nonunions • Correction of malunions",

      "explanation": "The given image shows distraction osteogenesis using the Ilizarov apparatus. Osteomyelitis is not a contraindication for this procedure. Distraction osteogenesis (distraction histogenesis) is the mechanical induction of new bone that occurs between bony surfaces that are gradually pulled apart. This is described as the tension-stress effect. The most important application of the tension-stress principle is known as callus distraction (or callotaxis). A careful fracture of the bone is performed, followed by a short wait. The young callus formed is gradually distracted using a circular or unilateral external fixator. This is used in limb lengthening or for the filling of large segmental defects in the bone. Distraction or compression is carried out at the rate of 1 mm per day. This is done in four sittings - 0.25 mm, four times a day. It is also used in the following scenarios: Non-union, Deformity correction, Osteomyelitis - as it offers the possibility of liberal excision of bone, and Arthrodesis - crushing articular surfaces can stimulate union between opposing bones.",

Damage Control Orthopaedics (DCO) in unstable/borderline polytrauma patients involves 3 components: Stage 1: Resuscitative procedures for rapid hemorrhage control; Stage 2: Restoration of normal physiologic parameters; Stage 3: Definitive surgical management. The first stage is early temporary stabilization of unstable fractures and the control of the bleeding. In femur fracture, the most suited approach is temporary stabilization using an external fixator. The second stage involves resuscitation and stabilization of the patients in the ICU. Finally, the third stage involves delayed definitive fracture management after the patient's condition becomes suitable. In femur fracture, the definitive procedure is intramedullary nailing, which is performed after the patient becomes stable.",
