      "explanation": "Raised parathormone level and raised alkaline phosphatase along with low serum calcium and lowserum phosphate level is suggestive of rickets.Nutritional rickets occurs due to deficiency of vitamin D. This leads to low calcium levels in theblood. To raise the serum calcium, the secretion of the parathyroid hormone rises. Theparathyroid hormone tries to raise the calcium levels by :358• Reabsorbing calcium in the kidneys and secreting phosphate in exchange leading to lowphosphate levels• Increasing bone resorption",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and the image showing scorbutic rosary are suggestive of scurvy.Scurvy results from the deficiency of vitamin C. Vitamin C is required for the hydroxylation oflysine and proline that are used in the synthesis of collagen. Hence, deficiency of vitamin C leadsto the formation of defective collagen.Defective collagen results in capillary hemorrhages which may present as generalized bleedingtendency. It also results in defective osteoid formation. Subperiosteal hemorrhages cause acutepain and swelling mimicking acute osteomyelitis.Costo-chondral separation leads to the formation of tender nodules, also known as scorbuticrosary. Rickets also presents with similar nodules at the costochondral junctions known asrachitic rosary. They can be differentiated as scorbutic rosary is more sharply angulated and arepainful.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of the infantile form of osteopetrosis. It is characterisedby decreased osteoclastic activity due to defect in carbonic anhydrase ll proton pump.The excessive new bone formation with defective resorption leads to abnormal development of theskull, especially causing narrowing of the foramina of the skull. This leads to variouscomplications like hydrocephalus, cranial nerve compression leading to deafness and facial palsy,sinus blockage, etc.Failure of bone resorption results in poorly formed medullary cavity. This leads to defectivehematopoiesis in the medullary cavity and stimulation of extramedullary hematopoiesis. Hence,the infant presents with pancytopenia and hepatosplenomegaly.Abnormal bone density may also lead to altered vasculature causing complications like osteitis ofthe mandible.Excess bone density also leads to endobone appearance and rugger jersey appearance of vertebraeon radiograph. X-ray spine of a patient with osteopetrosis is given below.Renal osteodystrophy also shows rugger jersey appearance of vertebrae on x-ray. However, renalosteodystrophy is a complication of chronic kidney disease and the patient is an infant. So thelikely answer in the patient in the given scenario is osteopetrosis (Option B).362DAILYROUNDS363",
