The degree of curvature of scoliosis on plain radiographs is measuredusing Cobb's angle.To measure the Cobbs's angle, first locate the superior-end vertebra and inferior-end vertebra ofthe curve. Then draw perpendicular lines to the superior surface of the superior-end vertebra andto the inferior surface of the inferior-end vertebra.The angle formed at the intersection of these perpendiculars is the angle of the spinal curveknown as Cobb's angle.

      "explanation": "Risser's sign evaluates skeletal maturation using the ossification of the iliac apophysis.Risser's sign is used to predict the worsening of scoliosis and in the planning of corrective surgery.The iliac apophysis is divided into four quadrants. The ossification of iliac apophyses normallyproceeds from lateral to the medial side i.e., from the anterior superior iliac spine to the posteriorsuperior iliac spine.245The Risser sign progresses from grade o (no ossification) to grade 4 (all four quadrants haveossified). When the apophysis has fused completely with the ilium, it is Risser grade 5 and thepatient is considered skeletally mature.Risser's grade 5 (fusion with the ilium) coincides with the fusion of the apophysis in the vertebralring. After this, there is no possibility of further progression of the scoliosis curve.2Risser's SignComplete fusionwith ilium34Risser gradeDescriptionGrade 1Grade 2Grade 3Grade 4Grade 5ossification of lateral 25%ossification of lateral 50%ossification of lateral 75%ossification of lateral 100%fusion with the iliumOMARROW5",
