      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Dashboard injury can lead to: • Posterior hip dislocation • Patellar fracture • Fracture of the neck of the femur • Acetabular fracture • Shaft of femur fracture • Posterior cruciate ligament injury. Dashboard injury occurs when the knee is flexed and the hip of the driver/passenger thrusts forward against the dashboard of the car in road traffic accidents. Posterior dislocation is most common in this type of injury. Dashboard injury in a flexed knee in neutral adduction causes simple posterior dislocation. Whereas, if there is slight abduction, posterior fracture-dislocation occurs.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of posterior hip dislocation. In this condition, the leg will be in flexion, adduction, and internal rotation. The femoral artery pulsation is usually felt against the neck of the femur. Due to the posterior dislocation of the hip joint, the femoral vessels fall backwards and the pulsation of the femoral artery cannot be felt. This is called the vascular sign of Narath.",

      "question": "A 40-year-old patient presents to the emergency department following a road traffic accident. The radiograph of his pelvis is shown below. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Central dislocation of the hip",

        "C": "Posterior dislocation of the hip",
        "D": "Anterior dislocation of the hip"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The radiograph of the patient's pelvis following a road traffic accident reveals upward and lateral dislocation of the left femoral head, accompanied by an obscured lesser trochanter, indicating a posterior dislocation of the left hip. Posterior hip dislocation is commonly seen following dashboard injuries, and the patient presents with flexion, adduction, and internal rotation deformity of the lower limb. Radiological findings: • Loss of continuity of acetabulum with the femoral head (break in Shenton's line). • Upward and lateral displacement of the femoral head. • The femoral head appears smaller than normal. • The lesser trochanter is not visualized as the thigh is internally rotated. • Femoral head and posterior acetabular wall fractures may also be seen. The image below shows posterior dislocation with disruption of Shenton's line: Normal Shenton line, Disruption of Shenton line. Treatment: An early reduction should be done as the risk of osteonecrosis and subsequent osteoarthritis increases with time. Closed reduction under sedation or general anesthesia is done in most cases. If there is an associated femoral neck fracture, a closed reduction should not be attempted as it can lead to the displacement of the femoral neck and disrupt the blood supply to the femoral head. In closed reduction, the following steps are done: The pelvis is kept in a steady position and traction is applied in line of the femur with the knee flexed at 90 degrees. The hip is then flexed, maintaining the traction along with internal rotation and adduction. This is called Allis' maneuver. Other methods of closed reduction include Stimson's maneuver, East Baltimore lift maneuver, and Bigelow's maneuver. After reduction, the stability of the hip is tested by flexing the hip to 90 degrees, and a longitudinal and posteriorly directed force is applied. While performing this, the joint is monitored in an image intensifier to look for any signs of subluxation. In case of evidence of subluxation or any significant fractures, then surgical repair should be done. If there is a delay in surgical correction, skeletal traction with a distal femoral traction pin can be done. If there is damage to the acetabulum, or intervening structures between the femoral head and the acetabular surface are present, open reduction can be considered. Early complications: • Sciatic nerve injury - It can be damaged in 10-20% of the cases. • Vascular injury - Superior gluteal artery tear can occur. Concurrent femoral shaft fracture - When both occur together, hip dislocation may be missed. Late complications: • Osteonecrosis of the femoral head. • Myositis ossificans. • Secondary osteoarthritis. • Recurrent instability.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "In posterior dislocation of the hip, the lesser trochanter is not visualized in the radiograph. This is due to the internal rotation of the limb. In posterior dislocation of the hip, there is disruption of Shenton's line. It is an imaginary curved line drawn along the inferior border of the superior pubic ramus and along the inferomedial border of the neck of the femur. This line is continuous and smooth. It is usually disrupted in: dislocation of the hip, fracture neck of femur, and developmental dysplasia of the hip.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Kocher's maneuver is used for the management of shoulder dislocation. Reduction of hip dislocation (closed or open) should ideally be performed within 6 hours to prevent osteonecrosis of the hip joint. Methods of closed reduction for posterior hip dislocation are: 1. Allis maneuver - traction applied opposite to the direction of deformity. Allis: Stabilize the hip. Apply traction to leg, internal rotation of hip. Slowly increase leg traction and hip to 90 degrees. 2. Stimson maneuver - downward pressure to the flexed knee (patient is prone and at the edge of the table). 3. Bigelow maneuver - longitudinal traction with pressure on ASIS to stabilize the pelvis. 4. East Baltimore lift maneuver - anterior force on the flexed knee (doctor's and assistant's place hands below the flexed knee).",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of anterior dislocation of the hip as there is the lengthening of the limb. In this condition, the femoral head appears larger than the unaffected side on the X-ray. In the inferior type of anterior dislocation, the femoral head is felt in the groin. Radiographical features include: • Femoral head appears larger than the unaffected side. • Femoral head may be seen inferior to the acetabulum • Lesser trochanter is prominent. Complications of anterior dislocation include: • Injury to femoral vessels • Injury to femoral nerve. Irreducibility • Post-traumatic osteoarthritis • Aseptic necrosis • Recurrent dislocation. Methods of reduction include: • Stimson's gravity method • Allis' manoeuvre • Reverse Bigelow's manoeuvre. The image given below shows anterior hip dislocation. The limb is abducted and the femoral head is displaced inferiorly. Treatment of anterior dislocation includes a closed reduction under sedation or general anesthesia. If closed reduction fails, an open procedure may be planned.",

      "explanation": "External rotation of hip is being tested in the given image. Rotatory movements of the hip joint can be measured with the knee flexed or extended. However, more precise measurements are obtained when the rotation is tested with the flexed knee. The procedure involves the following steps. The patient is made to lie supine. The examiner holds the knee with one hand and ankle with the other hand. The knee and hip are flexed to 90 degrees. Rotation movement is produced at the hip joint by stabilizing the knee and moving the leg as the lever. If the hip is rotated such that the leg moves medially, external rotation of the hip occurs. If the hip is rotated such that the leg moves laterally, internal rotation of the hip occurs.",

      "explanation": "The test being performed by the examiner is Hoover's test. This test is useful in differentiating between the organic and functional causes of limb weakness. Hoover's test involves the following steps: \n      • The examiner places both their hands under the heels of the patient.\n      • The patient is asked to flex the affected hip while keeping the knee extended.\n      Downward pressure in the healthy limb is felt by the examiner in an organic cause of limb weakness and in healthy individuals. This pressure is not felt in the functional cause of limb weakness and malingering.\n      In a normal individual, when raising one leg by flexing at the hip, the other limb exerts a downward pressure which can be felt at the ankle.\n      Hoover's Test \n      The McBride test, Waddell's test, and O'Donoghue's test are other examination techniques that help in distinguishing between organic and non-organic causes of lower back pain.",
