      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "305In cases of spinal tuberculosis, the paradiscal area (marked '2' in the image) of the vertebra ismost commonly involved.The probable reason for this is the rich blood supply of this area which favors the high oxygenrequirement of the tuberculosis bacilli.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Spinal tuberculosis leads to loss of lumbar lordosis.Spinal TB more often causes compression fracture of the anterior part of the vertebrae. This leadsto anterior wedging of the vertebrae giving rise to kyphosis.When spinal TB involves the thoracic vertebrae, it exaggerates the existing thoracic kyphosis.Clinical features of spinal tuberculosis:• Back pain and stiffness are the usual early complaints•Cautious gait - a person with spinal TB will walk carefully with short steps to avoid pain resultingfrom movement• Decreased flexion and extension - all the movements of the vertebral column are decreased inspinal TB due to the associated paraspinal muscle spasm, pain, and skeletal deformityKyphosis in spinal tuberculosisCompression fractureof anterior part ofvertebraeMARRAnterior wedging.of vertebraMARROWKyphoticdeformity",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The reduction of disc space between the vertebrae is an early radiographic finding in spinaltuberculosis. This indicates the destruction of the intervertebral disc due to spinal tuberculosis.The infection first involves the vertebral bodies and the intervertebral disc. Hence, the earlyradiographic features include rarefaction/osteopenic appearance of the involved vertebrae andreduction of disc space between the vertebrae.308In later stages, the infection leads to para-vertebral abscess formation and vertebral destruction.These features can be seen on a radiograph as bird's nest abscess and anterior wedging ofvertebrae respectively.When the disease is in the healing phase, the sclerotic appearance of vertebrae can be seen.",

      "explanation": "The above scenario is suggestive of late-onset paraplegia in spinal tuberculosis. It is because ofvertebral collapse which causes injury to the spinal cord.Spinal tuberculosis with neurological involvement is known as Pott's paraplegia. It is classified asearly-onset and late-onset paraplegia:•Early-onset paraplegia occurs within 2 years of disease onset. It is due to edema, abscess, orgranulation tissue that causes spinal cord compression• Late-onset paraplegia in spinal tuberculosis is because of vertebral collapse which causes injuryto the spinal cord.Prognosis is better in early-onset paresis because it can subside when the active infection istreated or when the drainage of the abscess relieves compression of the cord.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The above scenario is suggestive of tuberculosis of the hip. An apparent shortening of the limb isseen in the stage of early arthritis.Clinical features seen in the four stages of TB hip:• Stage of synovitis presents with apparent lengthening of the limb due to abduction deformity.•Stage of early arthritis presents with apparent shortening of the limb due to adductiondeformity.• Stage of advanced arthritis leads to true shortening of the limb because of the destruction of thearticular cartilage of the femur and the acetabulum.•Stage of arthritis with subluxation leads to true shortening of the limb. The destruction ofacetabulum leads to dislocation of the femur head. This is also known as wandering acetabulum/mortar and pestle hip because of the widened acetabulum and diminished size of femur head.The TB of the hip finally results in fibrous ankylosis of the hip joint.Note: The apparent length of the lower limb is measured from the umbilicus to the medialmalleolus and the true length of the limb is measured from the anterior superior iliac spine to the310medial malleolus. The apparent length is increased when there is abduction deformity of the hipand decreased when there is adduction deformity of the hip.",

Later stages need surgical management.Surgeries for TB hip include:Synovectomy and joint debridement is the preferred surgery in early arthritis.• Girdlestone arthroplasty refers to the modification of the articular surface of the joint. It involvesexcision of the affected portion of the joint and reconstruction of the joint with vastus lateralismuscle. It gives a painless, mobile joint but it results in an unstable hip.•Arthrodesis refers to the fusion of the joint. It is indicated in painful fibrous ankylosis.

Itoccurs due to the spasm of biceps femoris.Tuberculosis of the knee presents with triple deformity, which includes:• Posterior (and lateral) subluxation - due to ligament laxity/ degenerationExternal/lateral rotation - due to spasm of biceps femoris••• Flexion - due to spasm of the hamstrings (semimembranosus, semitendinosus, biceps femoris)Sartorius, gracilis, and popliteus are responsible for medial rotation at the knee joint and do notcontribute to triple deformity.",

This refers to the tuberculosis of short tubularbones i.e. metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanges.The infection is lodged in the marrow cavity leading to spindle-shaped expansion/ ballooned-outappearance of the bone known as spina ventosa. Periosteal reaction, abscess, and sinus formationare seen.TB sicca or caries sicca is the tuberculosis of the shoulder joint. It usually does not have anyeffusion of joint, hence it is known as sicca which is a Latin word for 'dry'.311The image below shows tuberculous dactylitis.
