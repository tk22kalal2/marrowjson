      "explanation": "Zoledronate is bisphosphonate that is administered once a year.The drugs used in the treatment of osteoporosis which decrease bone resorption includebisphosphonates, denosumab, and SERMS (selective estrogen receptor modulators).372Bisphosphonates decrease bone resorption by impairing osteoclast function. The bisphosphonatesapproved for the treatment of osteoporosis are alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, andzoledronate.•Alendronate and risedronate can be administered daily or weekly with different dosages.• Ibandronate can be administered daily, weekly or quarterly.• Zoledronate is administered annually.Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody with an affinity for RANKL. RANKL stimulates osteoclastthat results in bone resorption. By inhibiting the RANKL, denosumab prevents activation ofosteoclast and decreases bone resorption.SERMS: Raloxifene and tamoxifen are approved for the treatment of osteoporosis. Estrogendecreases bone resorption. Thus decrease in estrogen in postmenopausal females results inincreased bone resorption leading to osteoporosis.",

In low andintermittent doses, it leads to bone formation.In high and continuous doses, it leads to boneresorption.Option B: Romosozumab is an anti- sclerostin antibody. Sclerostin inhibition increases boneformation and, to a lesser extent, decreases bone resorption.Option C: Cinacalcet inhibits the parathyroid hormone secretion by activating the calcium-sensingreceptors (CaSR).Option D: Salcatonin inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption.

The commonly associated fractures are fractures of the distal part of the radius (Colle'sfracture), fractures of the hip, and fractures of the vertebrae. In severe cases, the fracture ofvertebrae can cause kyphosis.Radiological findings:• A decreased vertical height of the vertebra due to collapse• Ground glass appearance - especially in bones like pelvis•Codfish appearance - it occurs due to bulging of the disc into the adjacent vertebral bodies sothat it becomes biconcave.DEXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) is the investigation of choice for the diagnosis ofosteoporosis.
