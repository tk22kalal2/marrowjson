        "D": "Pull of the pectoralis muscle"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The lateral fragment in a clavicle fracture is displaced inferiorly due to the force of gravity acting on the ipsilateral arm. The medial fragment is held up by the action of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. (Note: Both the pectoralis muscle and the weight of the arm are responsible, but since the weight of the arm is superior to the muscle bulk and even as per standard reference, we would go with the rational explanation.) Displacing forces in fracture clavicle: Trapezius, weight of arm.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Non-union is a relatively rare complication in clavicle shaft fracture. Malunion is the most common complication in clavicle fractures. The most common bone to be fractured is the clavicle. It is also the most common bone to be fractured during birth. Neurological deficit is rare in clavicular shaft fractures. Undisplaced fractures are treated with a sling or figure of eight bandages for 2-3 weeks. This is followed by mobilization of the limb as the pain subsides. Displaced fractures are treated with internal fixation either by contoured locking plates or intramedullary nails.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Velpeau bandage is not used in glenoid fossa fractures as they require surgical fixation because they are intra-articular. Velpeau bandaging is done by keeping the patient's elbow flexed and the forearm placed against the chest. A sling is then applied to support the weight of the arm. Several layers of restrictive bandages are then applied around the arm and the torso. Velpeau bandage is commonly used for: Acromioclavicular dislocations, humeral shaft fractures, and after open reduction of posterior shoulder dislocation. Acromioclavicular joint injuries are usually seen with direct injury to the lateral shoulder. They are also seen after a fall on an outstretched arm with the elbow locked in extension. They are classified into six types using the Rockwood classification. Type 1-3 is managed conservatively using the Velpeau bandage. Type 4-6 is treated by open reduction and internal fixation.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The inferior glenohumeral ligament is the most important in maintaining shoulder joint stability. It is the main stabilizer when the shoulder is abducted and in extreme ranges of motion. The shoulder joint is anatomically unstable. Only 25% of the humeral head articulates with the glenoid. The joint is reinforced by: Static stabilizers (three capsular thickenings or ligaments): Superior glenohumeral ligament (SGHL), Middle glenohumeral ligament (MGHL), and Inferior glenohumeral ligament (IGHL). Dynamic stabilizers (rotator cuff muscles): Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, Teres minor, and Subscapularis. The long head of biceps also plays a role in shoulder joint stability.",

        "D": "It can also be caused by a fall on the hand"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "This radiograph shows anterior dislocation of the shoulder. The nerve commonly injured in anterior dislocation is the axillary nerve, not the radial nerve. The radiograph shows the disturbed articulation between the humeral head and glenoid fossa. The humeral head is seen below and medial to the glenoid socket. This suggests anterior dislocation of the shoulder joint. Common causes for anterior dislocation include: young adults' athletic injuries and elderly falls. Bankart lesion is a tear in the anteroinferior part of the glenoid labrum caused by the head of the humerus during anterior dislocation. Hill-Sachs lesion is a compression fracture on the posterolateral aspect of the humeral head, caused by the pressure of the anterior glenoid rim on the humeral head in recurrent dislocations.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The bony Bankart lesion is a small, avulsion fracture of the glenoid rim. During an anterior shoulder dislocation, the head of the humerus can tear the antero-inferior part of the glenoid labrum. This is known as a Bankart lesion. In some cases, a small fragment of bone from the glenoid rim can also get avulsed. This is known as a bony Bankart lesion. Avulsion of posterior capsular periosteum is seen in a reverse Bankart lesion. Bony Bankart lesions",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The history and clinical features are suggestive of posterior dislocation of the shoulder. Posterior dislocation of the shoulder usually occurs with an indirect force causing marked internal rotation and adduction. This condition can be seen after a convulsion, or an electric shock. It can also occur after a fall on the flexed and adducted arm, or after a direct blow to the front of the shoulder. The classical attitude of the arm is internal rotation and locked in that position. The examiner will be unable to externally rotate the arm back to the normal position.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "In the above clinical scenario, the history and radiograph suggest an inferior dislocation of the shoulder, which is also known as luxatio erecta. Inferior dislocation is rare and occurs when the arm is forcefully pulled up when in full abduction (hyper-abduction force). The head of the humerus gets forced out of the inferior part of the capsule and comes to lie below the glenoid. The patient will present with the arm locked in abduction. On examination, the humeral head may be felt in or below the axilla. The X-ray below shows disturbed articulation between the humeral head and glenoid. The humeral head is seen below the glenoid. The humerus shaft is in the abducted position. This is characteristic of luxatio erecta.",
