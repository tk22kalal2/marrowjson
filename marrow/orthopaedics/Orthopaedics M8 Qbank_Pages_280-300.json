It is also themost common site of infection.The infection reaches metaphysis via the hematogenous route. The metaphysis is susceptible dueto the following factors:●Hairpin loop arrangement of terminal blood vessels - leads to vascular stasis that favors bacterialcolonization• Fewer phagocytes in this areaApart from the hematogenous route, acute osteomyelitis can also occur by the exogenous route.This includes open fractures, iatrogenic intervention, or spread from local infection.Epiphysealarteryand veinNutrient-arteryand veinNutrientforamenMetaphysealartery and veinMetaphysisBlood supply of boneArticularcartilageMetaphysealarteryand veinPeriosteumCompactboneMedullary cavityEpiphyseallineSolution to Question 2:The given clinical scenario is suggestive of acute osteomyelitis. The most common organismcausing osteomyelitis is Staphylococcus aureus.288The other common causative organisms include:• Pseudomonas aeruginosa - most common cause in IV drug abusers•Salmonella - patients with sickle cell anemia are proneHaemophilus influenzae - was a common causative organism in children, less common now dueto vaccination• Streptococcus pyogenes• Escherichia coliIt presents with acute onset fever, pain, and tenderness of the affected site. Redness, warmth,swelling, and edema are late features. It most commonly involves the proximal tibia or proximaland distal ends of the femur.It commonly occurs by hematogenous spread following toe infections, ear discharge, toothinfection, sore throat, or a boil. In infants, the source of infection may be umbilical cord infection,heel prick, or IV cannula.Solution to Question 3:Acute osteomyelitis is most likely to cause limb shortening and deformity in infants because of theinvolvement of the growth plate, epiphysis, and the adjacent joint.This occurs because the metaphyseal infection spreads via the blood vessels of the physis (growthplate) to the epiphysis and the adjacent joint. Hence, septic arthritis is frequently associated withacute osteomyelitis in infancy. The resulting damage to the growth plate and septic arthritis of theadjacent joint lead to limb shortening and deformity.Beyond 2 years of age, the physis acts as a barrier preventing the direct spread of metaphysealinfection into the epiphysis. Hence, the metaphyseal infection more commonly spreads to thediaphysis.Solution to Question 4:The given clinical scenario is suggestive of acute osteomyelitis. Vacuum-assisted closure is notused in the management of acute osteomyelitis. It is used in the management of chronicosteomyelitis following extensive debridement.Management of acute osteomyelitis includes the following:• Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy (after taking blood samples for culture and sensitivity)••Surgical drainage - if patient does not respond to antibiotics or if abscess is detected on imagingSupportive therapy - analgesics, IV fluids, and splinting of the limbThe complications of inadequately treated acute osteomyelitis include:•Septicemia• Chronic osteomyelitis289•Septic arthritis• Altered bone growthSolution to Question 5:The first bony lesion of osteomyelitis is seen on an x-ray during the 2nd week of infection. It isdue to periosteal new bone formation and appears as a faint extracortical outline.When osteomyelitis is suspected on clinical grounds, early x-rays show only soft tissue swellingwith no bony abnormality. Hence, the following imaging modalities are highly sensitive and areused to aid the diagnosis within 24-48 hours:• MRI - shows marrow edema within 24-48 hours• Technetium-99 bone scan - shows increased osseous uptake of the tracerSolution to Question 6:In the given radiographs showing features of chronic osteomyelitis, the marked structures are asfollows:• Involucrum is the thick sheath of periosteal new bone that surrounds the sequestrum.• Cloacae are openings in the involucrum that allow drainage of purulent and necrotic materialout of the dead bone.• Sequestrum is a piece of devitalized bone that has been separated from its surrounding boneduring the process of necrosis.Chronic OsteomyelitisInvolucrumRCloacae290SequestrumSolution to Question 7:The given clinical scenario of a patient with a history of an accident 2 years ago, experiencingsymptoms of pain and swelling at the site of injury, and an X-ray of the lower limb revealingsequestrum and involucrum in the tibia, strongly suggests a diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis.Chronic OsteomyelitisInvolucrumSequestrumChronic osteomyelitis may occur by direct inoculation of the infective organism during trauma(like road traffic accidents). The infection continues to thrive within the bone leading toalternating quiescent and flare-up stages of chronic osteomyelitis.Sequestrum is a piece of dead bone. It is formed when a fragment of bone gets separated from thehealthy bone due to necrosis. It varies in size from a spicule to a large fragment and acts as anidus for infection. It leads to abscess and persistent pus discharge in the bone. Sinus tracts areformed when the abscess from the infected bone drains out through the skin.The involucrum is the dense new sclerotic bone surrounding the sequestrum. It is formed fromdeep layers of stripped periosteum. Cloacae are the perforations in the involucrum. Pus and tinyspicules of bone may be discharged through them.The radiograph below shows sequestrum, involucrum and cloacae:291Chronic OsteomyelitisInvolucrumRCloacaeSequestrumOption A: Osteogenic sarcoma characteristically shows the sun-burst appearance and Codman'striangle, as shown below.DAILYROUNDSOption B: Ewing's sarcoma shows an onion-skin appearance of the periosteum, as shown below.292Option D: Multiple myeloma shows multiple punched-out lesions of the bone, as shown below.Solution to Question 8:This clinical scenario and image showing a sinus are suggestive of chronic osteomyelitis. In thiscondition, sequestrum acts as the nidus of infection and is the most common cause of non-healingand recurrence.Sequestrum is a piece of dead bone. It is formed when a fragment of bone gets separated from thehealthy bone due to necrosis. It varies in size from a spicule to a large fragment and acts as anidus for infection. It leads to persistent pus discharge and abscess in the bone. Sinus tracts areformed when the abscess from the infected bone drains out through the skin.293The involucrum is the dense new sclerotic bone surrounding the sequestrum.

Pus and tinyspicules of bone may be discharged through them.Chronic OsteomyelitisInvolucrumRCloacaeSequestrumSolution to Question 9:Paprika sign in chronic osteomyelitis is seen during the curettage of the bone. It refers to activepunctate bleeding on debridement and indicates a healthy tissue surface.The appearance of the paprika sign is an indication that the curettage is adequate. Effectivecurettage is very important as inadequate debridement is one of the reasons for high recurrencerates in chronic osteomyelitis.MRI in chronic osteomyelitis shows rim sign which is a rim of high signal intensity surroundingthe focus of disease.Solution to Question 10:The bony defect left behind after debridement is called dead space. Metal plates are not used in itsmanagement as they act as a nidus of infection and cause recurrent disease. If metal implants arealready in place, they must be replaced by external fixators.The dead space created after debridement in chronic osteomyelitis leads to bony instability. It ismanaged using the following techniques:• PMMA beads (polymethyl methacrylate) impregnated with antibiotics - in initial stages•Cancellous bone graft - later stages• Muscle flap transfer294Solution to Question 11:Brodie's abscess is not a complication of chronic osteomyelitis. It is a subacute variant ofosteomyelitis.The complications of chronic osteomyelitis include:•Pathological fracture - most common, occurs due to devitalization of the bone and sequestrumformation•Squamous cell carcinoma (SC",
        "C": "occurs rarely due to metaplasia in a chronic discharging sinus-• Amyloidosis occurs rarely due to long-standing inflammationSolution to Question 12:Sclerosing osteomyelitis of Garre is characterized by the absence of pus.It is a specific type of chronic osteomyelitis and is caused by a low-grade anaerobic infection thatis effectively contained by the host immune system. Hence, there is no abscess or sequestrumformation.This condition is characterized by an excessive periosteal reaction at the affected site of the bone,causing marked sclerosis and cortical thickening.The given radiograph shows Garre's osteomyelitis:RSolution to Question 13:Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the most common cause of septic arthritis in sexually active youngadults.295Staphylococcus aureus causes septic arthritis in all ages followed by group A Streptococcus andEnterobacter.Solution to Question 14:The given clinical scenario is highly suggestive of septic arthritis. The next best step isthe aspiration of the joint fluid to confirm the diagnosis and identify the organism.Empirical antibiotic therapy has to be started immediately after aspiration. It is not the first stepas giving antibiotics would interfere with the identification of infective organisms from theaspirated fluid. Blood culture is positive only in a few cases and has very little diagnostic value.USG is the most reliable investigation to detect effusion at an early stage. MRI is reserved forinfections in obscure sites like the sacroiliac or sternoclavicular joints.Solution to Question 15:Septic arthritis needs to be treated immediately to prevent the destruction of articular cartilage.When the synovium becomes infected, there is an acute inflammatory response and effusion intothe joint space. Destruction of articular cartilage begins within 2 days of infection and becomesapparent in 4-6 days.There is depletion of ground substance and destruction of collagen due to exposure tocollagenases. This is brought about by enzymes of the inflammatory response, bacterial toxins,and stimulation of T-lymphocytes. This destruction of articular cartilage finally progresses to bonyankylosis.Solution to Question 16:This clinical scenario is suggestive of septic arthritis of the hip joint in an infant. This condition isalso called Tom Smith arthritis.Septic arthritis of the hip in infancy causes severe destruction of the femoral head as it iscartilaginous at this age. This results in limb shortening and increased mobility at the hip jointleading to an unstable gait.The following image shows destruction and deformation of the left femoral head in a child whohad suffered from septic arthritis in infancy.296Septic Arthritis - Destruction ofLeft Femoral HeadOptions A and C: Holstein-Lewis and Tillaux-Chaput are types of fractures.Option B: The Hawkin-Kennedy test is used to diagnose supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teresminor injury as a result of impingement between coracohumeral ligament and the greatertubercule of the humerus.Solution to Question 17:In patients with transient synovitis of the hip, the attitude of the affected limb is flexion,abduction, and external rotation.This attitude maximizes the capsular volume of the hip joint and, thus, minimizes theintracapsular pressure. This leads to a decrease in pain caused by joint effusion.Transient synovitisReactive inflammation following a viral infectionCommon in childrenPainful, but with preserved weight bearingNormal WBC count and ESRSelf-limiting conditionAnalgesics and bed restSeptic arthritisSuppurative infection of the jointMay occur in all age groups,especially with comorbidities(rheumatoid arthritis, immunosuppression)Inability to bear weight on the affected sideHigh WBC count and ESRRequires IV antibiotics and surgical drainage297Solution to Question 18:The given clinical scenario and image showing flexed positioning of the affected finger aredescriptive of Kanavel's sign. It is characteristically positive in infectious flexor tenosynovitis.This sign has four cardinal components:•••Tenderness over the flexor sheathRigid positioning of the finger in flexion• Pain on attempts to hyperextend the fingers•Swelling of the involved partSolution to Question 19:The given clinical scenario of a child with prolonged swelling and pain over the upper tibia, alongwith a radiograph showing a lytic lesion with a dense sclerotic rim and minimal periostealreaction, suggests the diagnosis of Brodie's abscess.Brodie's abscess is a localized form of subacute osteomyelitis that occurs when organisms of lowvirulence infect an immunocompetent host. The abscess is walled off by the thickening of thesurrounding bone trabeculae. It most commonly involves the metaphysis of the proximal tibia anddistal femur.The patient is typically a child or adolescent experiencing prolonged pain near a large joint forseveral weeks or months. Symptoms may include a limp, slight swelling, muscle wasting, andlocalized tenderness.The typical radiographic finding is a circumscribed, round or oval radiolucent cavity measuring1-2 cm in diameter, surrounded by a halo of sclerosis, with minimal or no periosteal reaction. Theradioisotope scan shows markedly increased activity. MRI may be helpful in diagnosis. Openbiopsy with curettage is indicated if there is any doubt in the diagnosis.Differential diagnoses include:• Cystic tuberculosis•⚫ Eosinophilic granuloma• Osteoid osteoma•⚫ Ewing's sarcomaTreatment:• Immobilization and antibiotics (flucloxacillin and fusidic aci",
