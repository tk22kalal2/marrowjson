      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Wrist injury is associated with damage to the median nerve, not the anterior interosseous nerve. Nerve injuries can be associated with closed fractures or open fractures: • Closed fractures are less commonly related to nerve injury, and spontaneous recovery within 4 months is observed in 90% of cases. The nerve is explored if recovery is delayed beyond the expected time, or when nerve conduction studies do not demonstrate any evidence of recovery. • Open fractures are more likely to cause the nerve to be completely severed. The nerve is explored and repaired at the time of debridement or during wound closure.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The earliest symptom of acute compartment syndrome is pain. Acute compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency caused by increased pressure within a fascial compartment, leading to tissue ischemia. It is characterized by rapid progression of pain and swelling in an extremity, commonly precipitated by traumatic injury. The classic features of ischemia in acute compartment syndrome include the 5 P's: \n   • Pain - It is the first symptom of acute compartment syndrome. Ischemic muscle is highly sensitive to touch. On passive stretching of the muscles, severe pain can be elicited.\n   • Paresthesia - It is the first sign of nerve ischemia.\n   • Pallor - It may not be seen always. The skin outside the compartment may be normally perfused, as only the intra-compartmental perfusion may be affected.\n   • Paralysis - Paralysis of muscle groups affected in that compartment is a late sign.\n   • Pulselessness - Usually, the peripheral pulses and capillary return are intact in the early stages, unless there is a major arterial injury. If pulses are absent, arteriography is indicated.\n   The diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring the intra-compartmental pressure using a split catheter introduced into the compartment. The difference between diastolic pressure and compartment pressure is known as differential pressure (ΔP). A differential pressure (ΔP) of less than 30 mm Hg (4.00 kilopascals) is an indication for immediate compartment decompression by performing a fasciotomy.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of crush syndrome. In this condition, hyperkalemia is seen, not hypokalemia. Crush syndrome can result when a limb is compressed for a prolonged period. For example, getting crushed or entrapped in a vehicle or rubble and after extended use of a pneumatic anti-shock garment. This results in hypoperfusion and myonecrosis in the crushed limb. When the limb is released from the compression, toxic metabolites get released to cause reperfusion injury. Crush syndrome can result in a systemic reaction due to tissue necrosis. Free myoglobin can lead to acute tubular necrosis and renal failure. Myonecrosis can lead to metabolic acidosis with hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia. The procoagulants escaped into the systemic circulation can produce systemic coagulopathy. Management of crush syndrome: encouraging high urine flow, along with alkalization of urine with sodium bicarbonate to prevent precipitation of myoglobin in the renal tubules, renal hemofiltration if there is oliguria or renal failure, if compartment syndrome is confirmed, then fasciotomy is performed, radical excision of necrosed muscle to avoid sepsis, and aggressive management of the open wound.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Reperfusion injury is not always local; it can also result in a systemic inflammatory response. Reperfusion injury is the term used for a group of complications that follow the re-establishment of blood flow to ischemic tissues. It can also occur after fasciotomy and following restoration of blood flow to muscles in acute compartment syndrome. Reperfusion results in an inflammatory response in the ischemic tissue, which is probably triggered by muscle breakdown products. These activate the intrinsic clotting system, resulting in microvascular thrombosis. When a large amount of muscle is ischemic, there can be a systemic inflammatory response and systemic coagulopathy. The mediators released into systemic circulation damage the vascular endothelium, leading to increased permeability, transcapillary fluid leakage, worsening of intra-compartmental pressure, and eventually multiple organ failure.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "History of sudden onset breathlessness on the 3rd day of admission after a femur fracture should raise suspicion of fat embolism. Fat embolism is the presence of fat globules in vital organs and peripheral circulation after a fracture of the long bone or other major trauma. Its pathogenesis can be related to 2 factors: the release of free fatty acids by the action of lipases on the neutral fats and the actual obstruction of small pulmonary vessels by fat globules. Clinical features: Early signs are fever and tachycardia. Presenting features are of 2 types - Cerebral type: drowsiness, restlessness, disorientation - Pulmonary type: tachypnea, tachycardia. The classical triad is: Respiratory distress, Neurological abnormalities, Petechial hemorrhages. Pathognomonic signs are petechiae on the trunk, axillae, conjunctival folds, and retina. Treatment of fat embolism is mainly supportive as given below: Respiratory support with oxygen, Heparinization increases lipoprotein lipase activity, Intravenous low molecular weight dextran, Corticosteroids to avoid pneumonitis, Prompt stabilization of long-bone fractures.",

      "explanation": "The earliest muscle to be involved in Volkmann's ischemic contracture is the flexor digitorum profundus. Ischemic contracture of muscles affected by arterial injury or compartment syndrome is known as Volkmann's ischemic contracture. In the forearm, it is most commonly seen following supracondylar humeral fractures. The classical clinical picture of established Volkmann contracture includes: elbow flexion, forearm pronation, wrist flexion, thumb adduction, metacarpophalangeal joint extension, and finger flexion. Treatment: mild deformities - passive stretching of the contracted muscles with a turn-buckle splint (Volkmann's splint); moderate deformities - soft tissue sliding procedures (Maxpage operation); severe deformities - early excision of all necrotic muscles, combined with complete median and ulnar neurolysis, followed by a secondary procedure of tendon transfers to restore function. If motor activity is not present in these tendons, a free innervated Gracilis muscle transfer may be considered.",

It most commonly occurs in the calf veins and less often in the proximal veins of the thigh and pelvis. It is caused due to Virchow's triad: \n   • Hemodynamic changes (stasis or turbulence) \n   • Hypercoagulability \n   • Endothelial injury/dysfunction \n   It is usually asymptomatic. Some patients may present with pain in the calf or thigh. There may be an increase in temperature and pulse rate. Calf swelling and tenderness may be noted. \n   Increased pain on passive dorsiflexion of the foot (Homan's test), although frequently used, is now regarded as an unreliable sign.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and X-ray are suggestive of non-union. Anatomical reduction provides stability and decreases the probability of non-union. Nonunion is when a fracture has failed to heal within the expected time and is unlikely to heal without a new intervention. The US Federal Drug Administration (US FDA) defines non-union as failure to achieve union by 9 months since the injury, and for which there have been no signs of healing for 3 months. Improper immobilization is the most common cause of non-union. Delayed union is when a fracture has failed to heal within the expected time but has the potential to heal without further intervention. Risk factors for non-union include the following: Host-related factors - Advanced age, Malnutrition, Smoking, Endocrine diseases (diabetes), Immunosuppression, Osteoporosis, Vascular diseases, Taking medications that delay bone healing. Fracture-related factors - High-energy fractures, Greater degree of soft tissue injury, Bone loss, Periosteal stripping, Devascularization, Infection/contamination. Treatment-related factors - Lack of good stabilization, Following improper technique such as poor casting, Rigid fixation with bone gaps, NSAIDs (implicated in some studies).",

        "B": "Intertrochanteric",
        "C": "Distal radius",
        "D": "Olecranon fracture"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Among the given fractures, proximal scaphoid fractures are most prone to non-union. Since the nutrient artery enters the scaphoid near its distal end, proximal fractures are associated with avascular necrosis and non-union. The more proximal the fracture in the scaphoid, the higher the chances of avascular necrosis and non-union. Certain bones have a relatively limited or watershed blood supply that can potentially get interrupted by fracture. These include: Head of the femur: after fracture of the neck or posterior dislocation of the hip. Proximal scaphoid: due to fracture through the waist of the scaphoid. Lunate: following a dislocation. Body of talus: after fracture of its neck. Fractures in these sites have a higher risk for non-union or development of osteonecrosis. Other options: Option B: Intertrochanteric fractures involve either the greater or lesser trochanters or both, more common in the elderly following a history of a fall. Malunion is the most frequent complication. The vast metaphyseal region has an abundant blood supply, contributing to a higher union rate and fewer chances of avascular necrosis. Option C: Distal radius fractures occur by fall on an outstretched hand and they include Colles' fracture (most common), Smith's fracture, Barton's fracture, and Chauffer's fracture. The complications include joint stiffness, malunion (more common), carpal tunnel syndrome, subluxation of the inferior radio-ulnar joint, Sudeck's dystrophy, and rupture of the extensor pollicis longus tendon. Avascular necrosis or non-union is rare. Option D: Olecranon fracture results from a direct injury as in a fall onto the point of the elbow. Complications include non-union, elbow stiffness, and osteoarthritis.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given X-ray shows hypertrophic non-union of the tibia. Although the enlarged fracture ends suggest active osteogenesis, the gap is not bridged because of inadequate stability. Such non-unions have adequate vascularity and display abundant callus. Based on the biologic potential for fracture healing, non-union can be of the following types: \n   • Atrophic: Poor healing response with no callus formation due to little or no active bone-forming cells at the fracture site. The blood supply is typically poor. On radiography, there is an absence of bone reaction.\n   • Oligotrophic: There is minimal callus formation, often due to inadequate approximation of fracture surfaces. On radiography, there is minimal bone healing reaction.\n   • Hypertrophic: These fractures have an adequate healing response and good vascularity. There is a lack of adequate stability for the union to occur. On radiography, there is usually abundant callus formation with an intervening dark area of fibrocartilage-lacking mineral. It can occur after initial nonoperative management or in some cases after initial operative management where there was inadequate stabilization.\n   Pseudoarthrosis has features of hypertrophic nonunion, but due to excessive and chronic motility, there is the formation of a pseudo-capsule containing fluid similar to an actual synovial joint.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Stabilization using casts and braces are used in the treatment of hypertrophic nonunion. Management of nonunion: • Hypertrophic nonunion: Stabilization to allow chondrocyte-mediated mineralization of the fibrocartilage between fracture ends. With stabilization, healing usually occurs by 8 weeks. • Oligotrophic nonunion: Correcting the issues related to bone contact through mechanical compression or bone grafting to close the defects. In some cases, a combination of biologic and mechanical methods is used. • Atrophic nonunion: Autogenous bone graft or BMP to provide biologic stimulus at the fracture site. The other procedure done is debridement or excision of the non-vital bone ends. • Pseudoarthrosis: Debridement of the pseudoarthrosis, opening of the medullary canal and providing more stability usually with compression at the nonunion site.

      "explanation": "Internal fixation is not a common strategy used in the treatment of infected non-unions. This is because metal implants promote adherence of microbes and cause biofilm formation. They also adversely affect phagocytosis and control of infection. The diagnostic gold standard for detecting infection in fracture nonunion sites is deep tissue or bone culture. Strategies used in the management of infected non-unions include: \n      • Removal of internal implants if the infection is problematic or when bone grafting is required. Implants are retained if the infection can be controlled and union can be achieved without grafting procedures.\n      • Management of the infectious process by debridement of the infected nonviable bone and surrounding nonviable soft tissues, parenteral antibiotics, and bone stabilization.\n      • Local antibiotic delivery may be performed, especially when there is dead space due to debridement.
