        "D": "Undisplaced fractures are immobilized at 90 degrees"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Posterior displacement or extension type is more common in a supracondylar fracture of the humerus. It is the most common fracture following a fall on an outstretched hand. Most commonly seen in children between 5-8 years of age. On examination, an S-shaped deformity may be seen at the elbow. If the proximal fracture fragment is sharp and has penetrated the muscles and fascia, a dimple may be seen on the skin above the elbow (dimple sign). Fractures are broadly classified into either extension or flexion types. Extension type fractures are further classified using Gartland's classification as: Type I - Undisplaced fractures, Type II - Displaced fractures but with intact posterior cortex, Type III - Displaced fractures, with no intact posterior cortex, and the fragment may be displaced either posteromedially or posterolaterally. Characteristic displacements include medial rotation/medial tilt, impaction/proximal shift, dorsal displacement/dorsal tilt. Supracondylar fracture of the humerus: On radiology, a sail sign/fat pad sign - an undisplaced fracture may show a triangular lucency like a sail of a yacht. This is due to the fat pad around the elbow being pushed forward by a hematoma. Fish-tail sign - due to rotation of the distal fragment, the anterior border of the proximal fragment looks like a sharp spike. Baumann's angle/humeral-capitellar angle - can help in assessing the degree of medial angulation before reduction. Fat pad or sail sign. Treatment includes: Undisplaced fractures - immobilization at 90 degrees flexion in a cast for 3 weeks. Comminuted or compound fractures - Dunlop's (skin) or Smith's (skeletal) traction. Displaced fractures - closed reduction with percutaneous fixation. In open or severely displaced fractures or fractures with vascular damage, open reduction with K-wire fixation is indicated.",

        "D": "Cubitus valgus deformity"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The given X-ray shows a supracondylar fracture of the humerus. Malunion leading to cubitus varus (gunstock deformity) is the most common complication following this fracture. Cubitus valgus is a very rare complication. Cubitus varus is characterized by posterior displacement, horizontal rotation, and coronal tilt of the distal fragment. Correction methods include: Lateral closed-wedge osteotomy and Medial open-wedge osteotomy (King's osteotomy). The images below show gunstock deformity. Complications of supracondylar fracture of the humerus can occur early or late. Early complications: Vascular injury - to the brachial artery resulting in Volkmann's ischemia, Compartment syndrome, Volkmann's ischemic contracture, Nerve injury - to the anterior interosseous nerve > median > radial > ulnar nerve. Late complications: Gunstock deformity, Elbow stiffness, Heterotopic ossification (myositis ossificans). Patients with anterior interosseous nerve injury are unable to perform the OK sign. This is due to weak flexor digitorum profundus and flexor pollicis longus muscles. The fingers get pinched, and instead of the tips, the volar surfaces of the thumb and index finger make contact.",

      "explanation": "Fracture of the lateral condyle of the humerus is most likely to be seen in a child with a fall on an outstretched hand in a varus position. A large fragment of bone, including the lateral condyle, breaks off and is pulled away by the attached wrist extensors. The normal 3-point bony relationship at the elbow is lost. It is a Salter-Harris type IV injury as it crosses the growth plate and the epiphysis. It is an intra-articular fracture. These fractures are managed surgically (fracture of necessity) with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using either screws or K-wire. Non-union is commonly seen in these fractures. If left untreated, the lateral growth plate fails to grow, while the medial one continues to grow, resulting in a cubitus valgus deformity.",

        "D": "It is treated by extending and pronating the forearm"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given scenario of spinning the child by holding his hands, followed by features suggesting pain and inability to use the arm, points to a diagnosis of pulled elbow. Pulled elbow or nursemaid's elbow refers to the dislocation of the radial head over the annular ligament, commonly seen in children under the age of 6 years. The mechanism of injury is through axial traction on the extended and pronated forearm. This happens when a child is pulled, lifted, or swung by the arm. Following the dislocation, the child holds the arm relatively immobile, with the elbow extended and the forearm pronated, and resists supination. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, though X-rays are usually obtained to exclude a fracture. To treat the condition, simple analgesia is administered, and while the child's attention is diverted, the elbow is extended and pronated to relocate the radial head with a snap. This technique is preferred over the alternative method of supination and flexion, which tends to be more painful and less successful.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Posterior dislocations are the most common type of elbow dislocation. The elbow joint is the most common joint to dislocate in children. They usually result from a fall on the outstretched hand with the elbow in extension. It may be associated with soft tissue injury involving the brachial artery, ulnar, median, and radial nerve. These dislocations occur with a progression from lateral to the medial side, termed as Hori's circle. Complete dislocation is usually associated with disruption of the medial and lateral collateral ligaments and anterior capsule. Patients present with severe pain at the elbow, and with the elbow in flexion. The three bony points relationship is disturbed. The triceps tendon becomes prominent (bowstringing of triceps). Reduction is done under anesthesia followed by immobilization in an above-elbow plaster slab for 3 weeks.",

      "explanation": "Rupture of the extensor pollicis longus tendon (EPL) occasionally occurs as a late complication of Colles' fracture. This probably results from damage to the tendon by the sharp edges of the fracture fragments. It is followed by aseptic necrosis of a section of the tendon due to compression in the callus, leading to attrition rupture. Complications of Colles' fracture: \nJoint stiffness - Finger stiffness is the most common complication. Wrist, elbow, and shoulder are the other joints that can become stiff. \nMalunion - is the second most common complication, and leads to a dinner fork deformity. \nSudeck's osteodystrophy/reflex sympathetic dystrophy. \nRupture of extensor pollicis longus tendon. \nCarpal tunnel syndrome - causing median nerve compression. \nNon-union - extremely rare.",

Displaced fractures - Closed manipulative reduction and immobilization in a Colles' cast. Comminuted fractures in young adults - Surgical correction with percutaneous K-wire fixation, external fixators, or locking compression plates. The technique of reduction of Colles' fracture is as follows: Disimpaction of the fracture fragments by longitudinal traction against counter-traction provided by the assistant. The distal fragment is then pressed into palmar flexion followed by ulnar deviation. The patient's hand is drawn into pronation, palmar flexion, and ulnar deviation. A Colles' cast is then applied, extending from below the elbow to the metacarpal heads, with the wrist in palmar flexion and ulnar deviation.

      "explanation": "The provided history of falling on an outstretched arm and the X-ray revealing an oblique fracture in the lower third of the radius with dislocation of the distal radio-ulnar joint point to the diagnosis of Galeazzi's fracture. Galeazzi's fracture is the fracture of the lower third of the radius and the subluxation or dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint. This injury usually happens when one falls on an outstretched hand. Patients present with pain, swelling, and deformity at the lower end of the radius. On examination, the disruption of the radio-ulnar joint can be elicited by pressing the lower end of the ulna. The ulna moves down and comes back like the key of a piano (piano-key sign). The aim of treatment for this fracture is to preserve supination and pronation of the forearm. In children, closed reduction is usually enough to achieve perfect reduction. However, in adults, open reduction using a K-wire fixation or compression plating is usually required. It is also important to look for ulnar nerve damage. Galeazzi's fracture can cause complications such as malunion due to displacement of the fragment. This often results in deformity and limitation in supination and pronation.",

Dislocation of the head of the radius can be detected using McLaughlin's line (radiocapitellar line). A line drawn along the center of the shaft of the radius will cut the capitellum of the humerus in the center irrespective of the position of the elbow. In Monteggia fracture, this relationship is disturbed. The mechanism of injury in these fractures is usually a fall on the outstretched hand. Clinical features include: Deformity in the proximal forearm - due to ulnar fracture. The dislocation of the head of the radius may be masked by the swelling. Pain and tenderness on the lateral side of the elbow - due to proximal radioulnar dislocation. Monteggia fracture is treated surgically (fracture of necessity). The ulnar fracture is reduced and bone restored to full length. It is then fixed with a plate and screws. The radial head usually reduces once the ulna is fixed.",
