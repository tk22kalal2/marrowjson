These fractures may be either undisplaced or displaced. The tendon of the quadriceps muscle is attached to the upper surface of the patella. These fractures are usually caused by the excessive pull of the quadriceps muscle, either due to excessive contractions or sudden resisted extension of the knee.",

In this method, two K-wires are used to transfix the reduced patellar fragments and a flexible wire is looped around them tightly. Treatment options for patellar fracture are: \n   • Undisplaced patellar fractures with minimal joint incongruity and intact extensor retinaculum - cylinder cast\n   • Displaced patellar fractures - tension band wiring\n   • Severely comminuted fractures with difficulty in reducing fragments - patellectomy\n   Note: Tension band wiring with cancellous screw is done when compressive forces are also needed along with tensile forces to resist the displacement of fractures, e.g., olecranon fractures.",

The x-ray may be normal initially but later show a hairline crack. After a period of 4-6weeks, a mass of callus can be identified.Management: Reduction and splinting are not necessary as it is an undisplaced fracture. Normalwalking is permitted while using an elastic bandage on the forefoot.The below image shows a March fracture of the second metatarsal bone.189Note: According to Campbell orthopedics (14th edition) in March fractures, patients often note thegradual onset of pain directly over the second metatarsal neck region.
