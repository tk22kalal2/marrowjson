Itusually affects the diaphysis of long bones like the femur and tibia. The femur is the mostcommonly affected, followed by the tibia, humerus and fibula, but overall the pelvis accounts forthe majority of cases.Pain is the earliest symptom, followed by swelling and a low-grade fever. Serologically, the ESRand WCC may be elevated and haemoglobin may be reduced.An x-ray shows an aggressive, poorly defined osteolytic lesion with cortical destruction andperiosteal reaction. A distinct 'onion-skin' appearance is observed due to the destruction of thecortex and new bone formation in layers.Histologically, Ewing's sarcoma is composed of primitive, undifferentiated, small, round blue cellswith large nuclei and scant cytoplasm that bears no resemblance to normal tissue. Thecharacteristic translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22 results in a fusion gene,EWSR1-FL11, which is present in 90% of cases. The presence of the translocation may be495supported by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).Immunohistochemical staining for MIC-2 is specific for Ewing's sarcoma.The most common sites of metastasis include lungs, bones and lymph nodes. Bone marrowinvolvement is a unique feature of Ewing's sarcoma.Preoperative chemotherapy with vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin and etoposide results inextensive tumour necrosis and shrinkage. Wide excision may be combined with adjuvantradiotherapy if surgical margins are poor. Definitive radiotherapy rather than surgical excisionmay be advocated if it is non-resectable or metastasis has occurred. It is a radio-sensitive tumour.Indicators of a favourable prognosis include younger age, involvement of distal appendicular sites,small tumour volume, normal ESR and greater chemotherapy response.",

It is an uncommon malignantmesenchymal neoplasm.498Synovial sarcomas are morphologically biphasic i.e. they have nests of epithelioid cellssurrounded by malignant spindle cells.",

      "question": "Detailed ExplanationsThe most common malignant lesions of the bone are metastases.The most common site of metastasis in the skeleton is vertebra. Bony metastases are morecommon above 50 years of age.The most common primary tumor giving rise to bony metastases is carcinoma breast. However, inchildren under 6 years of age the most common cause of bony secondaries is adrenalneuroblastoma. Carcinoma lung and carcinoma kidney are often implicated in cases of bonymetastases from an unknown primary.Solution to Question 2:The most common primary malignancy of the bone is multiple myeloma which is a tumor ofhematological origin. The most common non-hematologic primary malignancy of boneis osteosarcoma. However, in the first decade of life, the most common non-hematologic primarybone malignancy is Ewing's sarcoma.The most common malignant lesions of the bone overall are metastases. The non-hematologicprimary tumors of the bone arranged in decreasing order of incidence are: osteosarcoma &gt;chondrosarcoma &gt; Ewing's sarcoma.The most common benign bone tumour is osteochondroma. However, it is not a true tumor as itstops growing after skeletal maturity. Hence, the most common benign true bone tumour isosteoid osteoma.Solution to Question 3:Osteosarcoma is a highly radio-resistant tumour.Solution to Question 4:The given X-ray shows the Codman triangle which is suggestive of osteosarcoma.Osteosarcoma is the most common non-hematologic primary malignancy of bone. It occurs mostcommonly in the second decade of life. It is typically metaphyseal. Distal femur, proximal tibiaand proximal humerus are the common sites.488The Codman's triangle is marked out in the X-ray given below. It is formed due to raising of theperiosteum by the tumor.Codman triangleSolution to Question 5:Among the given options, osteosarcoma is the most likely diagnosis as it is a pulsatile bonetumour. Pulsations in the tumour occur due to hypervascularity.Pulsatile bone tumours include:•Osteosarcoma•Aneurysmal bone cyst••Angioendothelioma of boneOsteoclastoma/Giant cell tumour• Metastases from kidney and thyroid carcinomaSolution to Question 6:Chicken wire pattern of calcification on HPE is seen in chondroblastoma.An osteosarcoma shows the following radiological features:•Irregular destruction in the metaphysis overshadowed by the formation of new bone• Codman's triangle or lifting of the periosteum due to the formation of new bone inciting aperiosteal reaction• Bone formation along the blood vessels within the tumour centrifugally, giving rise to sunburst(sunray) appearanceThe image given below shows the sunburst appearance seen in osteosarcoma.489DAILYROUNDSThe image given below shows Codman's triangle seen in osteosarcoma.Codman triangleSolution to Question 7:Bone marrow biopsy is not performed for the evaluation of a patient of osteosarcoma. However, abone biopsy is done for confirmation of the diagnosis by histopathology.An MRI of the involved bone is always done for the evaluation of an osteosarcoma. It shows theextent of the tumour. A bone scan is useful for detecting skeletal metastases.An osteosarcoma can metastasise to the lungs as well so a chest CT may be done. It is a sensitivedetector of lung metastases but chest X-rays are done more commonly.490Solution to Question 8:The presence of pleomorphic cells surrounded by osteoid on histological examination ischaracteristic of osteosarcoma. To establish the diagnosis, osteoid production from the tumourcells must be demonstrated histologically.The image given below shows the histopathology of osteosarcoma.OsteosarcomaPleomorphictumour cellsOsteoidSolution to Question 9:The given clinical scenario, involving a child and a gross specimen revealing a metaphyseal tumorin the distal femur that has infiltrated through the cortex, lifted the periosteum, and extendedthrough the epiphyseal plate, supports the diagnosis of osteosarcoma.A giant cell tumor (option",

It occurs mostcommonly in the second decade of life. It is typically metaphyseal. The distal femur, proximaltibia, and proximal humerus are common sites.Morphologically, osteosarcomas are bulky, gritty, gray-white tumors, often with hemorrhage andcystic degeneration. They destroy cortices, form soft tissue masses, and spread extensively in themedullary canal, replacing hematopoietic marrow. Although infrequent, they may also penetratethe epiphyseal plate or enter the joint.Radiological features:• Irregular destruction in the metaphysis overshadowed by the formation of new bone.Lifting of the periosteum (Codman triangle) due to the formation of new bone inciting aperiosteal reaction491• Bone formation along the blood vessels within the tumor centrifugally, giving rise to a sunburst(sunray) appearanceOsteosarcoma - Codman TriangleSolution to Question 10:In the given scenario, as safe margins are difficult to achieve with wide resection of theosteosarcoma, treatment involves:• Neoadjuvant chemotherapy to control metastasis and to treat micrometastasis••Limb ablation surgery - as safe margins are difficult to achieveAdjuvant chemotherapy - after the surgery to prevent recurrenceChemotherapy is given based on the T-10 protocol. It involves:•High dose methotrexate and citrovorum factor rescue• Adriamycin• BCD (bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, dactinomycin/doxorubicin)Low-grade tumours, with resectable margins, are treated with wide resection and amputationwithout chemotherapy.Radiotherapy can be given pre-operatively to prevent tumor dissemination by surgical trauma.Solution to Question 11:The earliest site of metastasis in osteosarcoma is the lungs.Osteosarcomas are aggressive lesions and metastasize through the bloodstream. Approximately15% of patients with osteosarcoma have detectable pulmonary metastases at the time of diagnosis.492Solution to Question 12:The given X-ray shows multiple, punched-out, sharply demarcated, lytic lesions without anysurrounding reactive sclerosis. This along with the given clinical scenario are suggestiveof multiple myeloma.Clinical features of multiple myeloma include:• Chronic low back pain•• Increased susceptibility to bacterial infections• Anaemia•Bony tendernessThe X-ray given below shows punched-out lytic lesions in the skull of a patient with multiplemyeloma. This is characteristically known as the moth-eaten appearance of skull.Solution to Question 13:The most common symptom in multiple myeloma is bone pain.Clinical features of multiple myeloma:• Bone pain• Fatigue•Weight loss• Anemia• Hypercalcemia493• Renal failure• Peripheral neuropathy•Susceptibility to bacterial infectionsSolution to Question 14:Moth-eaten appearance of bone is seen in multiple myeloma.
