It is a benign unilocular cyst filled with straw colouredserosanguinous fluid.The commonest site is the proximal humerus. They are usually asymptomatic, but pathologicalfractures may occur through the cyst wall and may cause pain and swelling. The cyst may causegrowth disturbances due to its proximity to the growth plate.On X-ray, a bone fracture fragment may be seen resting in a dependent portion of the cyst. This isknown as the fallen fragment/fallen leaf sign and it is pathognomonic of a simple bone cyst.The trapdoor sign is a variant of the fallen leaf sign. Here, a periosteal hinge keeps the fragmentfrom falling dependently and allows it to change position with a change in the patient's position.",

On x-ray, the tumor appears as a well-circumscribed, round, or oval lytic lesion inthe center of the epiphysis of long bones, with areas of calcification within the tumor, giving thecharacteristic mottled appearance.

Histopathologically, Langerhans cells have a single large nucleus with a characteristic foldedor grooved nucleus (\"coffee-bean\" appearance) with small inconspicuous nucleoli.

Spontaneoushealing of the lesion usually occurs within 3 to 4 years.• Patients having lesions of the pelvis or long bones of the extremities can be treated withpercutaneous radiofrequency ablation. This method is not preferred for vertebral lesions andlesions of small bones of hand and feet.•Surgical management involves removal of the entire nidus. This can be accomplished bycurettage or en bloc resection.•Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) ablation is a new method that isunder investigation.",
