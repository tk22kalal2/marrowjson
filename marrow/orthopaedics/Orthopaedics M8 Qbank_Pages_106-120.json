        "D": "A Herbert screw is used for internal fixation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given clinical presentation and the X-ray are suggestive of a scaphoid fracture. Nonunion is a common complication of this condition, while malunion is rare. A scaphoid fracture characteristically presents with tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox following a fall on an outstretched hand. Recent fractures are less likely to be visible on an AP view X-ray; hence, an oblique X-ray view is preferred. Common complications of scaphoid fracture include: non-union and delayed union, avascular necrosis, and wrist osteoarthritis. Treatment includes: undisplaced fractures - immobilization in a scaphoid cast applied in a glass-holding position; displaced fractures - open reduction and internal fixation using a Herbert screw.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The proximal fragment of the scaphoid undergoes avascular necrosis following a fracture. This is because the blood supply of the scaphoid is from its distal end to the proximal end. A fracture disrupts the blood supply to the proximal part.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Lunate is dislocated anteriorly but the rest of the carpals remain in position",
        "B": "Lunate remains in position but the rest dislocate dorsally",

        "D": "Tavernier's maneuver is used for closed reduction"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Among the given options, statement A is incorrect. A fall on a dorsiflexed hand may tear the tough ligaments that normally bind the carpal bones, leading to dislocations. In perilunate dislocation, the lunate remains in position in the lunate fossa of the distal radius but the rest of the carpals dislocate dorsally. It is frequently associated with compression of the median nerve. Prompt reduction reduces swelling and potential damage to the median nerve. The Tavernier maneuver is the most commonly used method of closed reduction. It involves locking the capitate into the distal concavity of the lunate. If the injury cannot be reduced using this method, urgent reduction in the theater should be performed. In lunate dislocation, the lunate dislocates anteriorly while the rest of the carpal bones remain in place.",

        "D": "Distal radio-ulnar joint instability"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Terry-Thomas sign is most likely to be seen in patients with scapholunate instability. It denotes the increased gap between the scaphoid and the lunate. A scapholunate gap of >3mm is suggestive of instability. It results from tearing of the scapholunate ligament following a fall on an outstretched hand. The given x-ray shows the Terry-Thomas sign. The sign is named after Terry Thomas, a British comedian with a visible gap between his two maxillary central incisors.",

      "explanation": "The given scenario and radiograph point to a diagnosis of Bennett's fracture. Bennett's fracture is an oblique, simple intra-articular fracture of the base of the first metacarpal bone. The given image shows Bennett's fracture. Option B: Rolando's fracture is an intra-articular comminuted fracture of the base of the first metacarpal. Option C: Boxer's fracture is the fracture of the fifth metacarpal neck.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Bennett's fracture is difficult to maintain in a reduced state due to the pull of the abductor pollicis longus tendon on the shaft of the first metacarpal. The small fractured fragment remains in contact with the trapezium, but the rest of the metacarpal shaft is pulled proximally by the abductor pollicis longus tendon that is attached to its base. In contrast, the comminuted fracture line of Rolando's fracture prevents the pull of the abductor pollicis longus tendon from being exerted on the metacarpal shaft.",

      "question": "A young man presents to the casualty with pain over his hand. He hesitantly mentions that he punched a wall in an anger outburst. A radiograph of his hand is shown below. Which of the following is false about this injury?",
      "options": {
        "A": "MCP joints are kept in full flexion for safe immobilization",
        "B": "Strength of the grip is significantly affected",
        "C": "It is an intra-articular fracture",
        "D": "Cast is applied in James position"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given scenario and image showing an extra-articular fracture of the fifth metacarpal neck points to boxer's fracture. The strength of grip decreases in this fracture as the fourth and fifth fingers are responsible for the power grip of the hand. Boxer's fracture is caused by striking an object with a closed fist, as seen in boxing, or occasionally by a direct injury. The POP cast is applied in James' position/the position of safe immobilization for metacarpal fractures. Position of safe immobilization: Wrist slightly extended, MCP joints in full flexion and the IP joints extended, thumb in abduction. This prevents stiffness and contractures as the ligaments are at their longest in this position. Position of safe immobilization for metacarpal fractures (James' Position): Wrist is slightly extended, MCP joints in full flexion, IP joints extended and thumb in abduction.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given radiograph showing a fracture of the radial styloid process points to a diagnosis of Chauffeur's fracture. It is caused either by direct trauma to the wrist or traumatic radial deviation of the wrist. Option A: Barton's fracture is an intra-articular fracture of the distal radius with volar subluxation of the wrist. Option C: Smith's fracture is a distal radial fracture with associated volar angulation of the distal fracture fragment. It is also called reverse Colles fracture. Option D: Rolando's fracture is an intra-articular comminuted fracture of the base of the first metacarpal.",

        "D": "Dorsal hyperextension splints are used in the treatment"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given scenario and image showing a flexed fingertip are suggestive of a mallet finger. It results from sudden, forced flexion of the fingertip. Mallet finger is also known as baseball finger. It is caused by the disruption of the extensor tendon at the distal interphalangeal joint. This leads to unopposed action of the flexor tendon resulting in a flexed fingertip. Passive extension of the distal interphalangeal joint is preserved. Avulsion injury of the extensor tendon at the DIP joint - Mallet finger. Dorsal hyperextension splints are used for immobilization of the joint. The given image shows a hyperextension splint.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of a jersey finger. Avulsion of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon from the distal phalanx results in this condition. This injury commonly occurs in rugby and football players. Patients are unable to flex the distal end of the finger. Option B: Boutonniere's deformity presents as a flexion deformity of the PIP joint and extension of the DIP joint. It occurs as a result of the rupture of the middle slip of the extensor tendon followed by the separation of the lateral slips. The head of the proximal phalanx thrusts through this gap like a button through a buttonhole.",

Kienbock's disease refers to the avascular necrosis of the lunate leading to progressive wrist pain. Patients present with tenderness over the lunate and stiffness of the wrist joint. Option A: Sever's disease or calcaneal apophysitis refers to the inflammation of the calcaneus growth plate in growing children. Option C: Kohler's disease refers to the avascular necrosis of the navicular bone. Option D: Osgood-Schlatter disease or tibial tubercle apophysitis refers to the inflammation of the patellar ligament at the tibial tuberosity. It is characterized by a painful swelling just below the knee. It worsens with activity and is relieved by rest.",
