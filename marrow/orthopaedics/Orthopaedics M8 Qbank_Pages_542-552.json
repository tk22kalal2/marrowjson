      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and a positive McMurray's test indicate a meniscal injury.In this test, the patient is made to lie in the supine position and the knee is completely flexed. Onehand is used to stabilize and palpate the knee joint, while the other hand is used to internally orexternally rotate the leg, depending on which meniscus is to be tested. The leg is then slowlyextended. Any palpable or audible click indicates injury to the menisci.Passive flexion and extension of kneePassive flexion of kneeMedial rotation of knee (click heard in meniscal injumPassive extension of kneeMARROWOther tests used to detect meniscal injury include:•Apley's grinding test•Thessaly test•Squat test•Ege's test• Joint line tenderness test548Apley's test: In this test, the patient is made to lie in the prone position. The knee is flexed to 90ºand rotated while a compression force is applied, which is called the grinding test. Thereproduction of symptoms indicates a torn meniscus. The distraction test involves repeatedrotation while the leg is pulled upwards by the examiner, holding the thigh down. This producesincreased pain only if there is ligament damage.Apley's testGrinding testOMARROWDistraction testThessaly test: With the affected knee flexed to 20° and the foot placed flat on the ground, thepatient bears his full weight on that leg while being supported by the examiner. The patient isthen asked to twist his or her body to one side and then to the other three times.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Meniscal injury is mainly caused by rotational force on a partially flexed knee.549The rotational forces at the knee compress and rotate the menisci anteriorly or posteriorly,causing a tear. The medial meniscus is less mobile than the lateral meniscus and hence is moreprone to injury.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Medial collateral ligament injury does not lead to hemarthrosis, as it is an extra-articularstructure.The cruciate ligaments and menisci are intra-articular structures and hence their injury leads tohemarthroses.",

      "explanation": "In a patient with an injury to the tibial (medial) collateral ligament, the abduction or valgus stresstest would be positive.The abduction or valgus stress test is done as follows:•The patient is made to lie in the supine position.•.One hand of the examiner is placed on the lateral aspect of the knee for support.• The other hand is placed over the ankle.• Gentle abduction or valgus stress is applied to the knee while the hand at the ankle externallyrotates the leg slightly, and the knee is flexed to 30°.The test is said to be positive when pain is reproduced, or there is excessive gapping at the medialjoint. The below image shows the abduction or valgus stress test.Adduction or varus stress test is positive in patients with a lateral collateral ligament injury.550Dial test is used to assess the posterolateral instability.

      "explanation": "Patella baja is an abnormally low-lying patella and is not responsible for recurrent dislocation ofthe patella.Causes for recurrent dislocation of the patella include:• Excessive joint laxity as in connective tissue disorders like EDS, Marfan's syndrome• Patella alta - the patella is high-lying in the shallow part of the inter-condylar groove• Trochlear dysplasia• Small patella• Genu valgumGiven below is a lateral radiograph of the knee joint showing the Insall-Salvati index. This isthe ratio of the patella tendon length (LT) to the length of the patella (LP).••In patients with high-lying patella, the ratio is above 1.2.

      "explanation": "The presence of swelling around the medial malleolus and increased medial joint space onradiography indicates injury to the deltoid ligament.The deltoid ligament is present on the medial side of the ankle joint and the fibers are attached tothe medial malleolus. Hence injury to it can lead to the widening of the medial joint space, best551visualized on the mortise view of an ankle radiograph.The below image shows the attachment of the deltoid ligament.TibiaMedial malleolusFibulaDeltoid ligamentSubtalar jointMedial view",

        "D": "Achilles tendinitisCorrect Option"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The above clinical scenario and positive Thompson's test point to a diagnosis of Achilles tendonrupture.Achilles tendon rupture is usually seen in those playing sports like squash, badminton, andfootball. The pain is acute and the patient can feel a ripping or popping sensation at the back ofthe heel. The patient would be unable to plantarflex the affected foot.In Thompson's test, the patient lies prone with his foot over the end of the examination table. Theexaminer squeezes the calf muscles, specifically the gastrocnemius-soleus complex, with his hand.This should normally cause contraction of the Achilles tendon, resulting in plantar flexion. If theAchilles tendon is completely ruptured, plantar flexion would be absent.Achilles tendinitis is usually seen in athletes, joggers, and hikers. It is caused due to the localirritation of the tendon sheath. Patients present with gradually progressive pain over the Achillestendon. On examination, there may be thickening of the tendon with inflammation over theaffected area.Ultrasound may be needed to exclude tendon tear or rupture. It is usually treated byphysiotherapy.552",
