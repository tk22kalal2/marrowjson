Classifications used for neck of femur fracture are: Based on the location of the fracture line, Pauwels classification, Garden classification, and Delbet classification (hip fractures in the pediatric population). Based on the location of the fracture line, it can be classified as: Sub-capital fracture at the junction of head and neck, Transcervical fracture in the neck, and Basal-cervical - fracture at the base of the neck. Pauwels classification of fracture neck of femur: Reference line, Fracture line, I stage <30° (30-50% 50°). Type I, Type II, Type III. Incomplete fracture line. Garden classification of fracture neck of femur: II Stage Complete fracture line; non-displaced, III Stage Complete fracture line; partially displaced (All three sets of trabeculae are out of alignment), IV stage Complete fracture line; completely displaced (Trabeculae between acetabulum and head are realigned). Delbet classification is used for hip fractures in children. They are grouped into four types based on their location as follows: Type I Transepiphyseal fracture, Type II - Transcervical fracture, Type III Cervicotrochanteric fracture, Type IV - Intertrochanteric fracture.",

      "explanation": "The plane of reference in Pauwel's classification is the horizontal plane. This classification is based on Pauwel's angle, i.e., the angle made by the fracture line in reference to the horizontal plane. Pauwel's classification of fracture neck of femur: Reference line - Fracture line <30° - 30-50% - 50° - Type I - Type II - Type III. When the Pauwel's angle is small, compressive forces act at the fracture ends and hence the fracture is stable. As Pauwel's angle increases, the fracture line becomes more vertical and the shearing forces act on the fractured ends. Hence, at higher angles, the fracture becomes unstable.",

      "explanation": "In the given clinical scenario with a 3-week-old femoral head fracture, the next step will be to do an MRI hip. This is to evaluate the femoral head for compromise in the blood supply. Treatment of the femoral head fracture depends on the findings seen on an MRI: Femoral head shows compromised blood supply - reduction with fibular bone graft or muscle pedicle graft. Femoral head shows signs of osteonecrosis and acetabulum is normal - hemiarthroplasty. Femoral head is normal but the fracture is nearly vertical (can develop to non-union) - osteotomy.",

      "explanation": "In McMurray's osteotomy, the distal fragment is displaced medially and is abducted. This converts shearing stresses at the fracture site to compressive forces, promoting faster healing. McMurray's osteotomy is an oblique osteotomy directed medially upwards at the inter-trochanteric region. It is based on the biomechanical principle. After the medial displacement of the femur, the weight-bearing line passes from the head to the distal fragment. It, therefore, bypasses the fracture site.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of non-union of femoral neck fracture after ORIF, as there is no evidence of healing 6-12 months post-operatively. Lack of cambium layer in the periosteum of the neck of femur is one of the causes of non-union. Causes for non-union in the neck of femur fracture are as follows: Inadequate blood supply of the femoral head. Since the fracture is intra-articular, the synovial fluid interferes with fracture healing. Lack of the cambium layer of periosteum, which produces the callus. Inadequate reduction and poor internal fixation. Improper immobilization.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Avascular necrosis is a late complication of fracture neck of the femur, which can be diagnosed on X-ray only after a few months to 2 years after the injury. Hence, MRI is the best investigation for diagnosis. The amount of vascular damage produced at the time of fracture determines the probability of the development of osteonecrosis. In addition to this, the blood supply to the femoral head may also be disrupted during internal fixation. Hence, avascular necrosis can also occur in united femur fractures. More proximally the fracture is located, worse is the prognosis. Hence, sub-capital fractures have the worst prognosis. Patients with sickle cell disease are at an increased risk for developing avascular necrosis of the femoral head.",

      "explanation": "In this clinical scenario, the presence of reduced SpO2 and altered mental status in a patient presenting within 72 hours following a long bone fracture suggests the diagnosis of a fat embolism. Fat embolism is caused by the fat globules originating from the bone marrow following the fracture of long bones. Clinical features of fat embolism are usually seen within 72 hours. They include tachycardia, fever, breathlessness, petechiae, confusion, and restlessness. Gurd's criteria are used for the diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome. There is no specific diagnostic test for fat embolism. However, urine analysis to detect fat globules and monitoring of blood pO2 levels are conducted. The management of fat embolism primarily involves supportive care, including oxygen therapy and prompt stabilization of long-bone fractures. Option A: Pulmonary embolism most commonly occurs as a result of thrombi from deep vein thrombosis of the leg. Option C: Acute respiratory distress syndrome is diagnosed using the Berlin's criteria. All four of the following conditions must be met: it develops within 1 week of clinical insult or worsening respiratory symptoms. Chest radiograph shows bilateral opacities consistent with pulmonary edema. These opacities are not fully explained by effusions, lobar or lung collapse, or nodules. The edema is not due to cardiac failure, or fluid overload. There is impaired oxygenation. The ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) is ≤ 300 mmHg as assessed on 5 cm H2O of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Option D: Occult pneumothorax is a condition that is not suspected on the basis of the symptoms or plain radiography, but is detected with CT imaging. It usually follows a thoracic injury.",

      "question": "Detailed ExplanationsThe use of proton pump inhibitors is a risk factor for femoral neck fractures.Femoral neck fracture is a type of intracapsular hip fracture. Common risk factors for hipfractures include:• Increasing age• Female sex• White population of Europe and North America•SmokingDecreased level of physical activityComorbidities that can cause hip fractures are:•HIV• Celiac disease• Diabetes mellitus•Hypo and hyperthyroidism• Primary hyperparathyroidism•Chronic kidney and liver diseaseDrugs that can cause hip fractures are:• Corticosteroids•• Proton pump inhibitors•Antipsychotic medication• Aromatase inhibitors•Gonadotropin-releasing hormone inhibitors• Long-acting progesterone-only pillsSolution to Question 2:Neer's classification is used for proximal humeral fractures.Classifications used for neck of femur fracture are:161•Based on the location of the fracture line• Pauwels classification• Garden classification• Delbet classification (hip fractures in the pediatric population)Based on the location of the fracture line it can be classified as:•Sub-capital fracture at the junction of head and neck-• Transcervical fracture in the neck-• Basi-cervical - fracture at the base of the neckPauwels classification of fractureneck of femurReference lineFracturelineI stage<30°(30-50%50°Type IType IIType IIIOMARROWIncompletefracture lineGarden classification of fractureneck of femurII StageComplete fracture line;non displacedIII stageAREComplete fracture line;partially displaced(All three sets of trabeculaeare out of alignment)IV stageComplete fracture line;completely displaced(Trabeculae betweenacetabulum and headare realigned)OMARROWDelbet classification is used for hip fractures in children. They are grouped into four types basedon their location as follows:-• Type I Transepiphyseal fracture162• Type II - Transcervical fracture•-Type III Cervicotrochanteric fracture• Type IV - Intertrochanteric fractureSolution to Question 3:In Garden's stage III fracture neck of femur, all the 3 sets of trabeculae are out of alignment.Garden classification of fracture neck of femur is based on the degree of displacement.•Stage I incomplete fracture line and femoral head is in slight valgus•Stage II - complete fracture line and non-displaced•Stage III - complete fracture line and partially displacedStage IV complete fracture line and completely displacedGarden classification of fractureneck of femurI stageII StageIncompletefracture lineComplete fracture line;non displacedIII stageComplete fracture line;partially displaced(All three sets of trabeculaeare out of alignment)IV stageComplete fracture line;completely displaced(Trabeculae betweenacetabulum and headare realigned)OMARROWSolution to Question 4:The plane of reference in Pauwel's classification is the horizontal plane. This classification is basedon Pauwel's angle i.e. the angle made by the fracture line in reference to the horizontal plane.163Pauwels classification of fractureneck of femurReference lineFractureline<30°30-50%50°Type IType IIType IIIOMARROWWhen the Pauwel's angle is small, compressive forces act at the fracture ends and hence thefracture is stable. As Pauwel's angle increases, the fracture line becomes more vertical and theshearing forces act on the fractured ends. Hence, at higher angles the fracture becomes unstable.Solution to Question 5:The history of fall and hip injury in an elderly patient along with the radiological findings of abroken Shenton's line is suggestive of a neck of femur fracture. In this condition, the attitude ofthe leg will be shortened and externally rotated and movements of the hip joint will be painful.A plain radiograph may show the following features:• Fracture line in the neck of femur• External rotation of the femur with the lesser trochanter appearing more prominent•Displacement of the greater trochanter• Break in the trabecular stream•Break in Shenton's line164Shenton's line in fracture of neck of femurFracture neckof femurShenton's lineSolution to Question 6:The given scenario and X-ray are suggestive of right-sided fracture neck of femur, Garden stageIV. Since the patient is &gt;65 years with existing arthritis, the best choice of treatment is total hiparthroplasty.In the absence of arthritis, fracture neck of femur in patients &gt;65 years, is treated byhemiarthroplasty.The image given below shows total hip arthroplasty done for fracture neck of femur.aASolution to Question 7:165The most commonly used equipment for internal fixation of fracture neck of femur in youngadults is multiple cannulated cancellous screws.The radiograph given below shows internal fixation of the neck of femur fracture with cannulatedcancellous screws.R36bOption B: Dynamic hip screw is used in some cases of fracture neck of femur and for the internalfixation of the intertrochanteric fractures. The image below shows a dynamic hip screw.Option C: Austin Moore's implant is an older implant used in unipolar hemiarthroplasty.Option D: Herbert screw is used in bridging a scaphoid fracture.Solution to Question 8:166In the given clinical scenario with a 3-week old femoral head fracture, the next step will be todo an MRI hip. This is to evaluate the femoral head for compromise in the blood supply.Treatment of the femoral head fracture depends on the findings seen on an MRI:• Femoral head shows compromised blood supply - reduction with fibular bone graft or musclepedicle graft• Femoral head shows signs of osteonecrosis and acetabulum is normal - hemiarthroplasty• Femoral head is normal but the fracture is nearly vertical (can develop to non-union)- osteotomyThe image given below shows osteonecrosis of the femoral head seen on an MRI.Solution to Question 9:The given clinical scenario is suggestive of a 1-month-old Pauwel's type III fracture (&gt;50°),which is nearly vertical and has an increased chance of non-union. Hence, the best managementwould be to compress the fractured ends by Mc Murray's osteotomy and internal fixation.Solution to Question 10:In McMurray's osteotomy, the distal fragment is displaced medially and is abducted. This convertsshearing stresses at the fracture site to compressive forces promoting faster healing.McMurray's osteotomy is an oblique osteotomy directed medially upwards at theinter-trochanteric region. It is based on the biomechanical principle. After the medialdisplacement of the femur, the weight-bearing line passes from the head to the distal fragment. It,therefore, bypasses the fracture site.167McMurray's OsteotomyLine of weight-bearing.Distal fragment displacedmedially and abducted.OMARROWWeightSolution to Question 11:The given clinical scenario is suggestive of non-union of femoral neck fracture after ORIF, as thereis no evidence of healing 6-12 months post-operatively. Lack of cambium layer in the periosteumof neck of femur is one of the causes of non-union.Causes for non-union in the neck of femur fracture are as follows:•Inadequate blood supply of femoral head• Since the fracture is intra-articular, the synovial fluid interferes with fracture healing.•• Lack of the cambium layer of periosteum, which produces the callus• Inadequate reduction and poor internal fixation• Improper immobilizationThe image given below shows (",

Non-union is a complication of this fracture,not malunion.Malunion is a complication of inter-trochanteric fractures.Complications of fracture neck of the femur are:••• Avascular necrosis (most common)• Non-union• Osteonecrosis of the femoral head may lead to secondary osteoarthritis after many yearsOption B: In impacted fracture neck of femur, the patient may be able to walk.Option D: Shortening of the limb is less than 1 inch in fracture neck of femur.Solution to Question 13:Avascular necrosis is a late complication of fracture neck of the femur, which can be diagnosed onX-ray only after a few months to 2 years after the injury. Hence, MRI is the best investigation fordiagnosis.The amount of vascular damage produced at the time of fracture determines the probability of thedevelopment of osteonecrosis. In addition to this, the blood supply to the femoral head may alsobe disrupted during internal fixation. Hence, avascular necrosis can also occur in united femurfractures.More proximally the fracture is located, worse is the prognosis. Hence, sub-capital fractures havethe worst prognosis.169Patients with sickle cell disease are at an increased risk for developing avascular necrosis of thefemoral head.Solution to Question 14:The given clinical scenario with the limb shortening &gt;1 inch and pronounced externalrotation is suggestive of inter-trochanteric fracture of the femur.Differences between fracture neck of femur and inter-trochanteric fractures:Option B: In fracture neck of femur, the limb is in slight external rotation and shortening is &lt;1inch.Option C: In femoral shaft fractures, the limb is shortened with displaced proximal and distalfragments.Option D: In anterior dislocation of the hip, the limb is externally rotated. There may be a truelengthening of the limb with the femoral head palpable in the groin.FeatureAgeSexCommon in femalesInjuryTrivialAbility to walkMay walkFracture neck of femurMore than 50 yearsInter-trochanteric fractureMore than 60 yearsCommon in malesSignificantUnable to walkPainMildSwellingNilNilIn Scarpa's triangleEcchymosisTendernessExternal rotation deformity Less than 45 degreesShorteningTreatmentComplicationsLess than 1 inchInternal fixation alwaysAvascular necrosis and Non-unionSevereSeverePresentOn the greater trochanterMore than 45 degrees (Latera1 border of foot touches the be",
