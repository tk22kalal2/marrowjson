      "explanation": "The complaints of hip pain in an overweight man with a history of long-term steroid use alongwith the radiological findings of subchondral cysts and positive crescent sign in the femoral headare characteristic of osteonecrosis of the femoral head.Avascular necrosis or osteonecrosis is a painful bone condition that results from diminished bloodsupply mainly due to trauma or non-traumatic etiologies. Alcohol, corticosteroids,immunosuppressives, and cytotoxic drugs, either singly or in combination, are the most commoncauses of non-traumatic osteonecrosis. The typical features are pain with movements in or nearthe joint, click in the joint, joint stiffness, limping gait, and deformity. Restriction of movements isalso a feature of this condition.An x-ray shows reactive new bone formation, increased radiolucency in the subchondral bone,and a distorted articular surface. The crescent sign is a subchondral fracture overlying the necroticsegment of the femoral head seen on radiography. MRI is the investigation of choice in earlydisease. It allows the identification of AVN of the femoral head and also determines the exactstage and extent of the pathologic process.203Crescent signAvascular necrosis of femoral headManagement is based on Ficat and Arlet Classification:Other options:Option A: Tuberculosis of the hip is characterized by painful and restricted movements of the hip,especially at night.

It refersto retrocalcaneal exostosis formed at the posterosuperior aspect of the calcaneum.retrocalcaneal bursa usually protects the Achilles tendon from the calcaneal tuberosity. But inHaglund deformity, there is chronic inflammation of this retrocalcaneal bursa due to increased orrepetitive chafing between the tuberosity and Achilles tendon. Due to prolonged inflammation,degenerative changes occur and osteophytes form within the tendon leading to calcification at thesite of the tendon insertion. This leads to deformity and pain symptoms.Management is usually conservative, using a heel lift, silicone pads in closed shoes, iceapplication, anti-inflammatory drugs, and stretching exercises of the calf.The image below shows the Haglund deformity.206Haglund's deformityHaglund deformityMARetrocalcanealbursaBonyenlargement-OMARROWW",

Onthe contrary, the pain is relieved when the knee is laterally rotated and then extended. This isknown as Wilson's sign.In the initial stages, it is treated conservatively.

      "explanation": "A low Q angle is not a feature of chondromalacia patellae, on the contrary, it has a high Qangle (quadriceps angle).Q angle is the angle made by the line of the quadriceps pull with the patellar tendon. The line ofquadriceps pull extends from the middle of the patella to the anterior superior iliac spine. Normalrange is 14-17 degrees. An angle of more than 20 degrees predisposes to anterior knee pain.This condition is commonly seen in young women and athletes and is mainly caused due to themechanical overload of the patellofemoral joint.Patients commonly present with anterior knee pain. The pain is increased by climbing stairs andstanding after prolonged sitting. This is known as the theatre sign or movie sign (pain andstiffness after sitting for a long time in a theatre).It can also be associated with knee swelling and catching sensation (not true locking) of the kneejoint.It is treated conservatively by anti-inflammatory medications, avoiding stressful exercises, andphysiotherapy.208eQ-Angle or Quadriceps AngleAnterior SuperiorIliac Spine (ASIS)Q-angleMidpointof patellaTibial tubercleLine ASIS to midpoint of patellaLine Tibial tubercle to midpoint of patellaOMARROW",
