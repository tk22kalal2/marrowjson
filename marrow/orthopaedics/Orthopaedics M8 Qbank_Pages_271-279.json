      "explanation": "Isolated pubic diastasis is not a criterion for unstable pelvic injury. For the pubic diastasis to beconsidered unstable, it must be accompanied with posterior ring injury or injury of sacro-tuberousor sacro-spinous ligaments.Radiographic factors indicating unstable pelvic injury include:•Sacroiliac joint disruption &gt;1 cm.•• Gap in posterior pelvic ring.274•Avulsion fracture of L5 transverse process or sacrotuberous or sacrospinous ligament.• Pubic diastasis of &gt; 2 cm along with posterior ring injury or sacro-tuberous ligament orsacrospinous ligament.",

      "explanation": "Jumper's fracture is H or U-shaped fracture of the sacrum.These are called jumper's or suicide jumper's fracture as they are seen in falls from height. Thereare two longitudinal fractures that run through the sacral foramina and a transverse fracture. Thelevel of the transverse fracture line determines if it is H or U shaped.As these fractures pass through the sacral foramina, they can cause injury to the spinal cord andresult in cauda equina syndrome.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Acute haemorrhage leading to hypovolemic shock is the most common complication of pelvicfractures.In fractures of the pelvic ring, there is a risk of injury to the major vessels (internal iliac andexternal iliac vessels) and to the venous plexus around the sacroiliac joint. Bleeding from thevenous plexus is the major cause of pelvic haemorrhage.Potential blood loss in fractures is given below:Pelvic fractures have a high mortality rate ranging from 10% to 50% in some open pelvicfractures. Early mortality is mostly the result of haemorrhage. Late mortality occurs from sepsisor multiple system organ failure.Fracture sitePelvisPotential blood loss> 2 litresFemurTibia or fibul1 - 2 litres0.5 - 1.5 litresa",

      "question": "272An elderly man was accidentally dragged down the stairs when he was taking his dog for awalk. He is suspected to have sustained a pelvic fracture.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Closed degloving soft tissue injuries associated with pelvic and acetabular fractures are knownas Morel-Lavallee lesions.277Morel-Lavallee lesion involves separation of skin from the underlying fascia. They are frequentlyseen in pelvic fractures due to motor vehicle accidents and other crush injuries. The shearing forcein these injuries creates a pocket between skin and fascia where a considerable amount of bloodcan collect.MRI and ultrasonography are recommended to confirm the diagnosis.Complications of Morel-Lavallee lesions include infection, subcutaneous fat necrosis, and necrosisof the overlying skin. These lesions are managed through incisional drainage, debridement, andirrigation of the wound.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Spur sign is seen in bicolumnar acetabular fractures.Bicolumnar fractures cause disruption of both the anterior and posterior columns on theacetabulum. Due to the fracture in the acetabulum, the femoral head migrates medially. Theunsupported triangular area of the ilium is then seen laterally as the spur sign. It is best seen onobturator oblique view radiographs.The obturator oblique X-ray image of pelvis shows a comminuted left acetabular fracture affectingboth the columns (disruption of both the iliopectineal and ilioischial lines). The left ilium is seenpointing laterally (spur sign).Posterior wall fractures are the most common type of acetabular fractures. Letournel and Judetclassification is used to classify acetabular fractures.Judet view (45-degree oblique) and AP views are used to radiographically evaluate acetabularfractures.",
