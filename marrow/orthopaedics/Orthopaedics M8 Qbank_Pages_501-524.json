      "explanation": "The above radiograph shows a K-nail (Kuntscher nail), identified by the absence of interlockingscrews. A cloverleaf shape is seen on cross-section. This is designed to give a good rotationalstability.Kuntschers clover leaf nailMAOWOMARROWK-nails have been used for the internal fixation of femur fractures, and fixation relies on thefrictional fit between the nail and bone. It is based on the concept of three-point fixation i.e., atproximal and distal ends of the bone and at the isthmus (the narrowest part of the medullarycavity).The eye at the end of the nail is useful for removing it after the fracture has healed.Some common complications of K-nailing include:•The nail getting stuck•Splintering of the cortex while hammering the nail• Proximal migration of the nail, leading to bursitis over its protruding end•• Distal migration of the nail leading to stiffness of the knee510• Infection.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The above radiograph depicts the lengthening of the limb using Ilizarov apparatus. The rate ofcompression/distraction is 1 mm per day, not 2 mm per day.Ilizarov's technique is based on the principle of distraction osteogenesis. This is the mechanicalinduction of new bone which occurs between bony surfaces that are gradually pulled apart.Compression and distraction at the fracture site enhance osteogenesis.A careful fracture of the bone is performed, followed by a short wait. The young callus formed isgradually distracted using a circular or unilateral external fixator system called a ringfixator. Transfixing thin Kirschner wires (K-wires) are the key components of the Ilizarov fixatorregarding its axial stiffness. This affects the mechanobiological environment in which the boneheals.Distraction or compression can be applied by twisting nuts on the fixation system at the fractureor corticotomy site. Distraction or compression is carried out at the rate of 1 mm per day.The uses of Ilizarov's apparatus are as follows:• Limb lengthening• Non-union•Deformity correction•Osteomyelitis - as it offers the possibility of liberal excision of bone-• Arthrodesis crushing articular surfaces can stimulate union between opposing bonesDisadvantages of this technique include pin tract infection, nerve palsy, and joint stiffness.The below images show the Ilizarov apparatus and an illustration of distraction osteogenesis.513Distraction OsteogenesisMARROW",
