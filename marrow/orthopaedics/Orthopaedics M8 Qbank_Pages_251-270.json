      "explanation": "Type III spondylolisthesis is of degenerative origin and presents mostly during middle-age orlater. It occurs most commonly at the L4-L5 level.Wiltse-Newman classification of spondylolisthesis is based on the cause. It is as follows:• I (Dysplastic) - Congenital abnormalities of the lumbosacral junction⚫ II (Isthmic or lytic) - Due to defects in the pars interarticularis• III (Degenerative) - Degenerative changes in the disc and incompetence of facet joints•• IV (Traumatic) -Posterior arch fractures causing destabilization of the spine• V (Pathologic) - Due to destructive diseases such as tuberculosis or neoplasm259• VI (Iatrogenic) - After facetectomy surgery and pars fracture during laminectomiesTypes I and II are commonly seen in childhood and adolescence. These occur most commonly atthe L5-S1 level.",

      "explanation": "In the above clinical scenario, the patient most likely has spondylolisthesis. A palpable step in thelumbosacral spine is a classic clinical feature of this condition. It is known as step sign.260Normally, the spinous processes of the adjacent vertebrae are aligned with each other. They canbe palpated on the back in a smooth way.In spondylolisthesis, one vertebra has moved over the other. Therefore, a step-off or step sign canbe felt over the spinous process at the affected level.Note: The step-off sign is also used to describe the radiographic appearance of Lisfranc injury ofthe foot. There is a dorsal displacement of the tarsal bones with respect to the metatarsal bones.",

It disappearswhen the patient is made to bend forwards.Degenerative scoliosis occurs due to degeneration of the spine with ageing.",

Bragard test (sciatic stretch test or flip test):• Perform SLRT• When the patient experiences discomfort, the leg is lowered a little till the pain disappears• At this angle, the ankle is passively dorsiflexed•• If pain is felt again at the back of the thigh or in the calf, the test is positive•Also called reinforcement positive or Bragard's sign positive266Bragard's testROMARROW3.

Popliteal compression test or Bowstring sign:•Bowstring sign is more specific for disc prolapse than SLRT• Perform SLRT until the patient experiences sciatic pain•Without reducing the amount of lift, bend the knee to relax the sciatic nerve• Buttock pain is immediately relieved• The examiner then presses popliteal fossa to stretch the lateral popliteal nerve behind the lateraltibial condyle• Tightening of the nerve like a bowstring re-induces the pain267Popliteal Compression TestMARROWW5. Femoral stretch (reverse Lasegue test or Mackiewicz sign):• Patient lies prone•••Examiner flexes the knee and the hip is passively extendedTest is positive if patient experiences anterior thigh painThis test is usually positive for L2-L3 and L3-L4 (high lumbar) protrusionsFemoral stretch testOMARROW",
