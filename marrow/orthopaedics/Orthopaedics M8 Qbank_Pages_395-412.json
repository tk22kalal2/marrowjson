      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Methotrexate with anti-TNF is superior to any other treatment in limiting progression of jointdestruction and disability.407In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) joint inflammation is the main cause of joint damage and is the mostimportant factor of joint disability and deformities.Methotrexate belongs to the category of drugs known as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs(DMARDs). They slow down or prevent the structural progression of RA and hence are used inmost combination therapies. Among the DMARDs, methotrexate is the preferred first-line drug.Biologic DMARDs such as anti-TNF agents target cytokines and cell-surface molecules to slow theprogression of joint inflammation. These drugs are typically used in combination with backgroundmethotrexate therapy.Combination therapy with methotrexate and an anti-TNF drug is the most commonly used nextstep for the treatment of patients with deformities, having an inadequate response tomethotrexate therapy.Steroids are used when rapid control of the disease is required. They have a rapid onset of action,while the DMARDs take anywhere from 6-12 weeks to come into effect. They can be used as acover during this period. Steroids can also be used in short courses for acute flare-up episodes ofRA. Long-term use of steroids is not advised due to their adverse effects such as osteoporosis.They are usually not used alone (option A) but are used as an adjunct to DMARDs likemethotrexate (option B).Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used as adjunctive therapy for themanagement of uncontrollable symptoms because of their analgesic and anti-inflammatoryproperties. Chronic use is not advised due to their side effects namely gastritis and peptic ulcerdisease as well as impairment of renal function (option D)Hence, among the given options methotrexate with anti-TNF is the best therapy in a patient withdeformity.",
