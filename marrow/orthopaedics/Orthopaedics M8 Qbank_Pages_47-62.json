      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Elevated scapula is not a part of the clinical triad of Klippel-Feil syndrome. However, it is associated with Sprengel deformity, which occurs in approximately 30% of cases. The classic clinical triad seen in this condition includes: short neck, low posterior hairline, and limited range of neck motion. Klippel-Feil syndrome is a developmental disorder caused by a failure of normal segmentation of the cervical somites during the 3rd to 8th week of embryogenesis. This results in a congenital fusion of at least 2 cervical vertebrae, sometimes a block of cervical vertebrae, and rarely the entire cervical spine. X-rays may show the fusion of two or more cervical vertebrae. The vertebrae are also widened and flattened (wasp-waist appearance).",

      "explanation": "Most common skeletal anomaly associated with Klippel-Feil syndrome is scoliosis. Klippel-Feil syndrome is often associated with other skeletal and extraskeletal anomalies: Skeletal anomalies: scoliosis > Sprengel deformity > cervical ribs; Extraskeletal anomalies: renal abnormalities > deafness > congenital heart disease. Ventricular septal defect is the most common cardiovascular anomaly associated with this syndrome. Synkinesis (mirror movements) is involuntary paired movements of hands and arms seen in around 20% of children with Klippel-Feil syndrome. The child cannot move one hand without a similar reciprocal movement in the opposite hand.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The image shows an upward elevation of the scapula relative to the thoracic cage characteristically seen in Sprengel deformity. Sprengel deformity is a congenital upward elevation of the scapula. It is due to the failure of the scapula to descend completely in embryonic life. The affected scapula is smaller, shaped differently, abnormally high, and somewhat prominent. Shoulder movements are usually painless. Abduction and elevation of shoulders may be limited due to fixation of the scapula. The Cavendish classification is used to grade the severity of Sprengel deformity. If the deformity is mild, no treatment is required. In severe deformity, surgery may be indicated. These procedures include: • Green procedure • Woodward procedure • Mears procedure",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Dextrocardia is not associated with Sprengel deformity. Sprengel deformity is the congenital elevation of the scapula. It is characterized by an elevated shoulder on the affected side, with an abnormally high, smaller, and prominent scapula. The neck appears shorter, and there may be kyphosis or scoliosis of the upper thoracic spine. While shoulder movements are painless, abduction and elevation may be limited due to scapular fixation. Abnormalities associated with Sprengel deformity include: Klippel-Feil Syndrome, kyphosis or scoliosis, cervical rib, omovertebral bar (a bony bridge between the scapula and the cervical spine), spina bifida, diastematomyelia (congenitally split spinal cord), torticollis, and renal abnormalities.",

        "D": "Indentation of the skull floor by the cervical spine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Basilar impression (basilar invagination) is a deformity in which there is an indentation of the skull floor by the upper cervical spine. Basilar invagination is invagination (infolding) of the base of the skull that occurs when the top of the C2 vertebra migrates upward. It can cause narrowing of the foramen magnum (the opening in the skull where the spinal cord passes through to the brain). It also may press on the lower brainstem. Basilar impression can be primary (congenital) or secondary (acquired). Primary: Congenital defect in bone development at the craniocervical junction. The tip of the odontoid bone is more cranial than normal. Secondary: Acquired deformity due to systemic diseases that affect bony structures at the base of the skull. Neurologic symptoms are seen due to pressure on the brainstem, such as weakness and paresthesia in the limbs. There can be symptoms related to compression of cranial nerves (trigeminal, vagus, glossopharyngeal, hypoglossal) and the vertebral artery. Craniometric parameters used for diagnosis include McRae's line, Chamberlain's line, and McGregor's line. Treatment is by surgical decompression and stabilization with a posterior occipito-cervical arthrodesis. Odontoidectomy is done if compression is due to an aberrant odontoid. The image shows basilar invagination in an infant with indentation of the medulla oblongata by the odontoid process.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The test performed in the given video is Allen's test. Allen's test is mainly used to test the adequacy of ulnar collateral blood flow to the hand, which is usually done prior to radial artery cannulation. Procedure: • The radial and ulnar arteries are occluded as the patient makes a tight fist so as to exsanguinate the palm. • Then the patient is asked to open the hand and the occlusion over the ulnar artery is released. Ulnar artery released and the patient's ulnar artery is released, and not patent. Modified Allen's test: Clinched, blanched palm, Radial artery occluded, Radial artery occluded. Modified Allen's Test - Positive, Radial artery Occluded, Modified Allen's Test – Negative. Interpretation: • As occlusion of the ulnar artery is released, the color of the open palm is observed. Normally, the color will return to the palm within 5 - 6 seconds. • If the palm remains pale for more than 6-10 seconds, it indicates reduced ulnar collateral flow. • The modified Allen's test considers a threshold of 5 to 15 seconds. Clinical significance: • In recent years, studies have shown that, although the Allen test is often used to identify patients at increased risk for ischemic complications from radial artery cannulation, the predictive value of this test is poor. • It is also used for identifying patients acceptable for radial artery harvest or use for coronary angiography.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given X-ray shows a cervical rib on the left side. The cervical rib is an additional rib that arises from the 7th cervical vertebra. It may be a complete rib or incomplete and present for a short distance with the anterior part having a fibrous band. It is usually unilateral and more common on the right side. In most individuals with cervical rib, there are no symptoms. It is incidentally detected on radiographs. In a small proportion of individuals with cervical rib, it can cause symptoms of thoracic outlet obstruction due to pressure on the neurovascular structures. These symptoms manifest after the age of 30 years as the shoulders start to sag with increasing age. The absence of a rib on the X-ray does not rule out the possibility of a cervical rib. CT and MRI are more sensitive.",

Among the operations listed, posterior decompression is not a treatment option for cervical spondylosis. Cervical spondylosis is a disorder arising due to chronic intervertebral disc degeneration in the cervical region. Changes are most common in lower cervical segments such as C5/6 and C6/7. The most common clinical feature is pain and stiffness of the neck. The X-ray may show osteophytes and degenerative changes.

It is associated with various bone-forming conditions such as diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) and fluorosis. It is most commonly seen in the cervical spine. It can result in spinal stenosis and cervical myelopathy causing pain and weakness in the limbs. X-ray shows dense ossification along the back of the vertebral bodies in the mid-cervical spine.
