      "explanation": "Paget's disease is characterized by increased bone turnover with enlargement and thickening ofthe bone. It is also called osteitis deformans.It manifests in 4th and 5th-decade males.The pathologic process in Paget's disease is initiated by overactive osteoclastic boneresorption followed by a compensatory increase in osteoblastic new bone formation. This resultsin a structurally disorganized mosaic of woven and lamellar bone causing the bones tobe unusually brittle. Plasma alkaline phosphatase is increased due to the osteoblastic activity.",

It is characterised bynormal lamellar bone replaced with haphazard (woven) bone.In the final sclerotic phase, bone resorption declines progressively and leads to a hard, dense, lessvascular mosaic bone, which represents the so-called burned-out phase of Paget's disease.The arrow mark in the following image indicates blade of grass appearance.",

This leads to increased warmth over the limbs. Theymay also have kyphosis and bowing of legs. Increased bone formation in Paget's disease may leadto the narrowing of the foramina of the skull. This causes compression of the cranial nerves whichmay lead to deafness.Deafness due to the narrowing of cranial nerve foramina is also seen in osteopetrosis.

      "explanation": "The parathyroid hormone does not increase calcium absorption from the intestine directly.Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is produced by the parathyroid glands. It is regulated by the levels ofserum ionized calcium. It stimulates the enzyme 1α-hydroxylase which converts25-hydroxycholecalciferol to 1,25- dihydroxycholecalciferol (active form of vitamin D). It onlyincreases the formation of vitamin D which increases calcium absorption from intestine.390KidneyCalcium homeostasis↓ Ca2+ in plasmaParathyroid glands↑ Parathyroid hormoneBone↑ Ca2+reabsorption↑ PO4excretion1,25 (OH)2D3formationCa2+releasedPO4releasedUrinary Ca2+Gut↑ Ca2+absorptionRestoration of normalcalcium levels in plasmaMARROW↑ PlasmaCa2+",

The given clinical scenario is suggestive of renal osteodystrophy which is causedby hyperparathyroidism secondary to chronic renal disease.Rugger jersey appearance is seen due to osteosclerosis of the superior and inferior vertebralendplates.
