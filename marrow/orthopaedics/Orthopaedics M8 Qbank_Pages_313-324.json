      "explanation": "Most supracondylar fractures (98%) are extension-type injuries. They are usually caused by a fallonto an outstretched hand.Supracondylar humeral fractures are the most common type of pediatric elbow fracture. Theymost commonly lead to the following nerve injuries:•Extension-type: Anterior interosseous nerve•Flexion-type: Ulnar nerveAccording to the Gartland classification, there are 3 types of fractures:• Type I: Undisplaced• Type II: Some degree of displacement•Type III: Complete displacementThe following x-ray shows a type III supracondylar fracture of the humerus:318Supracondylar fracture of humerus",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "This clinical scenario with a pink and pulseless arm is suggestive of a supracondylar fracture withadequate perfusion. The treatment of choice is reduction and pinning, followed by observation.On the other hand, if there is poor perfusion due to vascular compromise, the affected arm is paleand cool to the touch. In this case, the urgent reduction must be performed in the operating room.After reduction, the vascular status of the hand is reassessed. If the hand remains pale,exploration of the brachial artery, the release of entrapped structures, and direct repair with veingrafting may be required.",

      "explanation": "The physeal injury depicted in the given diagram is classified as Salter-Harris type II.In a type II fracture, the fracture line passes through the metaphysis into the epiphysealplate. This results in a metaphyseal fragment called the Thurston-Holland fragment. Theepiphysis is spared.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The pointing index sign is seen in supracondylar fractures of the humerus.This finding occurs as a result of injury to the median nerve. It results in loss of function of bothflexor digitorum profundus (FDP) and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS).

      "explanation": "This clinical scenario is suggestive of battered baby syndrome.320Non-accidental trauma must be suspected when there are ecchymoses and fractures in variousstages of healing. This indicates that the trauma has occurred over a period of time. Metaphysealcorner or bucket handle fractures are typically seen on x-ray. Sub-epiphyseal micro-fracture is alsoa feature of child abuse that is seen on MRI.In such cases, a radiological assessment of the entire skeleton is indicated.
