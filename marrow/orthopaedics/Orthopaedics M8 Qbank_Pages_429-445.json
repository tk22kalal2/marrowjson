A neuroma may form following axonotmesis and neurotmesis. In neurotmesis, neuromadoes not bridge the break in continuity and is called end neuroma. In axonotmesis, the neuromaformed bridges the continuity and is called neuroma in continuity.Tinel's sign is used to assess nerve regeneration following injury. The nerve is percussed along itscourse to elicit a tingling sensation. The point of tingling marks the site of newly sprouting axons.",
