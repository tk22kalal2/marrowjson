      "explanation": "Degloving is the avulsion of skin and subcutaneous fat from the underlying fascia, muscle or bone.Degloving injuries can be open or closed. An example of open degloving injury is finger avulsioninjury with loss of skin. Closed degloving injuries result from shearing forces (e.g. motor vehiclecollisions).The extent of degloving injuries are often underappreciated and much of the skin may benon-viable. Disruption of perforating vascular and lymphatic vessels may result in a characteristichaemolymphatic collection between the fascial planes called a Morel-Lavallée lesion.Patterns of degloving injury:•Limited degloving with abrasion or avulsion• Non-circumferential degloving.Circumferential single plane degloving• Circumferential multiplanar deglovingAssessing the viability of degloved tissue can be difficult and may therefore require more than onesurgical exploration and debridement before definitive reconstruction. Non-viable skin may showfixed staining and thrombosis of subcutaneous veins. Most surgeons serially excise the deglovedskin until punctate dermal bleeding is seen from viable tissue.Intravenous fluorescein can help in delineating non-viable tissue, but it requires specialistequipment and there is a small risk of anaphylaxis. Indocyanine green has been found to have less539risk of allergy.Open degloving injuries are managed by reattaching the viable skin and grafting. Closed deglovinginjuries are managed by draining the accumulated fluid, removing the dead tissue andsclerotherapy. For severe, multiplanar degloving, amputation is done.The given image below shows a degloving injury of the lower limb:VERSAJET EXACT",

      "question": "Detailed ExplanationsPeripheral vascular disease is the most common cause of amputations.Amputation is defined as removal of the limb through a part of the bone. Disarticulation is theremoval of the limb through the joint.Causes of amputations can be classified into 3Ds:1. Dead•Peripheral vascular disease• Severe trauma• Burns• Frostbite2. Dangerous•Malignant tumour• Potentially lethal sepsis•⚫ Crush injury3. Damned nuisance• Severe pain• Gross malformation532• Recurrent sepsis• Severe loss of functionNote: In India, road traffic accidents (RTAs) are the top cause, while globally, peripheral vasculardiseases, often linked to diabetes, are more common. Overall, peripheral vascular disease occursmore frequently than RTAs worldwide, unless the question specifies the primary cause in India,which would be crush injuries from RTAs.Solution to Question 2:Transcutaneous oxygen tension values below 20 mmHg are an indication for amputation.Fulminant gas gangrene, ankle-brachial index &lt; 0.45, and severe peripheral vascular disease areindications for amputation.Transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurement is believed to be the most reliable and sensitivetest for wound healing. The pressure may be falsely low in areas of edema, cellulitis, and venousstasis changes.Solution to Question 3:Mangled Extremity Severity Score (MESS) score can be used to decide between amputation andlimb salvage in crushing injuries.Components of MESS are:• Shock• Ischemia•Velocity• AgeTotal score is 11.
