      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "An abrasion is the most superficial of injuries and is one that does not penetrate the full thickness of the epidermis. Thus, the pure abrasion does not bleed, as blood vessels are confined to the dermis. The dermal papillae are corrugated in nature. Therefore, many abrasions enter the dermis, and bleeding commonly occurs. Abrasions are commonly known as grazes or scratches.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In an abrasion caused by a tangential force, the direction of the force is determined by epidermal tags. Abrasions caused by a tangential force are known as 'brush abrasions' or 'grazes' or 'brush burns.' They are commonly seen when a body is dragged over a rough surface, such as a road. This scrapes linear furrows across the skin. The epidermal tags raised by the impact tend to pile up at the distal end. The method of formation of epidermal tags is given in the image below. Terminal epidermal tag, tags direct the impact. Option A: Fishtailing is the shape of the stab wound caused by a single-edged weapon. Option C: Tailing of the wound indicates the direction of injury in incised wounds. Option D: Crushed hair follicles are seen at the edge of the wound in a laceration.",

        "D": "Postmortem wound - no vital reaction"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Postmortem wounds show no/absent vital reaction because no enzyme activity will be found in a wound sustained after death. This is not the same as a negative vital reaction, as it is indicative of decreased enzymatic activity and is seen in antemortem wounds. Vital reactions are local tissue reactions at the site of tissue damage. Only antemortem wounds show vital reactions, as cells are active at the time of wound infliction. The vital reactions of an antemortem wound are of two zones: \n   • Negative vital reaction (decrease in enzymatic activity of wound): It occurs in the central necrotic area, close to the edge of the wound, where there is irreversible damage to tissues.\n   • Positive vital reaction (increase in enzymatic activity of wound): It occurs just outside the necrotic area of the wound in order to salvage damaged (but not irreversibly damaged) tissues.\n   Difference between antemortem and postmortem wounds:\n   Trait: Site, Colour, Exudation, Microscopic\n   Antemortem wounds: Anywhere on the body, Bright reddish brown, More, Intravital reaction and congestion seen\n   Postmortem wounds: Usually over bony prominence, Yellowish, translucent, Parchment-like, Less, No intravital reaction and congestion\n   Vital reaction in antemortem and postmortem wounds: \n   Normal enzyme activity, Wound, Zone of positive vital reaction, Zone of negative vital reaction, No vital reaction\n   Normal enzyme activity, Antemortem, Postmortem",

      "options": {
        "A": "They lie underneath an intact epidermis",

        "C": "Blood commonly collects in the subcutaneous layer",
        "D": "It may become visible 1-2 days after the traumatic incident"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Contusions/bruises are caused by damage to veins, venules, and small arteries. Capillary bleeding would not be visible to the naked eye. A pure bruise lies beneath an intact epidermis. There is an extravascular collection of blood that has leaked from blood vessels damaged by mechanical impact. The usual bruise from a blunt impact is situated in the subcutaneous tissues, often in the fat layer. Obese people tend to bruise more easily due to the greater volume of subcutaneous tissue. Delayed bruising refers to bruises that become more prominent with the passage of hours or days. This is caused by the percolation of blood from deeper tissues upwards towards the epidermis. It is also partly due to continued bleeding from the ruptured vessels.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The shins are particularly prone to bruising with blunt trauma. Resilient areas, such as the abdominal wall and buttocks, bruise less with a given impact. The head, chest, and shins are more prone to bruising. This is because these regions have underlying bone and less subcutaneous tissue.",

      "question": "The police brought a victim of alleged domestic violence with a big bruise for evaluation. She claimed that it was inflicted by her husband three days ago, after which he had gone out of town. Which of the following is correct while determining the age of this injury?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Histological examination is the most reliable method",
        "B": "The appearance of green colour is the most significant change",
        "C": "Perl's reaction is the most useful criterion",
        "D": "Bright yellow colour indicates that it is less than 18 hours old"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The most useful criterion for dating a bruise is Perl's reaction for detecting haemosiderin. It becomes positive about 24-90 hours after infliction. Sometimes, there can be an earlier appearance, even down to 12 hours. Color changes in a bruise cannot be reliably used to estimate the age of a bruise. The most significant change is the appearance of a yellow color. This indicates that the bruise is more than 18 hours old. Histological examination is unreliable in the accurate dating of bruises.",

        "A": "2 weeks old",
        "B": "1-3 days old",
        "C": "7-12 days old",
        "D": "4-5 days old"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The bruise in the given image has a yellow appearance, which is attributed to the presence of bilirubin. This finding makes the bruise about 7-12 days old. Bruises are mechanical injuries that are characterized by the extravasation of blood into subcutaneous or subepithelial tissue spaces. The continuity of the overlying skin is preserved. These injuries are typical consequences of blunt force trauma. The extravasated blood serves as a sign of inflammation to attract macrophages, which degrade the hemoglobin into various compounds (hemosiderin, haematoidin, and bilirubin). This gives rise to shifting color changes that begin at the wound's periphery and migrate towards the center as time goes on.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Bruising on the neck may indicate a jaw fracture",
        "B": "Bruising at the nape of the neck indicates a fracture of the posterior cranial fossa",
        "C": "A black eye may be from a fracture of the anterior cranial fossa",
        "D": "Bruising behind the ear indicates a fracture of the middle cranial fossa"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Bruising at the nape of the neck does not indicate a fracture of the posterior cranial fossa. Ectopic bruises are also called migratory or percolated bruising. They are found at a different location than the actual site of injury. They are caused by the percolation of blood in the subcutaneous tissue from one site to another. Examples are: a black eye, which may be due to actual trauma to the eye, or maybe an ectopic bruise, and it may be from trauma to the forehead or from a fracture of the anterior cranial fossa. Battle sign, which is bruising seen over the mastoid process, is from a fracture of the middle cranial fossa. Bruising on the neck may indicate a jaw fracture.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given image shows postmortem hypostasis. The classic test used to differentiate a bruise from hypostasis is the incision test. The suspected area is incised to see if the underlying blood is intravascular (hypostasis) or infiltrating the tissues outside the vessels (contusion). Option A: Gettler's chloride test is used to differentiate between freshwater and saltwater drowning. It is not widely used now. Option C: In the precipitin test, a specific antiserum is made to react with the seminal fluid, blood, or saliva. A positive test will confirm human origin. Option D: Breslau's second life test is done to determine whether a child was born alive or not.",

        "D": "Double-edged knife"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The image shows 'tram-line' bruising. It would have most likely been produced by a stick or an iron rod. It occurs when the skin surface is struck by a rod or rectangular-sectioned object. The weapon sinks into the skin on impact. This causes the edges to drag the skin downwards, and the traction tears the marginal blood vessels. The centre compresses the skin, causing little or no damage to the vessels in the absence of underlying bone.",

        "C": "Uncalcified cartilage",
        "D": "Skin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The tissue most resistant to knife penetration is the skin, apart from bone or calcified cartilage. When a knife-point impacts against the skin, the latter dimples and resists. The tension developed in the stretched skin appears to act as an elastic reservoir, and when the threshold of resistance is exceeded, penetration suddenly occurs. Muscle offers little resistance to penetration. Uncalcified cartilage and subcutaneous tissue are easily penetrated by a sharp knife.",

      "options": {
        "A": "If the knife tapers beyond the point to which it was driven into the wound",
        "B": "If the knife was driven up to the hilt into the wound",
        "C": "If the weapon was moved after insertion",
        "D": "If the wound is parallel to the Langer lines"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "If the wound is parallel to the Langer lines, it would appear normal. In contrast to a wound that is perpendicular to the Langer lines, which would be longer than normal. This is because such wounds tend to gape more, giving a false interpretation of the weapon. Option A: The taper of the blade is related to wound size. The length of the wound would be equal to the width of the blade at the point to which it was inserted. Thus, the length of the wound varies according to the depth to which it was inserted. Once the blade edges become parallel, the wound size remains constant for further penetration of the knife. Option B: If a knife is driven up to the hilt, the depth of the wound as measured at autopsy may be greater than the true length of the blade. This is usually seen in the abdomen, and to a lesser extent in the chest. A forceful stab can cause the abdominal or chest wall to indent, allowing the knife tip to reach tissues that would normally be beyond its reach. Option C: If the weapon is moved after insertion, it distorts wound characteristics.",

      "explanation": "Sharp linear injury in the underlying bone suggests an incised wound, rather than a split laceration. An incised wound is a clean-cut wound caused by a sharp-cutting instrument. A split laceration is a type of laceration that usually occurs in areas where the skin overlies bone. An example of such an area is the scalp. Split lacerations can resemble incised wounds. A laceration can be distinguished from an incised wound by: • Bruising and crushing of the margins • Persistence of tissue strands across the interior of the wound, including fascial bands, vessels, and nerves • Absence of a sharply linear injury in the underlying bone • In areas covered by hair, as on the scalp, intact hairs will cross the wound.
