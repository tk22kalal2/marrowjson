      "explanation": "The skull of Indians can be classified as mesocephalic. This type of skull is of intermediate length and width. The skull of an Indian is Caucasian with a few Negroid characteristics. Because of racial mixing, the Indian skull cannot be correctly differentiated into the broad categories of dolichocephalic, mesocephalic, and brachycephalic. Note: This is a controversial question. The use of the cephalic index for the determination of race has been discredited and the cephalic index of the entire Indian population cannot be generalized to belong to one category. But the best answer to this question is mesocephalic. Type of skull: Cephalic index: Race. Dolichocephalic: 70-74.9: Europeans, Aborigines, Negros. Mesocephalic: 75-79.9: Pure Aryans, Aborigines, Europeans, Chinese, Indians. Brachycephalic: 80-84.9: Mongolians.",

      "explanation": "The cusps of molars are wide and deep, and the cusps of incisors are shovel-shaped in Mongoloid races. Africanoid races tend to have large teeth and often have more cusps on their molars, even up to eight, with two lingual cusps on the mandibular first premolars as an additional common finding. In Caucasian races, the lateral incisors in the upper jaw are usually smaller than the central. They also have long, pointed canine roots. Small nodules on the lingual surface of maxillary molars, called Carabelli's cusp, are most common in Caucasian races. In Mongoloid teeth, enamel pearls and small nodules of enamel on the tooth surface are much more frequent. The condition of bull-tooth or taurodontism is most common in Mongoloid people. The pulp cavity of molars is wide and deep, and the roots are fused and bent. A congenital lack of the third upper molar is most commonly seen. The lingual and labial ridges are more prominent.",

Barr bodies are seen in 0-4% of genetic males (46,XY) and 20-80% of genetic females (46,XX). Sites for sampling for sex chromatin include buccal mucosa, tooth pulp, and hair bulb.

Stature/femur relationship - The relationship between the mean stature and the mean length of the femur appears to be fairly stable around the world, which is 3.74. 4.

According to the rule, • Age in months = Square root of crown-heel length (when the crown-heel length is 25 cm or less/first 5 months). Age in months = crown-heel length divided by 5 (when the crown-heel length is more than 25 cm/last 5 months). Here, crown heel length = Crown rump + lower limb length = 31 cm.
