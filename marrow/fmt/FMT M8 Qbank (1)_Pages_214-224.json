      "question": "A 30-year-old fisherman was brought in dead. His autopsy findings revealed emphysema aquosum. What is the most probable cause of death?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Wet drowning",
        "B": "Shallow-water drowning",
        "C": "Immersion syndrome",
        "D": "Secondary drowning"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Emphysema aquosum is seen in cases of wet drowning. Overinflation of the lungs in drowning is known as emphysema aquosum. It is one of the most valuable positive signs of drowning. The edema fluid in the bronchi blocks the passive collapse that normally occurs at death. Hence, the lungs are held in the inspiratory position. The impression of the ribs on this overinflated lung leaves visible and palpable grooves on the lateral surface. Autopsy findings in drowning: \n      • Froth in the air passages - most useful autopsy sign in drowning. It consists of a proteinaceous exudate and surfactant mixed with the water of the drowning medium.\n      • Waterlogging of the lung - frothy fluid will exude from the bronchi when the lung is squeezed and from the cut surfaces when they are sectioned with a knife. But, the absence of waterlogging by no means excludes true drowning (e.g., dry drowning).\n      • Emphysema aquosum - overinflation of the lungs\n      • Paltauf's spots - subpleural hemorrhages that reflect hemolysis within intra-alveolar hemorrhages\n      • Dilation of the right heart and great veins - subjective and non-specific finding\n      • Foreign material in the stomach - watery fluid or even foreign material from the water, such as silt, weed, or sand\n      • Hemorrhage into the middle ears and into the temporal bone - a positive non-specific sign of drowning\n      • Presence of fluid in the middle ear or paranasal sinuses - not a reliable diagnostic sign of drowning\n   Note: The autopsy findings in drowning are mostly non-specific and none give conclusive evidence of drowning. The most useful one is froth in the air passages.",

      "question": "On examining a case of wet drowning, you observe weights that are attached to the body to keep it underwater. What does this suggest?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Homicidal drowning",
        "B": "Suicidal drowning",
        "C": "Can be either homicidal or suicidal",
        "D": "Accidental drowning"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Attachment of weights to the body to keep it underwater is consistent with both homicidal and suicidal drowning. Differentiating points: • Suicidal drowning - a determined suicidal person may attach weights to the body or tie his limbs. It is common among women. • Homicidal drowning - the following additional features may point to a homicidal drowning: • Constriction/marks around the neck may be present • Evidence of struggle at the banks of the river from where the body was recovered • Articles belonging to someone other than the deceased found on the banks of the river associated with those belonging to the deceased. Accidental drowning is the most common form of drowning. It is seen among fishermen, bathers, dock workers, intoxicated, and epileptics. Homicidal drowning is the least common.",

        "D": "Pulmonary edema and cardiac arrest"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Pulmonary edema and cardiac arrest cause death in a case of typical drowning. Death in other types of drowning can be due to: • Dry drowning - laryngeal spasm due to inrush of water • Near drowning - Hypoxemia leading to sepsis, electrolyte imbalances, pulmonary edema, and cerebral edema • Immersion syndrome - vagal inhibition causing cardiac arrest",

      "question": "A 45-year-old man drowns while on an arctic cruise by accidentally falling overboard with a horizontal entry into the sea. Which of the following is the most likely cause of death for this individual?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Cerebral edema",
        "B": "Pulmonary edema and heart failure",
        "C": "Vasovagal inhibition",
        "D": "Laryngeal spasm"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of immersion syndrome/hydrocution/submersion inhibition. Death results from cardiac arrest due to vasovagal inhibition followed by cardiac arrest. Vagal stimulation occurs due to: \n      • Stimulation of nerve endings on the surface of the body by cold water\n      • Falling or diving into the water in a manner so that it suddenly strikes the abdomen, especially the epigastric region.\n      • Stimulation of the nerve endings of the mucosa by the entry of cold water into the eardrums, nasal passages, the pharynx, and the larynx.\n   The mechanism involved in immersion syndrome:\n      • Diving/falling into the water, feet-first. Inexperienced 'duck-diving'. Diving/falling into the water with a horizontal entry\n      • People under the influence of alcohol are more likely affected due to the general vasodilation of skin vessels, consequently amplifying the effects of vasovagal inhibition. These effects are increased in people who are attempting suicide/anxious as they have a more active reflex arc.\n   Option A: Cerebral edema is seen in cases of near-drowning. It is a type of atypical drowning and is also known as post-immersion syndrome or secondary drowning. This type is necessitated by the survival of the drowning victim beyond 24 hours of a submersion episode. Death is due to respiratory decompensation suffered despite responding well to initial resuscitation measures. Mechanisms of death involve hypoxemia, which results in sepsis, electrolyte imbalances, pulmonary edema, and cerebral edema.\n   Option B: Pulmonary edema and cardiac arrest are the cause of death in typical drowning/primary drowning due to inhalation of water into the lungs. There are varying mechanisms for freshwater and saltwater drowning leading to either ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest, respectively. Both types of typical drowning have terminal pulmonary edema and heart failure as mechanisms of death.\n   Option D: In dry drowning, death is due to the development of laryngeal spasm and subsequent airway closure. Thick mucus, foam, and froth may develop, producing a plug.",

      "question": "A dead body of a man was retrieved from a lake. Which of the following electrolyte abnormalities would you expect in him?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Hyponatremia and hypokalemia",
        "B": "Hypernatremia and hyperkalemia",
        "C": "Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia",
        "D": "Hypernatremia and hypokalemia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Freshwater drowning (drowning in a lake) is associated with both hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. When freshwater (hypotonic to plasma) enters the alveolar spaces, it is rapidly absorbed into the pulmonary circulation, resulting in gross local hemodilution. This massive increase in blood volume leads to hemolysis with the liberation of potassium. This causes hyperkalemia with corresponding hyponatremia. When seawater enters, due to its high saline content, reverse osmotic flow occurs. The fluid leaves the circulation and enters the alveolar spaces. This causes hemoconcentration, hypernatremia, and pulmonary edema.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Gettler's test measures the chloride content of the left and right sides of the heart. A difference of 25 mg% in chloride concentrations between the two sides of the heart is an indication of death due to drowning. This test was used to identify the cause of drowning. Freshwater drowning - chloride content of the left heart is lower than that of the right heart. Saltwater drowning - chloride content of the right heart is lower than that of the left heart. Gettler's claims have been refuted and the test is no longer accepted.",

      "options": {
        "A": "This finding indicates that the person drowned within the last few hours",
        "B": "This change occurs faster in warm water than cold water",
        "C": "The changes in this finding first affect the back of the hand",
        "D": "It is also known as cutis anserina"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The image given shows the skin maceration or washerwoman's skin. It occurs faster in warm water than in cold water. The signs of immersion are: 1. Maceration of skin/washerwoman's skin. It begins within minutes in warm water and takes longer in cold water. It refers to the wrinkled, pale, and soaked appearance of the skin when immersed in water. This first appears on areas with an appreciable keratin layer such as the fingertips, palms, backs of the hands, and later the soles. The first site affected is the finger pads. It affects the hands earlier than the feet. The image given below shows skin maceration. Skin Maceration. 2. Cutis anserina - 'goose-flesh' or piloerection: This is usually found in cold water. The image given below shows cutis anserina. Cutis Anserina. 3. Post-mortem hypostasis - If the water is still, the postmortem hypostasis affects the head and limbs. This is because the chest and abdomen float higher because of the lungs and the abdominal gases. 4. Foreign bodies in respiratory passages and stomach - Sand may be found deep in the respiratory passages and stomach, especially if the body has been rolled by the waves on a beach. This is not evidence of live aspiration. The signs of immersion just indicate that the body was immersed in water. They are not evidence of death from drowning. In temperate climates, the following is an approximate guide to estimate the duration of immersion: Finding: No wrinkling of finger pads, Wrinkled fingers, palms, and feet, Early decomposition (Head and abdomen), Marbling of veins, peeling of the epidermis. Time since immersion: Less than a few hours, Few hours to 3 days, 4-10 days, 2-4 weeks. Muscle loss with bone exposure: 1-2 months.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Cadaveric spasm is an important sign of antemortem drowning. It manifests as closed hands with firmly grasped weed, grass, sticks, etc., floating in the water. When present, it is an important sign suggesting that the victim struggled for existence while in the water. The image given below shows a cadaveric spasm of the hand, holding grass, as seen in antemortem drowning.",

      "explanation": "The given image shows a diatom. Postmortem drowning does not show diatoms in the brain tissue. Diatoms are microscopic unicellular or colonial algae present in water. As the diatoms are found in both seawater and freshwater, their presence cannot differentiate between freshwater and seawater drowning. The presence of diatoms in the brain tissue is suggestive of antemortem drowning, as only a living person can transport diatoms from the lungs to the viscera via circulation.",
