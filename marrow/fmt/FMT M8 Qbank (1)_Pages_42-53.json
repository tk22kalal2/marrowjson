      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Fingerprint patterns are determined by the 4th month of gestation and remain fixed throughout life. Fingerprints are impressions of patterns that are formed by papillary or epidermal ridges at the fingertips. They begin to appear between 12-16 weeks of intrauterine life. The formation is completed by 24 weeks. At birth, a fine pattern of ridges is seen on the skin of the bulbs of the fingers and thumbs, parts of the palms, and the soles of the feet.",

        "C": "Plain arch",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Plain arches have no delta. Classification of fingerprints into different patterns is based on delta and core formation. Delta is a triangular arrangement formed where three separate ridge line flows come together. Core is the centermost portion of a ridge flow pattern. The number of delta and core for each pattern is given below. The image given below shows the delta and core in the different fingerprint patterns. For each type, the position of the core is marked with a green circle, and the delta is marked with a blue triangle. Pattern Loop Delta 1 Plain arch 0 Core 1 0 Tented arch 1 delta at the base of the upthrust Whorl 2 Accident >2 Types of fingerprints Plain arch Tented arch Right loop Left loop Whorl Note: Dactylography or dermatoglyphics is the study of fingerprint patterns. The first fingerprint bureau in India was established in Kolkata.",

        "D": "1, 2 and 3"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Latent prints can be made visible by ultraviolet spectrum lighting, application of lead powder and cyanoacrylate fuming. Latent prints are those that are left behind through interaction of hands, palms, and feet with the environment. Occasionally these prints are left cleanly so as to be clearly visible to the unaided eye. It is more often the case that the prints are only partially visible or not visible at all without the use of specialized fingerprint-processing methods and equipment. Methods to enhance fingerprints: • Lighting or photoluminescence • Ultraviolet spectrum • White light • Physical method - dusting a surface with a fine powder of contrasting color such as: • White: Lead carbonate • Black: Charcoal • Grey: Aluminium dust or chalk powder + mercury • Chemical • Ninhydrin • Cyanoacrylate fuming • Silver nitrate",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Histological sections up to a depth of 0.6 mm from the surface of the skin give satisfactory fingerprints. Since the ridges extend up to the dermis, fingerprints can be obtained from the dermis as well.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Fingerprint pattern differs in identical twins. Fingerprints are formed during intrauterine life due to friction ridges. These ridges are created by pressure on the fingers from touching the surroundings. Hence, it is unique to every individual.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "A person suffering from dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis (DPR) has a lack of fingerprint patterns, and hence will not leave fingerprint marks. There are two closely related autosomal dominant ectodermal dysplasia syndromes causing complete absence of fingerprints. They are Naegeli-Franceschetti-Jadassohn syndrome (NFJS) and dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis (DPR). A permanent damage of fingerprints also occurs in patients with leprosy, electrical injury, and irradiation.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Edgeoscopy is a method of identification through the examination of the unique details and characteristics found along the edges of individual fingerprint ridges. Methods of identification using different prints: • Dactylography - evaluation of fingerprints • Poroscopy - evaluation of sweat pore openings on fingerprint ridges • Cheiloscopy - evaluation of lip prints • Podography - evaluation of foot prints • Rugoscopy - evaluation of palatal rugae • Ridgeology - evaluation of friction ridges on fingerprints. Note: Locard is known as the father of poroscopy, edgeoscopy, and ridgeology.",

      "question": "A person of interest in a homicide case is on the run from the police. He wishes to remove the tattoo on his left arm which is very prominent. Which of the following methods may be used for the same?",
      "options": {
        "A": "1, 2, 3 and 4",

        "D": "1, 2, 3 and 5"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Methods for deliberate tattoo removal include: •Surgical excision• Scarification with sandpaper•Application of caustic soda•Electrolysis•Q-switch laser method - non-invasive and effective method for removing tattoos without scarring. All other methods depend upon damage to the epidermis and dermis, with consequent inflammation and scar formation. The tattoo is removed but replaced with a cicatrix, which will itself indicate that something pre-existed at that site. Attempts at the deliberate removal of tattoos are common to remove evidence of identity. Note: If the tattoo mark is absolutely invisible or has been removed artificially, the pigments used to produce them may be detected by histological examination of the lymph node.",

      "question": "In tattoos, which of the following colors is least likely to fade over time?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Red",
        "B": "Green",
        "C": "Black",
        "D": "Purple"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Black areas in a tattoo are the least likely to fade over years. This is because the black pigment (carbon particles) is more resistant than the other pigments to transportation by the lymphatic system. Thus, they tend to persist in the skin. Colors such as blue, green, or red are scavenged by tissue cells and leached into the lymphatic system after a number of years or decades. Light colors such as white, pink, and blue fade faster. Chemicals used in different tattoo pigments are: • Black pigment - Carbon • Green pigment - Potassium dichromate • Red pigment - Mercuric chloride. If the tattoo mark is absolutely invisible or has been removed artificially, the pigments used to produce them may be detected by histological examination of the lymph node.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Ink blotting is not used to visualize tattoos. A faded tattoo mark can be visualized by: Ultraviolet light, Infrared photography, Rubbing the part and examining it with a magnifying lens. In decomposed bodies, the tattoo marks can be visualized by removing the epidermis with a moist cloth. The lymph nodes near a tattoo mark also show a deposit of the pigment.",

      "question": "A deceased male was brought to the morgue for a post-mortem examination. His relatives reported that he had a tattoo on his skin, which was not found on examination. Which of the following structures would you examine?",

        "A": "Lymph nodes",
        "B": "Liver",
        "C": "Arteries",
        "D": "Skin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The lymph nodes should be examined in this case. Some amount of material or dye used for creating tattoo marks is transported through lymph to the regional lymph nodes. Hence, in cases where a tattoo mark has disappeared naturally or has been removed, the lymph nodes must be examined.",

        "D": "Hair scales have a coronal pattern"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The cuticle completely covers the hair shaft in human hair. It only partly covers the hair shaft in animal hair. Human hair has 3 parts: - Cuticle: outermost layer, - Cortex: middle layer, - Medulla: innermost part. Human hair can be identified by the following features: Thick cortex, i.e., medullary index < 0.3, Pigment present only in cortex, where it is evenly distributed, Pattern of scales are imbricate or flattened. Note: Medullary index = diameter of medulla / diameter of hair.",
