      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Death from poison hemlock (Conium maculatum) occurs due to the overstimulation of nicotinic receptors. All parts of poison hemlock contain coniine and similar alkaloids that are structurally and functionally analogous to nicotine. The mechanism of poisoning is two-fold: \n   • Non-depolarizing muscle blockade at the neuromuscular junction leading to flaccid paralysis and respiratory paralysis.\n   • Initial overstimulation followed by rapid depression by the nicotinic receptors. \n   These cause symptoms such as salivation, mydriasis, initial tachycardia followed by bradycardia, coma, and death. Typically, ingestion of poison hemlock is due to misidentification because of its similarity in appearance to wild carrots.",

The following are considered cardiac poisons: • Digitalis purpurea - contains digitoxin, digitalin, digitonin, and digoxin • Nerium odorum (Oleander) - contains oleandroside (oleandrin) and nerioside (nerin), which resemble digitalis in action • Cerbera thevetia (yellow oleander) - contains thevetin and thevetoxin, similar to digitalis in action • Cerbera odollam - closely related to Cerbera thevetia • Aconite: Aconitine is the major component • Quinine • Nicotine",

      "explanation": "The image shows roots resembling horseradish, suggestive of the aconite plant. Hippus is associated with aconite poisoning. Hippus is an abnormal exaggeration of the rhythmic contraction and dilatation of the pupil, independent of changes in illumination or in fixation of the eyes. Poisoning with aconite has never been common. Most reported cases are accidental in nature, resulting from therapeutic misadventures. Aconite is used in herbal medicines, or to increase the intoxicating effect of alcoholic beverages. Option B: Hunan hand is due to Capsicum annum. Dermatitis and burning of hands and fingers, known as Hunan hand, is common among the pickle industry workers, who use their hands for handling chilly paste or powder for a prolonged period. Option C: Jamaican vomiting sickness is a syndrome characterized by vomiting and hypoglycemia, seen in the ingestion of the unripe ackee fruit. Option D: St Anthony's fire is the burning pain seen in gangrene caused by ergot poisoning.",

Medicolegal importance - It is a commonly used cattle poison in Indian villages by injecting the seed extract into the animal in the form of certain fine needle-shaped structures known as sui (meaning needle in Hindi). These are prepared by mixing the seed extract with opium, datura, and spirit/water and then blended into a paste, shaped into fine needles, dried in the sun, and used to kill cattle by driving it deep into the animal body by blowing through a hollow bamboo pipe.",

It is a competitiveantagonist of glycine at the postsynaptic receptors in the motor neurons of the anterior horn ofthe spinal cord. This leads to increased activity in the motor neurons.The fatal dose is 15-30 mg of strychnine or one crushed seed. If death is preceded by a severeconvulsion, as in strychnine poisoning, it causes an increase in the body temperaturecalled postmortem caloricity.The toxin strychnine does not affect any receptors in the brain and the person remains conscioustill death. Strychnine poisoning is characterized by conscious seizures.",

The roots are the most poisonous part of theplant and are mistaken for horseradish root.The toxic principle is aconitine. It acts on the voltage-sensitive sodium channels of the cellmembranes of excitable tissues. Aconitine first stimulates and then paralyzes the peripheralterminations of sensory and secretory nerves, CNS, and nerves of the myocardium, skeletal andsmooth muscles.Patients present mainly with a combination of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and neurologicalfeatures. Numbness and tingling are characteristic features. The fatal period is 2-6 hours.Aconite is commonly used for homicidal poisoning because:•Cheap and easily available• Short fatal period• Extremely unstable and destroyed by putrefaction",

      "explanation": "Constriction bands may be useful, especially when immediate medical care is not available. A constriction band is an elastic bandage or Penrose drain, thick rope, or piece of clothing wrapped circumferentially above the bite. It is applied with enough tension to restrict superficial venous and lymphatic flow while maintaining distal pulses and capillary filling. Measures that can be done in the case of snakebite: \n      • Apply firm pressure over the bitten area, which delays absorption of venom \n      • Pressure immobilization is recommended for elapid and sea-snake bites, but not for viper bites as it may cause local necrosis \n      • Clean the wound with soap and water, or iodine and cover with a sterile dressing \n      • Immediately apply a broad firm bandage (Sutherland wrap) on the bitten area and around the limb. As much of the limb should be bandaged as is possible. It should be tight enough to occlude the superficial venous and lymphatic return, but not the arterial or deep venous flow. A pressure of 50 to 70 mm Hg is maintained \n      • In bites on the trunk, head, or neck, apply firm pressure over the bitten area \n      • Immobilize the limb, as movement can accelerate the spread of venom \n      • Make the patient lie on one side in the recovery position so that the airway is clear, in case of vomiting or fainting \n   Measures contraindicated in the case of snakebite: \n      • Suction and incision of the wound \n      • Electric shock treatment of wound site \n      • Application of tourniquets because they obstruct arterial flow and cause ischemia \n      • Ice water immersion of the bitten limb",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The given scenario with the persistent erection of the penis for &gt; 4 hours is indicativeof priapism. It can occur with the bite or ingestion of the Spanish fly.Spanish fly is green in color with shiny wings of the same color. Cantharidin is an animal poisonproduced by cantharides (Spanish fly or blister beetle). It causes vesicle or blister formation andpriapism.The insect as such or the powder of dried body has the toxic (active) principle cantharidin. Theroute of absorption is skin and other mucosal surfaces.The image given below shows cantharides/ Spanish fly/ blister beetle.345",

      "question": "Which of the following acts as a physiological antidote to scorpion venom?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Physostigmine",
        "B": "Norepinephrine",
        "C": "Prazosin",
        "D": "Atropine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Prazosin acts as a physiological antidote for scorpion venom. The venom is a clear, colorless, proteinous toxalbumen, having a hemolytic and neurotoxic effect. Its toxicity is more than that of snakes, but only a small quantity is injected. The venom is a potent autonomic stimulator, resulting in the release of massive amounts of catecholamines from the adrenals. If the scorpion has hemolytic venom, the reaction is mainly local and simulates the viper snakebite. The scorpion sting will have only one hole in the center of the reddened area. The extremity will have edema, pain, and reddening. This usually lasts for one to two hours. The symptoms produced by a neurotoxic venom are similar to a cobra bite. There is usually no marked reaction in the local area. Nausea, vomiting, extreme restlessness, fever, various types of paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias, convulsions, coma, respiratory depression, and death may occur within hours from pulmonary edema or cardiac failure. Prazosin can counteract the alpha-adrenergic effects of autonomic stimulation, such as hypertension.",

      "explanation": "The above image shows a human bite mark. The photograph is taken with two scales at the rightangle to one another in the horizontal plane.Human bites are usually semi-circular or crescentic caused by the front teeth (incisors, canine).Swabs of bite marks should be taken immediately using a swab moistened with sterile water. Asample of the control area adjacent to the mark and of the victim's saliva should also be takenusing swabs moistened with sterile water.3463D imaging is done in which the image is measurable with high precision.A plastic substance such as rubber is laid over the bite mark which produces a permanent negativecast.347",
