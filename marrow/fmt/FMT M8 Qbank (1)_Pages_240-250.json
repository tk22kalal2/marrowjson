      "question": "You are performing an autopsy on a fetus born dead at 6 months. Which of the following is least likely to be seen in this case?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Mummification",
        "B": "Adipocere",
        "C": "Resorption",
        "D": "Maceration"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Adipocere formation cannot be an autopsy finding in the given scenario since fetuses under 7 months do not show this change. Adipocere is the formation of a soft, greyish-white, waxy, greasy material with an offensive, sweet, rancid smell, occurring in fatty tissues. It is due to postmortem hydrolysis or hydrogenation of the fats. It is a modification of putrefaction. It is seen most commonly in bodies immersed in water or in a damp, warm environment. Fetuses under 7 months do not show this change. If the pregnancy with the dead fetus continues, it may be gradually resorbed or mummified. Mummification occurs when the fetus dies from a deficient supply of blood, when liquor amnii is scanty, and when no air enters the uterus. It is also a finding in fetus papyraceous, which is the intrauterine demise of a fetal twin, where it is compressed between the membranes and the uterine wall. The most important post-mortem change in an intrauterine death is maceration, which is an autolytic process by which there is self-disintegration of the body by cellular enzymes. This can occur if the death of the fetus happens days to months before the delivery.",

      "explanation": "The hydrostatic test is falsely positive in the case of putrefied fetus.Hydrostatic test is done to determine whether the newborn has respired or not. It is also known asfloatation test/ Breslau's first life test/ Raygat's test.If the lung pieces float in water, it means that respiration has taken place, indicating a live birth. Ifthe pieces sink, respiration has not taken place, which means it is stillborn.An unrespired lung (stillbirth) may float, giving a false positive test, due to gases ofdecomposition, as seen in putrefaction.",

      "question": "You are using Haase's rule for the estimation of fetal age in a pregnant woman. Which of the following parameters is used here?",

        "A": "Biparietal diameter",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Rule of Haase enables the estimation of the age of the fetus in lunar months from its crown-heel length (in cm). According to the rule: When the crown-heel length ≤ 25 cm, Age in months = Square root of crown-heel length/2.45. When the crown-heel length > 25 cm, Age in months = crown-heel length divided by 5. Note: Haase's modification of Morrison's law states that during the last 5 months, the length in centimeters divided by 5 gives the age in months. Eg, crown-heel length = 30 cm, gestational age = 6 months.",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Nobbing fracture is a feature of battered baby syndrome (infantile whiplash syndrome).In battered baby syndrome, violent squeezing of the chest from side to side causes fracture ofcostochondral junctions and fracture along the posterior angles of the rib.After callus formation, which takes around 2 weeks, it gives a string of beads appearance inparavertebral region on X-ray, also known as nobbing fractures.Munchausen syndrome is also known as the factitious disorder imposed on self. Patientsdeceptively misrepresent, simulate, or cause symptoms of an illness and/or injury in themselves,even in the absence of obvious external rewards such as financial gain, housing, or medications.Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is defined as the sudden death of an infant, which remainsunexplained after a thorough case investigation, including the performance of a complete autopsy,examination of the death scene, and review of the clinical history.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of battered baby syndrome. The classical feature of thiscondition is injuries inflicted are of different ages and in different stages of healing. This is due tothe repetitive nature of child abuse.A battered child is one who has received repetitive physical injuries as a result ofnon-accidental violence, produced by a parent or guardian, there may also be deprivation ofnutrition, care, and affection.This syndrome must be considered in any child:• In whom the degree and type of injury varies with the history given•When injuries are of different ages and in different stages of healing•When there is a purposeful delay in seeking medical attention despite serious injury••Who exhibits evidence of fracture of any bone, subdural hematoma, failure to thrive, soft tissueswelling or skin bruising• Who dies suddenlySkeletal survey, which includes the following, should be done in a case of suspected child abuse:• AP views of the entire skeleton• Dedicated views of hands and feet246• Lateral views of appendicular skeleton, skull, and spine",

      "question": "A 2-month-old previously healthy baby was brought to the casualty when the parents foundthat the baby was not breathing while asleep. Following resuscitative measures, the baby wasstill apnoeic, pulseless, and asystolic. You suspected sudden infant death syndrome in thischild. Which of the following is not a risk factor of this condition?",

        "C": "Sleeping in prone position or on the side",
        "D": "Overheating while sleeping"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Sleeping on hard/ firm surfaces is not associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).Crowded sleeping areas with many pillows, blankets, and stuffed toys, or old, soft mattresses areassociated with an increased risk of SIDS.SIDS is also known as a 'cot' or 'crib' death. Usually, the parent finds the infant expired in the cribafter putting them to sleep. It is an unexpected death in a healthy infant, whose autopsy may notreveal a cause of death.70% of cases of SIDS are found at autopsy to have intrathoracic petechiae in the pleura,epicardium, and thymus. However, this feature is considered to be an agonal phenomenon. Thepresence of this feature alone should not raise concern for manual suffocation.Most cases of SIDS occur between 1-7 months of age but can occur up to 2 years. The riskincreases with male infants, multiple births, colder climates, and lower socioeconomic statusfamilies.Ways to reduce the risk of SIDS include:• Avoiding sharing a bed with the infant• Abstinence from smoking•• Using hard/firm bedding and keeping the sleeping area clear• Ensuring the infant sleeps supine•• Keeping the room temperature comfortable• BreastfeedingOption A: Sharing a bed with a family member is associated with SIDS. The risk is augmented ifthe parent has consumed alcohol or sedative medications.Option C: Sleeping prone or on the side is strongly associated with SIDS. The risk of regurgitationand choking is high in infants who sleep prone. These positions are associated with instability.Option D: Overheating while sleeping can occur if the baby has a fever or has been placed inexcessive clothing or in a warm room. Overheating has been associated with SIDS.247",

Both are different.The Act prescribes stringent punishment graded as per the gravity of the offence, with amaximum term of rigorous imprisonment for life and fine.Note- Gang penetrative sexual assault comes under aggravated penetrative sexual assault and notunder aggravated sexual assault.

In this condition, the gall bladder is distended.In starvation, bile does not get secreted into the duodenum due to the absence of food enteringthe stomach and intestine. Hence, bile gets accumulated in the gall bladder which gets distended.The feeling of intense hunger lasts for 30-48 hours. A person can survive for 10-12 days withoutfood and water and for 6-8 weeks without food alone.Loss of 40% of body weight is usually fatal. Loss of 70-90% of body fat and 20% of body proteinis fatal.
