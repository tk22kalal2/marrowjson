      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The earliest tooth to erupt in a 7-month-old baby (primary dentition) is a mandibular central incisor. The time of emergence of primary dentition or temporary teeth: The deciduous teeth all emerge into the mouth by 2.5-3 years. The time of emergence of secondary dentition or permanent teeth: Note: 6-13 years is the age of mixed dentition. First molar emerges at 6-7 years. Second molar emerges at 12 years and third molar emerges beyond 18 years of age. Tooth Emergence: Mandibular central incisor: 6-8 months. Tooth: Maxillary central incisor, Maxillary lateral incisor, Mandibular lateral incisor, First molar, Canine. Emergence: 7-9 months, 7-9 months, 10-12 months, 12-14 months, 17-18 months. Second molar: 20-30 months. Tooth Emergence: First molar: 6-7 years. Central incisor: 6-8 years. Lateral incisor: 7-9 years. First premolar: 9-11 years. Second premolar: 10-12 years. Canine: 11-12 years. Second molar: 12-14 years. Third molar: 18-25 years.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The 6 molars are called superadded teeth. Permanent dentition refers to the teeth which begin to erupt from the 6th year of age and remain throughout life. They are totally 32 in number. The tooth distribution in each jaw is as follows: 4 incisors, 2 canines, 4 premolars, and 6 molars. Thus, each jaw has 16 teeth. Among these, 4 incisors and 2 canines and 4 premolars are called successional teeth, which erupt in the place of predecessor deciduous teeth. The remaining 6 permanent molars (1st, 2nd, and 3rd molar teeth) erupt independently without any predecessor teeth. Hence, they are called superadded teeth.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Neonatal line is an incremental line found on the surface of tooth enamel, that indicates that an infant was live-born. The study of dental microstructure, which involves counting perikymata (incremental lines on the surface of tooth enamel), can provide an accurate method of age determination. One particularly pronounced incremental line, the neonatal line, can be of medicolegal significance in determining whether an infant was live-born or stillborn. It is formed very soon after birth and can be visualized by light microscopy if the child survived for about 3 weeks or by electron microscopy within 1 or 2 days of birth.",

      "explanation": "6-12 years is the age of mixed dentition and the number of teeth remains constant at 24. The period during which both primary and permanent teeth are in the oral cavity together is known as the mixed dentition period. This is the period where the deciduous teeth get replaced by permanent successors.",

      "question": "While examining the skeletal remains from a bomb blast, a forensic expert decides to use Gustafson's method for identification of the ages of people killed. Which of the following would you not assess in this method?",

        "D": "Transparency of the root"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Tooth length is not assessed in Gustafson's method. Gustafson's method of estimation of age of an individual is based on physiological changes in teeth. It is mainly useful in adults over 25 years of age. Gustafson's criteria include: Attrition - wear and tear changes of the occlusal surface; Periodontosis - regression of gums surrounding the tooth, resulting in loosening of the tooth and falling; Secondary dentin - deposition of dentin in the pulp cavity; Cementum apposition - deposition of cementum in the root, forming incremental lines; Root resorption involves both cementum and dentin; Transparency of the root - This is the most reliable criterion. Canals in dentin get filled with mineral and they become less transparent. Gustafson's method has now been largely replaced by Lamendin's method. Other methods of age determination based on teeth: Lamendin's method - It evaluates root dentine translucency, periodontopathy, and tooth length; Miles' method - Uses transparency of the root as a single criterion; Boyd's method - Determination of age of an infant by counting incremental lines on enamel; Stack's method - Determination of age by measuring dimensions of teeth; Variation in racemization of amino acids (especially aspartic acid) in dental pulp with age; Evaluating the reduction of the pulp chamber through X-rays.",

      "explanation": "Palmer's notation is used for charting of teeth. Teeth will be numbered from 1 to 8 starting from the central incisor till the third molar in each quadrant. The image given below shows Palmer's notation for teeth charting. Palmer Notation Permanent Dentition Upper Right Upper Left 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Lower Right Lower Left. The 4 most commonly used methods in dental charting are: 1. Universal system: Teeth are numbered 1 – 16 starting from upper right to upper left and 17 – 32 starting from lower left to lower right. 2. Palmer's notation: Teeth will be numbered from 1 to 8 starting from the central incisor till the third molar in each quadrant. 3. Haderup system: This is similar to Palmer's notation but plus sign (+) indicates upper teeth and minus sign (-) indicates lower teeth. 4. FDI (Federation Dentaire Internationale): Number is assigned to each quadrant and that number is placed before tooth's number.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The spheno-occipital suture fuses by about 18-20 years in females and by about 20-22 years in males. The timing of cranial suture closure was one of the first techniques used to estimate the age of adult individuals. The spheno-occipital suture on the skull base is particularly useful for aging young adults. The other cranial sutures show more variation in the timing of closure. Sagittal suture is used for age determination. Sutures ossify on the endocranial surface before they ossify on the ectocranial surface, and this must also be taken into account when using this method. Overall, this method of age determination is less reliable. Age of fusion of skull sutures: Suture Age of fusion Metopic suture 2-4 years Spheno-occipital suture 18-22 years Posterior third of sagittal suture 30-40 years Anterior third of sagittal suture 40-50 years Middle third of sagittal suture 50-60 years Coronal suture 40-50 years Sphenotemporal suture 50-60 years Squamous temporal suture >80 years",

        "A": "Fusion of distal end of ulna",
        "B": "Fusion of proximal end of ulna",

        "D": "Degenerative changes in teeth"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Complete union of the distal ulna is considered conclusive evidence of age more than 16 years in females. The appearance of ossification centers is complete by around 5 years. Thus, from birth to 5 years, the calendar of appearance of ossification centers is used for aging. After the age of 5 years, the fusion of epiphyses acts as a calendar up to the age of 25. The analysis of the hand and the wrist is the recommended method for living age diagnostics. But this technique frequently does not provide sufficient evidence to place an individual older than or younger than key threshold ages 16, 18, or 21. Additional radiographs needed to establish the threshold ages of 16, 18, or 21 can be any of the following: proximal humerus, distal end of the ulna or radius, distal femur, proximal tibia, or iliac crest. The proximal end of the ulna cannot be used to conclusively state that the individual is more than 16 years. This is because complete fusion of the proximal end may occur earlier than 16 years. Establishment of the age of 21 years can be done by evaluation of the medial end of the clavicle. Complete fusion occurs only beyond 22 years of age.",

Secondary ossification centres which are already present when an infant is born include: Calcaneus, Talus, Distal femur, Proximal tibia, Cuboid, Head of humerus.

Photographs of the skull are taken in exactly the same orientation in 3 planes as the available photograph. These are then enlarged to exactly the same dimensions as the photograph, and either the negative or a positive print is made on transparent film. This is then laid over the photograph and adjusted in an attempt to match up the major anatomical landmarks such as: Nasion, Supraorbital ridges, Angle of the jaw, Nasal aperture, External auditory meatus, and Teeth. The test is mainly an exclusory one, i.e., if the match cannot be made, then the skull is not that of the person in the photograph.
