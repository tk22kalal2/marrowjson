      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of organophosphorus (OP) poisoning. Clinical effects aredue to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase.Inhibition of cholinesterase leads to the accumulation of acetylcholine at the nerve synapses andneuromuscular junctions. This results in overstimulation of acetylcholine receptors resulting ina cholinergic crisis.The types of cholinesterases are:Acetylcholinesterase or RBC cholinesterase is helpful in the diagnosis of OP poisoning but has noprognostic significance.273It is hypothesized that inhibition of neuropathy target esterase enzyme may be responsible fororganophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN).The mechanism of action of the other agricultural poisons are:TypeAcetylcholinesterase or true or RBC cholinesteraseButyrylcholinesterase or plasma cholinesterase or pseudocholinesteraseNeuropathy target esteraseLocationRBC membranes Nervous tissueSkeletal muscleSerum LiverPancreasHeartBrainBrainKidneyCompoundCarbamatesMechanism of actionCarbamylation of carboxylicesteraseChlorate salts(sodium or pota Oxidation of hemoglobin tossium chlorates)ParaquatmethemoglobinFree radical-mediated damage",

        "A": "CNS symptoms can be seen in acute toxicity",
        "B": "Intermediate syndrome can be treated with atropine",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Intermediate syndrome is unresponsive to atropine and oximes. The syndrome occurs due toprolonged cholinesterase inhibition and muscle necrosis. Maintenance of nutrition,physiotherapy, prevention of bed sores and other routine measures to minimise discomfort alongwith ventilatory care are management options.•Four clinical syndromes are identified with respect to organophosphate exposure. They include:• Acute poisoning - This results in CNS, muscarinic, nicotinic, and somatic motor manifestations.Intermediate syndrome - It is usually observed 1-5 days after OP exposure. It is characterized byparalysis of neck flexors, muscles innervated by cranial nerves, proximal limb muscles, andrespiratory muscles.• Chronic toxicity - It is seen primarily in agricultural workers with daily exposure. It manifests assymmetrical sensorimotor axonopathy.Organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy - This is characterized by cognitive dysfunction,extrapyramidal symptoms, and peripheral neuropathy. It can lead to flaccid paralysis and musclewasting.",

      "explanation": "274Atropinization in organophosphate (rodenticide) poisoning does not cause regression of nicotinicsymptoms like muscle cramps.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Pralidoxime causes reversal of tongue fasciculations (nicotinic symptoms).Since atropine does not bind to nicotinic receptors, it is ineffective in treating neuromusculardysfunction. Pralidoxime (2-PAM) and other oximes, such as HI-6 and obidoxime, arecholinesterase-reactivating agents. Hence, its coadministration with atropine is effective intreating both muscarinic and nicotinic symptoms.Pralidoxime reactivates the acetylcholinesterase, which had been deactivated in organophosphatepoisoning. Pralidoxime attaches to the anionic site of the enzyme that remains unoccupied. Thenit reacts with the phosphorus atom of the organophosphorous compound which is attached to theesteric site to form a phospho-oxime complex. It then dissociates from the enzyme, regeneratingthe active enzyme.Pralidoxime should not be administered without concurrent atropine, in order to preventworsening of symptoms due to transient oxime-induced acetylcholinesterase inhibition.Note: Muscle cramps are nicotinic symptoms. However, abdominal cramps are muscarinicsymptoms.",

      "explanation": "There is no specific treatment for the intermediate syndrome in organophosphate (OP) poisoning. The intermediate syndrome is seen in 20-50% of acute OP poisoning cases. This syndrome develops one to several days after the poisoning, during the recovery from cholinergic manifestations. In some cases, it can occur when patients have completely recovered from the initial cholinergic crisis. Clinical features include paralysis of: neck flexor muscles, muscles innervated by the cranial nerves, proximal limb muscles, respiratory muscles - respiratory support may be needed. Symptoms or signs of cholinergic excess are absent in this syndrome. There is no specific treatment for the intermediate syndrome and intervention is exclusively supportive.",

However, until further research has beenundertaken, all patients poisoned with organophosphorus agents are recommended to be treatedwith an oxime.Urinary alkalinization, hemodialysis, and hemoperfusion have no role in the treatment of OPpoisoning.Note: Gastric lavage and activated charcoal administration are beneficial only in patients whopresent within 2 hours following ingestion of OP compounds.277",

      "explanation": "Carbamates can also lead to the intermediate syndrome.Option A: Carbamate-cholinesterase bond undergoes rapid, spontaneous hydrolysis which leads toregeneration of the enzyme within a few hours. This is called reversible carbamylation.Hence, aging (conversion of the inhibited enzyme into a non-reactivable form) does not occur andthe effect of carbamate toxicity is of a shorter duration.Option C: Carbamates do not effectively penetrate the CNS in adults. Hence, there is less CNStoxicity.Option D: Pralidoxime is contraindicated in carbamate poisoning because it may potentiate thetoxicity of carbamates due to its transient oxime-induced cholinesterase inhibition.278",
