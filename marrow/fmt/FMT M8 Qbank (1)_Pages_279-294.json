Additionally, neutralization ofthe acid with sodium bicarbonate will lead to the production of carbon dioxide, leading to gastricdistension and the risk of perforation.• Nasogastric intubation - This is done blindly and has the potential to exacerbate potential airwayinjuries.287Note: Oral intubation with direct visualization is the first choice for definitive airwaymanagement.",

Thus, the hemoglobin that can now bind to O2 is reduced to 50%causing a reduction in the graph's height.CO also increases the O2 affinity of remaining free hemoglobin sites which causes a left shift ofthe O2 hemoglobin dissociation curve.-Curve A - Myoglobin 02-dissociation curve (Myoglobin has a higher affinity towards O2 thanhemoglobin.
