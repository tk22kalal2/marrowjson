      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Choking is a modification applied to the barrel of a shotgun. Choke is where the barrel is modified such that it slightly tapers towards the muzzle. This will produce a narrower cone of shot when the ammunition is fired and thus, prevents dispersion of pellets. This can thus affect estimation of range of firing when examining the entry wound. Types of choking: • Improved cylinder • Modified choke • Half-choke • Full-choke. Note: The choke is a device towards the tapered end of the muzzle of a shotgun that aids in the estimates of range derived from the size of the wound and controls the shot pattern. It does not increase the range of the shotgun, thus making option A the appropriate choice. Types of Choking: Cylinder bore, Modified choke, Improved cylinder, Full choke.",

      "explanation": "Primary markings are specific to the make and model of the gun. These are formed when a bullet passes through a barrel and the sides are marked by the rifling of the barrel. Irregularities on the inner surface of the barrel itself, which are specific for that particular weapon, are also seen on the bullet and are called secondary markings / characteristic markings. Secondary markings are used for bullet fingerprinting. Rifling is the process of adding spiral grooves onto the inside of the barrel of a gun. The elevations between the grooves are called 'lands'. These grip the bullet and impart onto it a rotatory movement. This has a gyroscopic effect that increases the stability of the bullet's trajectory and hence the accuracy.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The retrograde propulsion of tissue from the entry wound towards the firearm is known as backspatter. Gunshot contact wounds and close-range discharges may cause blood and tissue fragments to enter the muzzle. It is due to negative pressure created following the discharge. This is known as backspatter. Sometimes blood and tissue may soil the hand or arm of the person firing the gun, a matter of considerable significance in forensic science. Option A: Blowback phenomenon: This is seen at the entry wound in a contact shot against a bone, where the gases rebound against the bone and exit through the entry wound, creating a stellate-shaped margin at the entry wound. Option B & C: Retrodispersion and backward scatter are not effects seen in firearm injuries.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "In the given image, A is the entry wound as it has a clean punched-in appearance on the outer table of the skull. Whereas B is the exit wound as it shows beveling (sloping surface) on the outer table of the skull. Entry wound: The initial contact of the missile punches a clean hole through the outer table of the skull. Where the bullet emerges internally, the inner table is then unsupported and a cone-shaped plug is detached, forming a crater that is appreciably larger than the external hole. Bevelling occurs on the inner table, and a punched-out hole occurs on the outer table. Exit wound: If the bullet traverses the cranium and penetrates the opposite side, the same pattern occurs, this time with the small hole on the inner table and the crater on the outside. Bevelling occurs on the outer table, and a punched-out hole occurs on the inner table. A Krönlein shot is a rare injury of the skull caused by a close-range shot. Here, the cranium is blasted open and large pieces of brain matter are ejected out of the skull.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Inverted edges of the wound",
        "B": "Round shape of an entry wound",
        "C": "Abrasion collar",
        "D": "Grease ring"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "A grease ring is a reliable sign to differentiate an entry from an exit wound. The abrasion collar or its inner parts may be blackened due to overlying sooty remnants wiped off by the bullet when hitting uncovered skin. This finding is called a grease ring, a ring of dirt or bullet wipe-off. It can be regarded as a reliable sign of entrance. Option A: Inverted edges cannot be regarded as a reliable sign of an entry wound. The edges of an entry wound may be everted by the blowback phenomenon in a contact wound. This occurs when the gases strike a bony surface and are reflected back, everting the entry wound edges. Option B: The round shape of entry wounds is unreliable, as entry wounds and exit wounds may be of many shapes. This depends on many factors, including the range of firing, angle of firing, presence of subcutaneous bone, etc. Option C: In an abrasion collar, the skin immediately around the central hole is discolored, the so-called ‘abrasion collar' or 'contusion ring'. The abrasion ring is primarily due to the massive overstretching and subsequent drying-up of the skin adjacent to the area of projectile impact. It cannot be taken as a reliable sign of an entry wound, as an exit wound may have a spurious abrasion collar. This occurs when the exit wound is supported against a hard surface and the emerging bullet slams the wound periphery against this surface.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "All the bullets mentioned in the options are modified to ensure that on entering the body, they slow down enough to impart maximum damage except tracer bullets. For damage to occur, some or all of the kinetic energy of the missile has to be absorbed by the target tissues, where it is dissipated as heat, noise, and mechanical disruption. When a missile passes completely through soft tissues, it may retain much of its original kinetic energy and fail to transfer any appreciable amount to the tissues. To ensure transfer of energy to the tissues, some missiles are especially designed or modified to slow up or stop within the body. Soft-headed bullets will flatten on impact and some are designed to fragment. The dumdum bullet fragments upon striking and transfers more energy for tissue displacement and disruption. Explosive-tipped bullets cause fire in the target due to the presence of explosives at the tip. They are designed to deform the missile to cause maximum deceleration. Tracer bullet sparks during flight. It contains a mixture of barium nitrate, powdered magnesium, and strontium nitrate.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The shape of the wound cavity can be explained by yawing of the bullet. Yawing is a common phenomenon seen with bullets (not with spheres). It is the rotation of the bullet around a lateral axis while passing through dense media such as tissues. The angle between the trajectory and the long axis of the bullet increases due to destabilizing forces until it reaches 90 degrees, i.e., the bullet's long axis is perpendicular to the trajectory. The yawing motion then continues until 180 degrees and the bullet will remain in this stable position where the base is the leading part. The path of a projectile in a dense medium therefore shows three distinct sections, depending on the respective cross-sectional area: • Narrow channel • Increased cavities • Tail end",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of a bullet graze. Bullet graze: the bullet just hits the skin only at an angle and goes off from the site, without any penetration or wound of entry. It produces an abrasion or a laceration depending on the thickness of the skin involved. Bullet bruise: the bullet here just hits the skin only and drops down to the ground, without any penetration or wound of entry. It produces a bruise alone at the site of impact.",

The fracture line resulting from the later bullet will typically stop at the previously formed one. Term 1. Puppe's Rule 2. Kennedy Phenomenon 3. Rayalaseema Phenomenon 4. Ewing's Postulates Description d. Chronological sequence of bullets fired a. Surgical intervention of a firearm wound leading to an artifact b. Planting a bullet inside a stab wound c. Relationship between trauma and new growth Kennedy's phenomenon: Surgical intervention of a firearm wound leading to an artifact as the evaluation of the wound as an entry or exit wound becomes difficult. Rayalaseema phenomenon: Here a person is killed by a stab injury, and a bullet is implanted inside to mislead the investigation. Ewing's postulates: Establishes a relationship between trauma and new growth. The following postulates should be satisfied before a relationship between trauma and new growth is accepted: • Evidence of previous integrity of the injured part. • Undeniable and adequate trauma must be proved. • There must be proof of a reasonable time interval between injury and appearance of tumor. • Disease must develop at the exact site of injury. • The nature of the tumor must be proved.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The sequence of gunshots, in this case, is 1° 2° 3 according to Puppe's rule. Puppe's rule states that the path of a second fracture line does not cross the path of an existing fracture line that appears or was caused before it. This helps the forensic expert determine the chronology (order) in which the bullets were lodged into the skull. Puppe's rule is used in forensic examination of skull fractures caused by multiple blunt force vectors as well, as it is not limited to the examination of bullet injuries only.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Intestine, Lung",

        "D": "Lung, Tympanic membrane"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "In underwater blasts, the intestines suffer the most damage. A blast causes the most damage at an interface between tissues in contact with the atmosphere, which is why the lung usually suffers the most severe damage. However, the most commonly affected structure in air blasts is the tympanic membrane. The gastrointestinal system suffers from the effect of a blast because, like the lung, it contains air and gases, and is thus not a uniform medium for the transit of the shock wave. Victims of explosions in water suffer a reverse order of gastrointestinal to lung damage. Note: In air, the ear, especially the tympanic membrane, is severely damaged; however, in a cadaver, it is not discernible without an otoscopic examination of the tympanic membrane. Nevertheless, lungs are considered to be the severely damaged organ in air due to variations in density between the alveolar walls and the contained air.",

      "question": "Following a blast, a man was brought from the scene to the emergency with multiple small puncture wounds to the right side of the chest, below the nipple, and multiple small abrasions and bruising over the left lower abdomen. Which of the following mechanisms is responsible for these injuries?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Flying missiles",
        "B": "Blast of air",
        "C": "Explosion burns",
        "D": "Building collapse"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given history of multiple small puncture wounds to the right side of the chest, below the nipple, and multiple small abrasions and bruising over the left lower abdomen are highly suggestive of blast injuries sustained due to flying missiles. Blast injury is a complex type of physical trauma resulting from direct or indirect exposure to an explosion, causing a sudden increase or decrease in atmospheric pressure. T.K. Marshall's (Marshall's triad) described the characteristic injuries associated with bomb explosions. It includes: abrasions, bruises/contusions, and puncture lacerations. Blast injuries are classified as: Primary injuries: the effect of transmitted blast waves on gas-containing structures. The external injuries are absent and are characterized by internal injuries. The middle ear, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract are the most susceptible to this. Secondary injuries: injuries caused by shrapnel and other airborne debris propelled by the explosion. These injuries may affect any part of the body and sometimes result in penetrating trauma. Most casualties are caused by secondary injuries. Tertiary injuries: these are caused by blast wind that can throw victims against solid objects. Quaternary injuries: all other injuries caused by explosions are not included in the above three categories, e.g., flash burns, crush injuries, respiratory effects due to toxic dust, gas, etc. Option B: Blast of air or blast wave causes primary injuries, which involve internal organs without external injury. Option C: Explosion burns: when the bomb explodes, the temperature of the explosive gases can exceed 2000°C, and the heat radiated momentarily can cause flash burns. It is a quaternary type of blast injury. Option D: Building collapse can cause crush injuries, which is a quaternary blast injury.",
