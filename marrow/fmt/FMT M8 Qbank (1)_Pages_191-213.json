      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Suffocation occurs when the respiratory tract is blocked, preventing oxygen from reaching the lungs. In this case, the clogging of the respiratory tract by semi-digested food particles would lead to suffocation.",

        "D": "These findings are uncommon in the dependent position"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The image shows petechiae called Tardieu spots. They are an unreliable sign of asphyxial death. Hemorrhages if larger than 2 mm are called ecchymoses and smaller than 2 mm are called petechiae. They are common non-specific autopsy findings and many are post-mortem in origin, especially in the dependent positions. They are caused by the rupture of small venules (capillary bleeding is invisible to the naked eye). It is suggested that the elevated expression of P-selectin could be used as a criterion to distinguish between antemortem findings from post-mortem artifacts. Other non-specific signs of asphyxia are: congestion of the larynx with slight oozing, emphysematous, congested lungs with serosanguinous fluid exudates in alveoli, and cyanosis or dark-colored blood due to accumulation of CO2.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The most marked congestion and cyanosis are seen in a case of traumatic asphyxia. It is the mechanical fixation of the chest (sitting on the chest). It acts by restricting respiratory movements and thus prevents inspiration. The four signs of asphyxia are as follows: Petechial hemorrhages, Congestion and edema, Cyanosis, and Engorgement of the right heart and abnormal fluidity of the blood. These signs are non-specific. But in traumatic asphyxia, there is a marked demonstration of these signs. In no other condition, apart from postural dependency, is the degree of congestion and cyanosis so marked.",

      "explanation": "Abrasions around the mouth, cheeks, lips, or lesions within the lips may reliably indicate smothering. The non-specific signs in deaths due to asphyxia: Petechial hemorrhages in the face, eyebrows, eyelids, forehead, ears, conjunctiva, sclera - When they occur in the visceral pleura, they are called Tardieu's spots. Emphysematous, congested lungs with serosanguinous fluid exudates in alveoli. Cyanosis or dark-colored blood due to accumulation of CO2. Congestion of the larynx with slight oozing. Pressure marks on the face can occur as a part of normal postmortem changes. Circumoral and circumnasal pallor can be caused merely by passive pressure of the dependent head after death. Note: The coexistence of these findings, in themselves, does not prove that death resulted from mechanical asphyxia. All these phenomena are non-specific and are in no way peculiar to this mode of death. They are of no value in proving that death resulted from mechanical asphyxia.",

      "question": "A 56-year-old man collapsed suddenly during dinner with his friends. They brought him to the ER, but he was already dead. On asking for further history, they revealed that they were drinking before having food. There were no signs of asphyxia, but on autopsy, a bolus of food lodging in the larynx was found. Which of the following statements about this syndrome is true?",

        "A": "Mostly occurs in thin-built individuals",
        "B": "Autopsy shows food lodged in the larynx only",
        "C": "Death is due to respiratory arrest",
        "D": "Death is often due to parasympathetic overactivity"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario is most likely suggestive of cafe coronary syndrome. Death in café coronary syndrome occurs due to parasympathetic overactivity. It is sudden and unexpected and happens rapidly. This is usually seen in well-built businessmen. In this syndrome, the victim dies during a meal with no signs of respiratory distress or classical signs of asphyxia. The cause of death in these patients is mechanical asphyxia leading to vasovagal reflex causing reflex cardiac inhibition. The mode of death is cardiac arrest (not the cause of death) presumably from parasympathetic overactivity occurring from stimulation of the laryngeal or pharyngeal mucosa. Suppressed gag reflex due to gross intoxication with alcohol or large doses of tranquilizers in mental institutions or hospitals might be the predisposing factors. Autopsy reveals a bolus of food lodged in the pharynx or larynx.",

        "D": "Lack of bleeding indicates postmortem fractures"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Damage to the laryngeal structures is more in manual strangulation than in ligature strangulation. During manual strangulation, the following structures are damaged: Hyoid cornua or horns, superior thyroid horns, cricoid cartilage, and the main ala of the thyroid cartilage. It has been said that such direct violence from the front tends to splay the fractured horns laterally, whereas in ligature strangulation, the horn tends to fall medially. If there is no hemorrhage, the fracture must be postmortem. If there is a small bleed, then the lesion can be either antemortem or post-mortem. Large bleeds definitely indicate an antemortem fracture. Damage to the laryngeal cartilages is much less common in ligature strangulation than in manual strangulation.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The image shows the tightening of a noose around the neck by twisting a rod within the ligature. This is called garrotting. This is a mode of ligature strangulation that may be seen in homicide. This was a form of judicial execution once employed in Spain. The rod-like object used to tighten the ligature is called a Spanish windlass - this may be a ruler, stick, or screwdriver. The method was also used by Thugs in the past in India, to kill travelers and rob their belongings in lonely places.",

        "D": "Incising the internal jugular vessels at the last"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Incising the internal jugular vessels early in the autopsy is done to relieve venous pressure, especially in cases where strangulation is suspected. This can help prevent artefactual haemorrhages that could otherwise complicate the interpretation of findings. During an autopsy, it is essential to release the blood in the venous system before dissecting the neck to avoid or reduce artefactual haemorrhages that can occur in the region. The following methods are also followed while conducting the autopsy: Reflect the scalp and remove the brain before dealing with the neck to release venous engorgement. Multislice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or radiography of the neck may be carried out before dissecting. If the new techniques of post-mortem imaging are not available, an alternative method is to X-ray the isolated larynx before dissection.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Both bruising around the neck and the fracture of the thyroid cartilage are findings seen in throttling. Throttling/manual strangulation is when bare hands are used to compress the neck and strangulate. Mechanism of death: Occlusion of blood vessels supplying blood to the brain (carotid arteries). Carotid sinus pressure may result in vagus nerve stimulation, resulting in cardiac arrest (vagal inhibition). Occlusion of the airway probably plays a minor role. Autopsy findings: Bruising of the neck - due to the grasping of the neck by the assailant. Abrasions on the neck - fingernail marks from the assailant or victim. Fracture of the thyroid cartilage. Inward fracture of the greater cornu of the hyoid bone.",

      "explanation": "The given autopsy images are suggestive of throttling. 205 Thumbnail impression over the neck. Petechial hemorrhages in the eye. Extravasated blood clots surrounding the larynx. 206 In throttling, the following mechanisms may lead to death: • Occlusion of blood supply to the brain - carotid arteries. • Occlusion of the airway - minor role. • Carotid sinus pressure may result in vagus nerve stimulation resulting in cardiac arrest (vasovagal shock). Other signs in deaths due to asphyxia: • Petechial hemorrhages in the face, eyebrows, eyelids, forehead, ears, conjunctiva, sclera. • When they occur in the visceral pleura, they are called Tardieu's spots. • Congested larynx with slight oozing. • Marked venous congestion of internal organs. • Emphysematous, congested lungs with serosanguinous fluid exudates in alveoli. • Dark-colored blood due to accumulation of CO2. Option B: Strangulation is a very generalized term used to describe deaths due to violent asphyxia. Eg- ligature strangulation, throttling, etc. Option C: In the case of hanging, there will be a ligature mark, injury to the cervical spine, etc. Option D: In the case of mugging, the neck is compressed or squeezed by holding it between the crook of the elbow or knee. The attack is usually made from behind. Though a victim killed by this method shows signs of asphyxia and other struggle marks, the examination of the neck will not show any evidence of violence, as the compression was affected by the soft muscles of the arm or leg.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The knot in a case of judicial hanging is placed under the ear in India. A legal death sentence is carried out by hanging the criminal. The face of the person is covered with a dark mask and he is made to stand on a platform above trapdoors. A rope to allow a drop of five to seven meters according to the weight, build, and age of the person, is looped around the neck, with the knot under the angle of the jaw. Although placing the knot beneath the chin, i.e., the submental position, is said to be a more effective way, a knot at the angle of the jaw (below the ear) is the most widely practiced method of judicial hanging in India.",

      "explanation": "Simon's hemorrhage / Simon's sign / Simon's symptom is streaky hemorrhage on the anterior aspects of the intervertebral disc, particularly in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine. It is frequently observed in cases of hanging. Simon hemorrhage has been shown to occur also in the course of traumatic overextension of the spinal column, e.g., in traffic accidents or as a post-mortem artifact in decomposed bodies.",

The mere emission of semen found at autopsy does not confirm sexual activity in itself, as post-mortem discharge of semen from the meatus is common in any type of death, not only in asphyxia.",

The following are the spurious hemorrhages that occur: • The posterior surface of the esophagus • Anterior longitudinal ligament of the cervical spine. Banding of the esophagus - pale areas in the mucosa caused by post-mortem hypostasis. Artefactual postmortem hemorrhage on the posterior surface of the esophagus is called Prinsloo and Gordon artifact.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given scenario is an example of traumatic asphyxia. Traumatic asphyxia results from respiratory arrest due to mechanical fixation of the chest, by a heavy substance or object. The normal movements of the chest wall are prevented. There is a gross compression of the chest and usually abdomen by a powerful force, due to which chest expansion and diaphragmatic lowering are prevented. Burking is a method of homicidal smothering and traumatic asphyxia where the assailant kneels or sits on the chest (traumatic asphyxia) and closes the nose and mouth with his hands (smothering). Smothering is a form of asphyxia that is caused by closing the external respiratory orifices either by the hand or by other means or blocking up the cavities of the nose and mouth by a foreign substance, such as mud, paper, cloth, etc. Overlaying or compression suffocation results due to compression of the chest, so as to prevent breathing. It occurs when an intoxicated parent or other person shares a bed with an infant. The thoracic movements are limited and respiratory exchange is either reduced or completely prevented, which leads to death. It is always accidental.",
