Option B: Run amok - Run-amok is a psychic disturbance resulting from continued use or sudden consumption of cannabis. It is characterized by a peculiar homicidal mania. The person is not held responsible for his acts since run amok is considered a disorder of mind and not intoxication.

Other named effects of drug use: • Crack dancing - Choreoathetosis and repetitive movements are associated with cocaine and amphetamine intoxication and appear related to dopamine dysregulation. • Crack eye - A syndrome of corneal abrasions and ulcerations secondary to smoke and irritation associated with crack cocaine use is known as the crack eye. • Crack baby - describes children who were exposed to crack as fetuses in the US. • Bad trip - Profound distortions in the perception of sensory stimuli, time, emotions, and memories occur with the use of LSD.

      "explanation": "Heroin is the most common drug which can cause physical dependence. Physical dependence is defined as a condition where withdrawal of a drug after its prolonged use causes physiological and emotional illness, often referred to as the withdrawal syndrome. Neither physical dependence nor withdrawal symptoms occur with hallucinogens. Although it is necessary to note that a user can develop a psychological dependence on the insight-inducing experiences of episodes of hallucinogen use. Hence, all 3 hallucinogens - ketamine, LSD, and Phencyclidine (PCP) do not cause physical dependence. According to the World Drug Report 2019, released by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the most common drugs used across the world (in decreasing order) include: Cannabis, Opioids, Amphetamine and prescription stimulants, Ecstasy, and Cocaine. Among the opioids, the commonly used group of drugs are opiates, which include drugs like opium, morphine, and heroin.",
