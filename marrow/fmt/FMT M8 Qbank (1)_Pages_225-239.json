Note: Adultery used to be a punishable offence under Section 497 IPC. It was scrapped down by the Supreme Court on 27th September 2018, and is no longer punishable.",

As the vagina is very small, it is impossible for the penetration of the adult organ to take place. In children, there are few or no signs of general violence, as the child is unaware of the assault and incapable of resisting.

      "explanation": "Mobile sperms in the vagina can be usually detected up to 6-12 hours after intercourse. Once deposited, the sperms may be recovered up to 72 hours from the vagina but they lose their motility. This evidence is useful in estimating the time of the assault. Venereal diseases and wounds can also be used to estimate the time of assault. The absence of spermatozoa in the female genital tract does not rule out the possibility of a sexual assault. Spermatozoa can be detected on the body up to 72 hours and semen up to 96 hours, after an assault.",

      "explanation": "The presence of smegma on the corona glandis indicates that the person has not engaged in a sexual act in the last 24 hours. Smegma requires about 24 hours to collect. It gets removed by bathing or washing or intercourse. The absence indicates sexual activity might have been performed in the last 24 hours as it gets rubbed off during intercourse. The presence of smegma absolutely negates the possibility of complete penetration.",
