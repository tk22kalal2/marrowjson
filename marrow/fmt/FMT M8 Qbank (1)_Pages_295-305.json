      "explanation": "300There are no significant gender differences concerning renal elimination affecting the BloodAlcohol Concentration(BAC) levels.BAC following the ingestion of ethanol is influenced by many factors. These include:-• Weight Women on average are smaller than men, so have less fluid in their bodies for alcoholdistribution•Body fat percentage - Since women have greater body fat, their aqueous compartment is smallerand hence they achieve a higher BAC.•Gastric alcohol dehydrogenase - Some ethanol is broken down in the stomach by gastric alcoholdehydrogenase, which lowers the amount available for absorption. This enzyme is present athigher levels in men than in women.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "In isolated ethanol intoxication, the occurrence of horizontal gaze nystagmus indicates a BAC level of around 80 mg/dl. It has a 70-80% sensitivity. Horizontal gaze nystagmus has been shown to correlate highly with both BAC and cognitive impairment. The HGN test assesses lack of smooth pursuit, sustained endpoint nystagmus, and induced nystagmus prior to a lateral gaze angle of 45 degrees. BAC levels corresponding to the clinical features are: Blood alcohol concentration 0 to 50mg%: 50 to 100mg%: 100 to 150mg%: Effects No significant or mild euphoria Decreased inhibition, increased self-confidence, decreased attention span, slurring of speech, alteration of judgment, nystagmus Mental confusion, emotional instability, loss of critical judgment, ataxia, impaired memory, sleepiness.

This assumption does not apply if the person wasintoxicated without their knowledge or against their will.303Option A: Section 84 IPC (Sec 22 BNS) - Act of a person of unsound mind-No act is an offencewhich is undertaken by a person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind,is incapable of knowing the nature of the act or understanding of what is being done is eitherwrong or contrary to law. This does not apply to the man, who was not of unsound mind. Section84 IPC (Sec 22 BNS) does apply in the case of delirium tremens.Section 85 IPC (Sec 23 BNS)- No act is an offence which is done by a person who at the time ofdoing it, by reason of intoxication, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act or what he isdoing is either wrong or contrary to law; provided that what intoxicated him was administered tohim without his knowledge or against his will. Here, Section 85 IPC (Sec 23 BNS) does notapply because the alcohol was not administered to him against his will.Option C: Section 510 IPC (Sec 355 BNS) - Misconduct by a drunken person in public ispunishable with imprisonment of up to 24 hours.

      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of methanol poisoning. Hemodialysis is effective and used insevere cases.A serum methanol concentration greater than 50 mg/dl is an indicator for hemodialysis. It can beused to remove both methanol and its toxic metabolite formic acid from the blood.Fomepizole, an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor is indicated in methanol toxicity. It acts byinhibiting the formation of toxic formic acid.Intravenous ethanol is an alternative to fomepizole. It has a higher affinity to alcoholdehydrogenase than methanol. Therefore, a saturation of ADH enzymes results in less formationof toxic formic acid.Folate-dependent systems are responsible for the oxidation of formic acid to CO2. Both folinic andfolic acid are often administered during methanol toxicity but the exact benefit is yet to bedetermined.305",
