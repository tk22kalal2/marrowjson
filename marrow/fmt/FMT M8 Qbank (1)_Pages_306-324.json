There is no effective treatment for patients with toxic chronic exposure to organic mercury, and hence only supportive care is provided. This is most commonly associated with the consumption of mercury-rich fish (such as shark, swordfish, bonito, mackerel, marlin, and bluefin tuna). Symptoms are generally resistant to treatment with chelators. Dimercaprol (BAL) should not be used, because it increases the mobilization of mercury to the brain. Treatment with oral DMSA is unlikely to reverse the neurologic damage. Hence, there is no effective treatment for Minamata disease. For patients with toxic exposure to elemental mercury or inorganic mercury, the following are effective: DMSA (succimer), DMPS, and BAL (dimercaprol). For severe acute organic mercury poisoning, succimer is used.",

It is toxic because it can substitute for calcium in many fundamental cellular processes. It crosses red blood cell membranes as well as the blood-brain barrier and enters the neuroglia cells which support brain function. The fatal dose of lead acetate is 20 g. The fatal period is 1-2 days. Lead poisoning: Glycine + Succinyl CoA → ALA Synthase → ALA → ALA Dehydratase → Porphobilinogen → Protoporphyrin IX → Ferrochelatase → Heme.

      "explanation": "The correct order of symptomatology in iron toxicity is 3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 4 -&gt;1.Symptoms of iron toxicity are divided into 4 stages:•Stage 1 (few hours after ingestion): vomiting, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, shock,acidosis, and coma•Stage 2 (6-24 hours): Asymptomatic phase•Stage 3 (24-48 hours): Metabolic acidosis, jaundice, hypoglycemia, shock, coma with hepatic andrenal failure.•Stage 4 (1-2 weeks): Late complications such as gastric stricture and pyloric stenosis.Iron exerts its toxic effects by increasing capillary permeability, release of hydrogen ions,inhibition of mitochondrial function, and direct corrosive action on the gastric mucosa. Ingestionof 20 to 30 grams is considered to be fatal and the fatal period is around 24-30 hours.Desferrioxamine is the mainstay of treatment with supportive gastric lavage, administration of eggand milk to form iron-protein complexes, oral MgOH solution, and hemodialysis in severe cases.Postmortem changes in iron toxicity include:• Hemorrhagic necrosis of gastric mucosa with perforation of gastric or jejunal wall• Acute hepatic necrosisDegenerative renal tubular changes324",
