        "A": "It can cause acute liver injury",
        "B": "It can cause lung injury",
        "C": "It can cause cardiac arrhythmia",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Forced acidic diuresis is not indicated in any scenario as its potential risks (suchas rhabdomyolysis, acute renal injury) outweigh any potential benefits.Note: Though some books say that acidic diuresis is indicated in few poisoning, it is onlytheoretic. Forced acidic diuresis is never indicated due to the associated risks.",
