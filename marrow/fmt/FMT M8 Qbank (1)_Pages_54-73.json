      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The husband can be booked under Section 108 of the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (306 of the Indian Penal Code), which deals with the abetment of suicide. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India on 27th September 2018 struck down IPC 497 dealing with adultery as unconstitutional. However, the court noted that if any aggrieved spouse commits suicide because of the life partner's adulterous relation, then, if the evidence is produced, it could be treated as an abetment to suicide. Consensual sexual intercourse between adults of the same sex no longer comes under the purview of section 377 of IPC (as per the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court on 6th September 2018). Hence, there are no sections corresponding to IPC 497 and 377 in the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).",

      "explanation": "In the case of civil negligence, the burden of proof is on the patient. The question of civil negligence arises when a suit is filed in a civil court: by a patient or his/her relatives against the doctor for getting compensation from the doctor if he/she has suffered an injury due to the doctor's negligence; or by a doctor against the patient or his/her relatives to collect the fees, the payment of which has been refused due to alleged professional negligence by the doctor. In either case, the patient has to prove that the doctor has committed professional negligence. To prove negligence, all the following four elements must be present: Duty - a duty of care by the doctor must exist; Dereliction - the physician must maintain the standard of a 'prudent physician' under similar circumstances. If the physician fails to maintain the standard of care, it is called dereliction; Direct causation - the negligent act or omission must directly cause the injury without any intervening cause; Damage - the negligent act must cause damage of a type that would have been foreseen by a reasonable physician.",
