      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "In the given scenario, ring fracture is most likely to have caused the fatal injury. These are the most common fractures that occur due to a fall from height. These occur in the posterior fossa around the foramen magnum. If the kinetic energy of the fall is not absorbed by fractures of the legs, pelvis, or spine, the impact is transmitted up the cervical spine. This force may be rammed into the skull, carrying a circle of occipital bone with it.",

      "options": {
        "A": "In hammer injury to the skull, the most common complication is subdural hemorrhage",
        "B": "Fracture lines on the skull usually cross each other to form a grid-like pattern",

        "D": "The most common skull fracture type is the depressed skull fracture"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "At the point of contact of the weapon (hammer) with the skull, the inner table is likely to fracture. When the skull receives a focal impact, there is a momentary distortion of the shape of the cranium. The area under the point of impact bends inwards. As the contents of the skull are virtually incompressible, there must consequently be a compensatory distortion or bulging of other areas. This is the struck hoop analogy. Both these intruded and extruded areas can be the site of fracturing if the distortion of the bone exceeds the limits of its elasticity. The inner table will fracture where the skull is indented and the outer table will fracture at the margins of the deformed area. Option A: Trauma most commonly causes subarachnoid hemorrhage, not subdural hemorrhage. Option B: Fracture lines of the skull do not cross each other. This forms the basis for Puppe's rule. Option D: The most common type of skull fracture is linear.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario describes a lucid interval, and it is classically associated with extradural/epidural hemorrhage (EDH). Patients with EDH present with 3 phases: \n   1. The patient is initially unconscious from the concussive aspect of the head trauma.\n   2. The patient then awakens and has a lucid interval while the hematoma sub-clinically expands.\n   3. As the volume of the hematoma grows, intracranial pressure (ICP) increases, and the patient rapidly becomes lethargic and unconscious. \n   A lucid interval is a period of normal consciousness, and here the person is legally bound by the laws that affect normal people.",

        "D": "It is the least common type of traumatic brain membrane hemorrhage"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Extradural hemorrhages (EDH) cannot be ruled out in the absence of a skull fracture. Most EDH are associated with skull fractures. They usually occur unilaterally in the parieto-temporal area, caused by the rupture of the middle meningeal artery (usually the posterior branch). However, they can occur rarely in the absence of any skull fractures or external injuries. It is the least common type of brain membrane bleeding. A minimum volume of 35 ml is needed before clinical signs are apparent. The clinical signs of an epidural hemorrhage are classically those of a lucid or latent interval.",

      "question": "A victim of a house fire is brought to you for autopsy. On examination, you find an intracranial collection of blood. It is brown and friable, and the adjacent brain tissue shows discoloration. The carboxyhemoglobin level in the extradural blood is found to be the same as in the peripheral blood. What is the likely diagnosis?",

        "C": "Heat hematoma",
        "D": "A or C, depending on further pathological examination"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The diagnosis in the given scenario is that of a heat hematoma. Heat hematoma is an artifact that mimics EDH (extradural hemorrhage). This occurs when the head has been exposed to severe external heat sufficient to burn the scalp and skull. The blood may be extruded from the diploë and venous sinuses into the extradural space to produce a heat hematoma. This false hematoma is brown and friable, and the adjacent brain tissue shows hardening and discoloration from the heat. There is often a significant level of carboxyhemoglobin in the body if the death occurred when the fire was in progress. This should be of the same concentration in the heat hematoma as in the peripheral blood. If the victim suffered a head injury before the fire started (indicating an extradural hemorrhage), then there should be little or no carboxyhemoglobin in the hematoma.",

      "explanation": "A subdural hemorrhage is likely to be seen in an autopsy of victims of punch-drunk syndrome. The punch-drunk syndrome is also known as dementia pugilistica. In this condition, gross findings of the brain include: • Cortical atrophy, slight hydrocephalus, • Perforated septum pellucidum, • Enlargement of the cavum septi pellucidi, • Tearing of the septal leaves. The cortical atrophy leads to stretching of the bridging veins, which predisposes to a subdural hemorrhage. It is a cumulative process and many episodes of minor head injury add up to produce the typical lesions described.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Fracture of the skull may not occur, even in the presence of severe coup and contrecoup injuries",
        "B": "A fall on the frontal region will produce an occipital contrecoup",

        "D": "The most common site for contrecoup injury is the frontal and temporal lobes"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "A fall on the frontal region will not produce an occipital contrecoup injury. This is due to the relatively smooth internal surface of the posterior cranial fossa. Coup injury is damage that occurs on the same side of the direct trauma. Contrecoup injuries are present opposite to the site of trauma and are due to shear strain. Fracture of the skull may not occur, even in the presence of severe coup and contrecoup injuries (option A). The skull's anterior and middle cranial fossae have sharp edges. This makes the temporal and frontal lobes highly prone to contrecoup injuries (option D). A fall on the temporal region can produce a contrecoup injury on the contralateral lobe due to the presence of the falx cerebri, not the ipsilateral lobe (option C). During the impact, the brain moves in the opposite direction, striking the falx cerebri, resulting in contrecoup injury on the opposite lobe, not the same lobe as the impact, but opposite to the site of initial trauma.",

      "explanation": "From the given options, the hippocampus is most likely to show evidence of damage in the case of a hypoxic brain injury like strangulation. However, third and fourth cortical layers are best for displaying the histological changes of hypoxia. The parts of the brain most suitable for seeking evidence of hypoxic damage are: • Boundary zones of the cerebral cortex (the grey matter) - most vulnerable because they lie at the terminal reach of the arterial supply; Hippocampus (especially CA1 sector = Sommer's area and subiculum); • Cerebellar folia; • Globus pallidus in the basal ganglia.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The likely cause of injury in the given scenario is shattered windshield glass injury. In a road traffic accident, the shattered windshield glass produces multiple lacerations, usually on the face. These lacerations resemble sparrow footmarks due to contact with the shattered windscreen glass.",

      "question": "A pedestrian hit by a car hurls up onto the windshield, following which his head strikes the road. How is the head injury described?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Primary impact injury",
        "B": "Secondary impact injury",
        "C": "Tertiary impact injury",
        "D": "Quaternary impact injury"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "In this case, the head injury is an example of a tertiary impact injury. The pedestrian sustained impacts twice (car bumper - primary, windshield - secondary) before hitting the road. Injuries to pedestrians: Primary impact injuries are caused by the first impact of the vehicle on the victim. Secondary impact injuries are further injuries caused by the vehicle. Tertiary impact injuries are caused when the victim strikes other objects or falls on the ground after being hit by the vehicle. Note: In case a pedestrian is hit by the vehicle only once (i.e., only primary impact and no secondary impact by the vehicle) and then sustains injuries by falling on the road, it would be an example of a secondary injury.",

      "options": {
        "A": "The rear seats are more dangerous than the front seats in a car",
        "B": "Airbags have greatly improved the safety of cars and are not associated with any injuries",
        "C": "Thoracic injuries are more common in the front-seat passenger than the driver",
        "D": "Tail-gating refers to injuries caused by a head-on collision with a car"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The rear seats of a car are more dangerous than the front seats. Option B: Airbags have greatly improved the safety of cars; however, they are associated with injuries themselves, like amputation of fingers, fracture of arms, cervical spine, and head injury. Option C: Thoracic injuries are more common in the driver than the front-seat passenger due to the steering wheel. Option D: Tail-gating accident occurs when a bike rider drives into the back of a truck. The bike passes underneath, but the head of the motorcyclist impacts on the tail-board. It may also happen to motor cars, and the rear of the truck smashes into the windscreen and driver.",
