      "explanation": "The minimum Bishop Score required before proceeding with induction of labour is 6.A Bishop score &gt;8 conveys a high likelihood of a successful induction. The latest guidelinesstate that a cut-off score of 6 can be used to choose between pharmacological and mechanicalmethods of induction.This score is calculated based on the:•station of the fetal head• dilation of cervix⚫ cervical length•position of cervix• consistency of the cervix.This score is an important determinant of a successful induction.",

      "explanation": "Uterine tachysystole is defined as &gt;5 contractions in a 10 min period and may occur inspontaneous or stimulated labor. It should always be qualified by the presence or absence of fetalheart rate abnormalities. Tachysystole interrupts maternal blood flow to the placenta duringcontractions and may lead to a reduction in fetal oxygenation. It is also associated with placentalabruption.It is caused by pharmacological agents used for cervical ripening and induction such asmisoprostol (both oral and vaginal) and dinoprostone.

      "explanation": "Controlled artificial rupture of membranes (ARM) is performed in a patient with amniotic fluidindex (AFI) ≥ 25 cm.

      "explanation": "Stripping of membranes is being depicted in the image, which elicits the Ferguson reflex. It is alsoknown as the fetal ejection reflex and is seen due to the pressure at the internal os of the cervix.It is associated with an increase in blood levels of a prostaglandin F2° metabolite, also known asdinoprost.

      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The Bishop's score is rapidly improved by the use of laminaria tents.It is a mechanical cervical dilator and acts by hygroscopic osmotic action, leading to slowdilatation of the cervix. The gentle dilatation by laminaria tents induces an endogenous synthesisof prostaglandins causing a softening of the cervix. This is useful in cervical ripening beforeinduction of labour.229",

      "explanation": "Abdominal amniocentesis followed by oxytocin drip is a safe method for induction of labor inpolyhydramnios.Abdominal amniocentesis drains a good amount of liquor (amnioreduction), after which theoxytocin infusion can be started. This will minimize the sudden decompression and reduce therisk of placental separation, cord prolapse and change in lie of the fetus.Although polyhydramnios does not constitute an absolute contraindication for the application ofprostaglandins, these substances should be administered with caution. There is a marked increasein the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage and amniotic fluid embolism with their use.Hence, amnioreduction is a preferred mode of treatment in polyhydramnios.",
