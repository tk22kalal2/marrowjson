      "explanation": "The fetal ACTH causes an increase in estrogen, acting as the onset of labor in pregnant women. It results in the growth of the fetal adrenal gland, which has the capacity for steroid biosynthesis, i.e., estrogen. Daily steroid production of fetal adrenal glands near term is more than in adults.

      "explanation": "Stripping of membranes is depicted in the image, which elicits the Ferguson reflex. Fetal ejection reflex or Ferguson reflex is a phenomenon in which mechanical stretching of the internal cervix enhances uterine activity. Release of oxytocin from the maternal pituitary has been suggested but not proven. It is seen in stripping/sweeping and artificial rupture of membranes. Both of these are methods of induction of labor. It is associated with an increase in blood levels of prostaglandin F2α metabolite, also known as dinoprost/carboprost.",

      "explanation": "Image B shows the Duncan method of placental separation. Schultze method, Mathews-Duncan method, Brandt Andrew's method, Type III Placenta Previa. Comparison between two types of placental separation methods: Brandt Andrew's method or controlled cord traction is a manoeuvre of expressing the placenta from the uterus in the third stage of labour. One hand grasps the umbilical cord while the other is placed on the mother's abdomen with the fingers over the anterior surface of the uterus. While the hand on the abdomen is pressed backwards and slightly upward, the other applies gentle traction on the cord. Type III placenta previa is a type of incomplete or partial central placenta previa. Here, the placenta covers the internal os partially, i.e., it covers the internal os when closed but does not entirely do so when fully dilated. Schultze method: Separation begins from the center of the placenta to the periphery. Blood does not escape externally, as the blood pours into the membrane sac. Duncan method: Separation begins from the periphery to the center. Blood escapes from the vagina as the blood collects between the membranes and the uterine wall.",

      "explanation": "The practice of guarding the perineum during delivery of the fetal head is part of the WHOmanagement guidelines for the second stage of labor.The fingers of one hand support the perineum, while the second hand applies pressure to the fetalhead to control the speed of crowning. The advantage of this is to prevent perineal tears.The second stage of labor begins with full dilatation of the cervix and ends with the delivery of thefetus.The main events include the descent of the fetus (bearing down by the mother, uterinecontractions), cardinal movements of labor, and delivery of the fetus.Management of the second stage of labor:• The most common position used is the dorsal position with the hips flexed, knees flexed andabduction of the thighs. WHO recommends any position of choice including the upright position.• WHO recommendations for the prevention of perineal tears include warm compresses to theperineum, perineal massage, guarding the perineum, and modified Ritgen's maneuver.• Modified Ritgen's maneuver: A sterile towel or pad is held in one hand and placed over theperineum; the other hand applies gentle downward pressure on the occiput to promote flexionand controlled delivery of the head (ensuring the smallest diameter of the head passes through theoutlet). Once the occiput is born-with gentle pressure, the head is extended-forehead, nose, andmouth are then delivered.• WHO doesn't recommend fundal pressure and routine episiotomy.Other options:Option A: A liberal or routine episiotomy is discouraged. Episiotomy is indicated in cases of:•Shoulder dystocia•Breech delivery• Fetal macrosomia•Operative vaginal deliveries• Persistent occiput posterior positionsOption C: Manual techniques, such as massage or application of warm compresses, arerecommended for healthy pregnant women requesting pain relief during labor.Option D: The position that is most comfortable to the mother i.e. upright/squatting position isencouraged.

It usually appears prior tothe onset of true labor pain by 1 or 2 weeks in primigravidae and by a few days in multiparae.Such pains are probably due to stretching of the cervix and lower uterine segment withconsequent irritation of the neighboring ganglia.FeaturesTrue labour painsFalse labour painCervical dilatation and effacementPresentAbsentPainLower abdomen and back, radiating to thighsLower abdomenonlyShowPresentAbsentBag of waterFormedAbsentRelief with enemaNoYes",

This is done for a minimum time of 60 seconds after delivery forpreterm infants not requiring immediate resuscitation after birth. It states that DCC must be doneeven if the mother has an HIV infection. But as per the NACO guidelines, early cord clamping isadvised.201",

They can be blunt-tipped/pointed tip/straight or curved.Straight mayo scissors are designed for cutting body tissues near the surface of a wound. They arealso used to cut sutures and are also known as suture-cutting scissors.Curved mayo scissors allow much deeper penetration into the wound and are used to cut thicktissues such as those found in the uterus, muscles, breast, and foot. Mayo scissors used fordissection are placed in tissue with the tips closed.
