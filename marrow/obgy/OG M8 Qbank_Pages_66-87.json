      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "A placental cotyledon is comprised of the area supplied by multiple truncal chorionic villi. It is the functional unit of the placenta. A placental cotyledon or placental lobule constitutes one truncal or main stem villus and its ramifications. Each lobule is supplied by a single truncal branch of the chorionic artery. Each lobule also has a single vein. The lobules constitute functional units of placental architecture. The fetal surface is the chorionic plate. The umbilical cord inserts in the center of the chorionic plate. Note: The entire placenta is supplied by chorionic villi, while each cotyledon is only supplied by a single main stem villus with its branches.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Maternal leucopenia is not seen in pregnancy; instead, leucocytosis is seen. This plays no part in the prevention of rejection of the fetus. The fetus is a semi-allogenic graft inside the maternal body, as half of its genes are from the father. Uterine transplantation immunity contributes to the survival of the fetus, despite it being semi-allogenic. This occurs due to the following factors: Decidual natural killer cells are inefficient and therefore are unable to attack the 'foreign' fetal cells. Decidual stromal cells work with natural killer cells to allow trophoblastic invasion. Villous trophoblastic cells do not express HLA antigens and therefore are non-immunogenic.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) does not cause involution of the corpus luteum, but it maintains corpus luteum function. hCG is produced by the syncytiotrophoblasts of the placenta. It is a glycoprotein hormone with two subunits. The alpha-subunit is similar to LH, FSH, and TSH. The beta-subunit is specific and is measured by pregnancy tests. hCG can be detected in maternal blood 8 days after fertilization. Thus, it can help in diagnosis of pregnancy even before the period is missed. Its levels nearly double every 48 hours in early pregnancy, reaching a maximum of 50,000 - 100,000 IU/L by 60-70 days of gestation. Then the level starts falling, reaching a minimum at 16 weeks, which continues throughout pregnancy.",

Normally, the chorionic plate and basal plates are of the same size. In conditions of extrachorial placentation, the chorionic plate is smaller than the basal plate. There are two types of extrachorial placentation: Circummarginate placenta - In this type, the space between the fetal membranes and the basal plate is filled up by fibrin and old hemorrhage. Circumvallate placenta - In this type, the peripheral chorion is thickened into a ridge composed of a double fold of chorion and amnion. Complications associated with circumvallate placenta are: Preterm delivery, Abortions, IUGR, Antepartum hemorrhage, Retained placenta and membranes. Extrachorial placentation: Decidua, Normal, Basal plate limit, Chorionic plate limit, Circummarginate, Circumvallate, Chorionic membrane, Basal plate, Circumvallate placenta, Fetal surface, Cord, Chorionic plate.

A succenturiate placenta contains single or multiple accessory lobes. Accessory lobes are attached to the main lobe by a membrane that has a leash of blood vessels. Option A: Bilobate placenta - it consists of two placental lobes. The cord inserts between the two lobes. Option C: Placenta membranacea - the entire surface of the fetal membranes are covered by functioning villi and the placenta develops as a thin membranous structure occupying the entire periphery of the chorion.

      "explanation": "Ultrafiltrate of maternal plasma contributes to the formation of amniotic fluid during early pregnancy. Amniotic fluid is formed by: • Early pregnancy - ultrafiltrate of maternal plasma. • Second trimester - the extracellular fluid that diffuses through the fetal skin and thus reflects the composition of fetal plasma. • After 20 weeks - keratinization of fetal skin prevents diffusion across the skin. Hence, fetal urine forms amniotic fluid. Note: Fetal kidneys start producing urine at 12 weeks (8-11 weeks), and by 18 weeks, they produce 7 to 14 mL per day.",

      "explanation": "The amniotic fluid index (AFI) is a measure of the amniotic volume, which is maximum at 34 weeks of gestation. The volume of amniotic fluid at each week is variable. The volume gradually increases till 32-34 weeks of gestation. At 34 weeks, it is maximum, and thereafter, there is a gradual reduction till term. Amniotic fluid volume is a passive reflector of the fetal condition. Its volume is determined by the following: Any alteration in fetal homeostasis, caused by fetal and maternal conditions, affects the amniotic fluid volume. Thus, AFI is measured as a part of the biophysical score. Pathway: Fetal urination + 1000-750, Fetal swallowing - 750, Fetal lung fluid secretion + 350, Intramembranous flow across fetal vessels on the placenta's surface - 350.",

      "explanation": "The nutritive value of amniotic fluid is negligible because amniotic fluid is predominantly water. It contains the following: Water 98-99%, Solids 1-2% (Organic, inorganic, suspended particles). Functions of amniotic fluid during pregnancy: It acts as a shock absorber and prevents trauma to the fetus, Temperature regulation of the uterine environment, It distends the amniotic sac and thereby allows for growth and free movement of the fetus. It has no nutritive function, as it is mostly formed by water. Bacteriostatic property. Functions of amniotic fluid during labor: The amnion and chorion are combined to form a hydrostatic wedge which helps in dilatation of the cervix. During uterine contraction, it prevents any interference in placental circulation so long as the membranes remain intact. It protects the umbilical cord by providing a cushion between the fetus and the umbilical cord during contraction. It flushes the birth canal at the end of the first stage of labor and by its aseptic action protects the fetus and prevents ascending infection to the uterine cavity.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The composition of amniotic fluid is not the same throughout pregnancy, but changes later in pregnancy due to contamination by fetal urinary metabolites. In early pregnancy, it is identical to plasma in composition, as it is mainly composed of a transudate of plasma. In late pregnancy, as amniotic fluid is primarily formed by fetal urination, the composition is altered. Disorders of the fetal kidney can lead to oligohydramnios. Fetal swallowing is the primary method of resorption of amniotic fluid. Disorders of swallowing in the fetus can cause polyhydramnios. Amniotic fluid is alkaline in nature, and this helps in differentiating it from vaginal secretions, which are acidic.

A 28-year-old G2P1L1 at 35 weeks of gestation is complaining of difficulty in breathing. On examination, flanks are full, and abdominal girth is 160cm. Ultrasound determined that the SDP is 10cm. What is the next step in management?",

      "explanation": "The given case scenario is suggestive of fetal compromise. The management in this patient is immediate termination of pregnancy. Since this pregnancy has crossed 34 weeks, it can be terminated by cesarean section. Abnormal flow patterns in the umbilical artery: \n   • Reduced end-diastolic flow indicates uteroplacental insufficiency (S/D ratio increases)\n   • Absent end-diastolic flow suggests fetal compromise, hence the pregnancy is terminated by C-section if >34 weeks.\n   • Reverse end-diastolic flow suggests impending doom of death, hence the pregnancy is terminated by C-section if >32 weeks.\n   Patterns of end-diastolic flow in the umbilical artery: \n   Normal diastolic flow\n   Absence of end-diastolic flow\n   Reversal of end-diastolic flow",

        "A": "It has one artery and two veins",
        "B": "It contains a gelatinous substance called Wharton's jelly",

        "D": "Normal average umbilical cord length is 50-60 cms"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The umbilical cord normally has two arteries and one vein. The presence of a single umbilical artery is the most common vascular anomaly of the cord. It is associated with congenital anomalies such as genitourinary and cardiac anomalies. The umbilical cord is a tube that connects the fetus to the placenta. It contains umbilical vessels and an obliterated allantois duct, all surrounded by Wharton's jelly and contained within an outer layer of amnion. Maternal blood enters the fetus through the umbilical vein, and blood exits the fetus via the two umbilical arteries. Wharton's jelly is a gelatinous mucopolysaccharide that protects the umbilical vessels. Local collections of Wharton's jelly produce false knots in the cord. The average length of the umbilical cord is between 40-70 cm at term. A long cord can form a loop around the fetus' neck and can cause asphyxia. A short cord can result in cord rupture during labor.",
