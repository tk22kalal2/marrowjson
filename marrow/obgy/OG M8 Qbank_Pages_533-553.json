Serum bile acid is the earliestand most consistent parameter to increase in obstetric cholestasis.Serum cholic acid is preferred compared to serum chenodeoxycholic acid.Although serum bile acid increases after meals it is still considered an important investigationamong women with obstetric cholestasis. This is because serum bile acid levels remainsignificantly elevated in women with obstetric cholestasis in comparison to pregnant womenwithout it.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The risk of developing fetal varicella syndrome (congenital varicella syndrome) is highest whenthe mother develops varicella infection between 13 to 20 weeks.Congenital varicella syndrome occurs in 2% of infants with maternal varicella between 13 and 20weeks of gestation and in 0.4% of infants before 13 weeks of gestation. It is rare after 20 weeks.Congenital varicella syndrome is characterized by cicatricial skin scarring in a zoster-like pattern(zig-zag scarring), and limb hypoplasia (shown below). They can also present with neurologicalabnormalities (microcephaly, cortical atrophy, mental retardation), ophthalmic features(chorioretinitis, microphthalmia, cataract), and renal and autonomic system abnormalities(hydronephrosis, neurogenic bladder). Low birth weight is also common.Infants born to mothers with varicella in the period from 5 days prior to delivery up to 2 daysafter delivery are at high risk for severe neonatal varicella. They acquire the infectiontransplacentally.Since the mother has not developed a strong antibody response, the infant lacks the protectiveeffect of maternal anti-varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibodies. Therefore varicella-zoster immuneglobulin (VZIG) should be administered as soon as possible after birth to newborns whosemothers have varicella 5 days before and up to 2 days after the delivery.Since perinatally acquired varicella can be potentially life-threatening, the infant should typicallybe treated with intravenous acyclovir (10 mg/kg every 8 hours) when lesions appear.For pregnant women with uncomplicated primary varicella or herpes zoster that does not requirehospitalization, the recommended treatment is oral acyclovir (800 mg five times daily for sevendays).548",
