      "explanation": "Vaginal itching is not seen in bacterial vaginosis. It is a symptom of Trichomonas vaginitis.About half of the women having bacterial vaginosis are asymptomatic. Symptomatic womenmostly present with a profuse, fishy vaginal discharge. It does not cause pruritus, dysuria, anddyspareunia.Option A: Bacterial vaginosis occurs due to the absence of lactobacilli. This causes an increase inthe growth of other anaerobic bacteria namely Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus, and Myco-plasma hominis.Option B: Amsel's criteria is used for diagnosing bacterial vaginosis. 3 out of 4 criteria are neededto make a positive diagnosis.Option D: Oral metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days or oral clindamycin 300 mg twicedaily for 7 days is given for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
