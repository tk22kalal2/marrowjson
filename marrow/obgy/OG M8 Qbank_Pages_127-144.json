      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The ideal number of antenatal visits is 12-14. The antenatal visits should ideally be: monthly once up to 28 weeks, once in two weeks between 28-36 weeks, and once weekly visits from 36 weeks onwards. This translates to a total of 12-15 visits. The WHO increased the minimum number of antenatal visits from 4 to 8 visits to reduce perinatal mortality. In the Indian scenario, the earlier minimum of 4 visits were implemented as follows: 1st visit: within 12 weeks (preferably as soon as pregnancy is suspected); 2nd visit: between 14-26 weeks; 3rd visit: between 28-34 weeks; 4th visit: between 36 weeks and term. A booked case is one that has at least 3 antenatal visits with two visits in the third trimester.",

        "D": "Multipara is a woman who has completed 2 or more pregnancies past the period of viability"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "If a female has a stillbirth, her parity does not decrease. Parity is determined by the number of previous pregnancies reaching a period of viability, which is 28 weeks in India. Multifetal pregnancies, such as twins or triplets, count as one for the purpose of this notation. The current pregnancy is not included in this count. Multipara refers to a woman who has completed two or more pregnancies past the period of viability. When the pregnancy is preceded by five or more previous viable pregnancies, the woman is called a grand multipara. Note: Gravida indicates the number of times the mother has been pregnant, regardless of whether these pregnancies were carried to term. The current pregnancy is included in this count.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The obstetric score is G4 P1 A2 L1. The obstetric score is used to summarize the past obstetric history as follows: • G - Gravidity, denoting the total number of pregnancies, including the present one. • P - Parity, denoting the total number of pregnancies crossing the period of viability. This includes both live births and stillbirths. The current pregnancy is not included. • A - Abortus or the number of pregnancies that were lost for any reason, including induced abortions or miscarriages. • L - Living children. Multifetal pregnancies count as one for both gravida and para. A pregnant woman who delivers twins will be expressed as primipara. The GTPAL system includes the following: • Gravida, • Term (>37 weeks), • Preterm (20w-36w 6d), • Abortions (<20 weeks), and • Number of living children.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The woman has had two pregnancies in total - the previous twin pregnancy and the current pregnancy, hence the gravida score is 2. The first pregnancy resulted in delivery at term (crossed viable period), hence her para score is 1 (parity doesn't include current pregnancy). Hence, her obstetric score would be G2P1 (Gravida - 2, Para 1). Multifetal pregnancies count as one for both gravida and para. A pregnant woman who delivers twins for the first time is expressed as primipara. The obstetric score is used to summarize the past obstetric history as follows: • G- Gravidity, denoting the total number of pregnancies, including the present one • P - Parity, denoting the total number of pregnancies crossing the period of viability. This includes both live births and stillbirths. The current pregnancy is not included. • A - Abortion is the termination of pregnancy, either spontaneous or induced, before fetal viability. • L - Living children. The GTPAL system includes the following: • Gravida • Term (>37 weeks) • Preterm (20w-36w 6d) • Abortions (<20 weeks) • Number of living children.

        "C": "October 19",
        "D": "September 19"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "As per Naegele's rule, the EDD (expected date of delivery) of this woman is October 16, 2017. Naegele's rule states that EDD is obtained by adding 7 days and subtracting 3 months from the LMP (the 1st day of the last menstrual period). Another method is adding 9 months and 7 days to LMP. Less than 5% of births follow Naegele's rule. It is based on a 28-day regular cycle. If the cycle is shorter or longer than 28 days, the corrected EDD is calculated as follows: • For a 35-day cycle, add another 7 (35-28=7) days to the calculated EDD to get the corrected EDD. • For a 25-day cycle, subtract 3 (28-25=3) days from the calculated EDD to get the corrected EDD. Naegele's rule cannot be followed in IVF pregnancies. Considering the human embryo takes 266 days to develop, EDD is calculated in IVF pregnancies by the following method: • Same day as fertilization (day 0): EDD = date of transfer + 266 days • 3 days after fertilization (day 3): EDD = date of transfer + 263 days • 5 days after fertilization (day 5): EDD = date of transfer + 261 days",

        "C": "Continue same diet",
        "D": "600"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The pregnant lady can continue the same diet since there are no additional calorie requirements in the first trimester. Pregnancy requires an additional 80,000 kcal, mostly during the last 20 weeks. To meet this demand, a caloric increase of 100 to 300 kcal/d is recommended during pregnancy. This greater intake, however, should not be divided equally during the course of pregnancy. The Institute of Medicine (2006) recommends adding 0, 340, and 452 kcal/d to the estimated nonpregnant energy requirements in the first, second, and third trimesters respectively. Whenever caloric intake is inadequate, protein is metabolized rather than being spared for its vital role in fetal growth and development.",

      "question": "A 22-year-old pregnant woman at 13 weeks of gestation informs you about accidental exposure to radiation from a chest X-ray at 7 weeks of gestation. What should be the next step advised to her?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Continue pregnancy",
        "B": "Terminate pregnancy",
        "C": "Pre-invasive diagnostic test",
        "D": "Chromosome screening"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "In the given clinical case, the patient should be advised to continue the pregnancy. The radiation dose to the fetus during the declared term of pregnancy should be less than 1 mSv. In a chest X-ray PA view, the absorbed dose of radiation by the fetus is less than 0.1 mSv. Hence, pregnancy can be continued. An X-ray has a very limited role in obstetric imaging. There are very few indications where an X-ray will be useful: \n   • Fetal: congenital malformation of the fetus and neonates, skeletal malformations, birth injuries like fractures or dislocations.\n   • Maternal: Patients having cardiopulmonary disease may require an X-ray chest during pregnancy and that should be done beyond 12 weeks.\n   Radiation can cause fetal morbidity (FGR, genetic mutations, neurologic abnormalities, mental retardation, childhood leukemia) and mortality. The risks are high with radiation after the first 2 weeks postconception and within the first trimester (period of organogenesis).\n   Radiation during pregnancy can damage the early phase of the embryo but the risk can be minimized by using the '10-day rule'. This rule states that no woman should be exposed to an X-ray for a non-urgent indication outside 10 days from her last period during the reproductive period unless the pregnancy is excluded.\n   The given table below shows the absorbed radiation by the fetus in different diagnostic radiation procedures:\n   1 cGy = 10 mSv\n   1. Procedure    Abdominal X-ray    Dose (cGy)    0.1-0.3\n   2. Pelvic X-ray    0.5-1.1\n   3. Chest X-ray    <0.001\n   4. Abdominal CT    0.4-0.8\n   5. Chest CT    0.002-0.02\n   6.

      "explanation": "Preconceptional intake of vitamin B9 (folic acid) results in decreased incidence of neural tubedefects like spina bifida, encephalocele, and anencephaly.All women of reproductive age should be given 400 μg of folic acid daily. Women, who had fetalneural tube defects in the previous pregnancy, should be given 4 mg of folic acid daily beginning 1month before conception to about 12 weeks of pregnancy.",

      "explanation": "Beta-hCG levels are reduced in the case of spontaneous abortion.Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is detectable in the plasma of pregnant women as early as7-8 days after conception by radioimmunoassay. It doubles every 2 days and reaches a maximumlevel at 9 weeks. Thereafter, it declines to reach the lower level at 20 weeks and disappears fromcirculation 2 weeks postpartum.Increased levels of beta-hCG are found in:• Multiple pregnancies• Rh isoimmunization• Down's syndrome• Choriocarcinoma•Hydatidiform moleDecreased levels of beta-hCG are found in:• Ectopic pregnancies• Impending spontaneous abortion143• Missed abortion• Edward syndrome.",
