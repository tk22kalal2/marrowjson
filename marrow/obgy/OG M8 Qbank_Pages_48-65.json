She is obese with a male distribution of hair. Subfertile, with dysmenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, or irregular periods. There is an increased incidence of pre-eclampsia and a tendency for postmaturity. The pelvis is of the android type. The occipito-posterior position is common. During labor, there is a tendency for deep transverse arrest or outlet dystocia, leading to difficult instrumental delivery or cesarean section. There is a chance of lactation failure.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Face to pubis delivery is most commonly associated with anthropoid pelvis. As the anthropoid pelvis is wider posteriorly, the fetal occiput occupies the posterior segment of the pelvis. Thus, the fetus is present in the occipitoposterior position, which leads to a high chance of face-to-pubis delivery.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The interspinous diameter is the smallest transverse pelvic diameter. The interspinous diameter or bispinous diameter is measured in the mid pelvis. It is the distance between the tips of two ischial spines. Normally, it is 10-10.5 cm. It is useful in predicting obstructed labor. If the interspinous diameter is too small, the baby's head may get stuck at a higher station. Note: The obstetric conjugate is the smallest anteroposterior pelvic diameter, measuring 10 cm.",

Anteroposterior diameters of the pelvis: • True conjugate or the anteroposterior diameter extends from the uppermost margin of the symphysis pubis to the sacral promontory. It is normally 11 cm. • Obstetrical conjugate is the shortest distance between the sacral promontory and the symphysis pubis. It is normally 10 cm. It is estimated indirectly by subtracting 1.5–2 cm from the diagonal conjugate. • Diagonal conjugate is determined by measuring the distance from the lowest margin of the symphysis to the sacral promontory.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "In the given case scenario, a trial of labor or vaginal delivery can be allowed if the obstetric conjugate is 10 cm or more. The obstetric conjugate is the shortest distance between the sacral promontory and the symphysis pubis. Normally, it is 10 cm or more. The diagonal conjugate measures 12 cm and the true conjugate measures 11 cm. Clinically, only the diagonal conjugate is assessed by measuring the distance between the base of the examiner's fingers and the fingertip touching the sacral promontory. This determines the lowest margin of the symphysis to the sacral promontory. The obstetric conjugate is estimated indirectly by subtracting 1.5–2 cm from the diagonal conjugate. Note: Overt diabetes can cause fetal macrosomia during pregnancy. Thus, it may lead to cephalopelvic disproportion.",

In it, the pelvis is transversely contracted and the alae on both sides are absent, and the sacrum is fused with the innominate bones. Option A: In Naegele's pelvis, there is arrested development of one ala of the sacrum. Option C: Kyphotic pelvis occurs secondary to the kyphotic changes of the vertebral column, either following tuberculosis or rickets.

The pelvic inlet is considered to be contracted if: the greatest transverse diameter is < 12 cm or the shortest anteroposterior diameter is < 10 cm. The anteroposterior diameters of the pelvic inlet are the true conjugate, diagonal conjugate, and obstetric conjugate. These extend between the sacral promontory and symphysis pubis. The obstetric conjugate is the shortest diameter, normally measuring 10 cm. The transverse diameter of the pelvic inlet is at a right angle to the obstetric conjugate. It extends between the linea terminalis on either side. Normally, the transverse diameter is about 13 cm.",

Infants with cephalohematomas are at a heightened risk of developing jaundice because as the blood breaks down, the levels of bilirubin increase. Cephalohematoma is a collection of blood in between the pericranium and the flat bone (subperiosteal) of the skull, usually unilateral and over a parietal bone. It is never present at birth but gradually develops after 12-24 h. The swelling is limited by the suture lines of the skull as the pericranium is fixed to the margins of the bone.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given case scenario is suggestive of caput succedaneum, which disappears within 2-3 days. In vertex presentation, labor forces alter the shape of the fetal head. In prolonged labor, before complete cervical dilatation, the portion of the fetal scalp immediately over the cervical os becomes edematous. A swelling is formed due to the stagnation of fluid in the layers of the scalp beneath the girdle of contact. This is known as caput succedaneum. The swelling is diffuse, boggy, and not limited by the suture lines. It resolves spontaneously within 2-3 days after birth. It is a result of the static position of the head for a long period of time. Chignon is a type of artificial caput succedaneum, which is a swelling produced on the fetal head because of the scalp getting sucked into the cup during vacuum extraction.",
