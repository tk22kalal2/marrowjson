It begins 2 to 3 years beforemenopause and may continue 2-5 years after menopause. It marks the transition from active toinactive ovarian function and involves physical, sexual, and psychological adjustments.790The predictors of approaching menopause include:• A fall in the level of inhibin B and a corresponding rise in FSH level•A fall in the level of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) - This is a better marker of ovarian reserveand can be tested on any day of the cycle.",

In contrast, submucous leiomyomas often receive blood flow from multiplevessels (option A).Endometrial polyps are soft, fleshy growths within the uterus that consist of endometrial glands,fibrous stroma, and surface epithelium. Risk factors for endometrial polyps include increasingage, obesity, and tamoxifen use.They are usually asymptomatic. When symptomatic, they present with heavy menstrual bleeding,prolonged bleeding, intermenstrual bleeding, or infertility.The main diagnostic tools for endometrial polyps include transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) withapplied color Doppler, saline infusion sonography, and hysteroscopy.The risk factors for the malignant transformation include postmenopausal status, age older than60, and abnormal bleeding. Other factors such as larger polyp size (&gt;1.5 cm), tamoxifen use,diabetes, and obesity may also contribute to a higher risk.Hysteroscopic polypectomy may be considered most effective for symptomatic women or thosewith risk factors for malignant transformation.",

      "explanation": "Normal saline is the ideal fluid media used for bipolar electrocautery as it can function regardlessof the fluid electrolyte content.Normal saline and lactated Ringer solutions are commonly used isotonic, electrolyte-containingfluids in operating rooms for diagnostic hysteroscopy procedures. These solutions can causevolume overload and, if rapidly absorbed in large volumes, may lead to pulmonary edema.Isotonic, electrolyte-containing fluids are contraindicated for use with monopolar electrosurgicaldevices because they conduct electrical current, dissipate instrument energy and render theinstrument ineffective. Low-viscosity, electrolyte-poor fluids such as 1.5-percent glycine, 3-percentsorbitol, and 5-percent mannitol are preferred as they are non-conductive and can be safely usedwith monopolar electrosurgical energy devices.The primary risk of using hypotonic, hypoosmolar solutions is the intravascular absorption ofthese fluids, which can lead to acute hyponatremia and hypo osmolality.The criteria for terminating the procedure for electrolyte-deficient fluid is a deficit of 1 L andelectrolyte-rich fluid is a deficit of 2.5 L.796",
