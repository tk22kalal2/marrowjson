      "explanation": "The given image is suggestive of condyloma acuminata that shows cauliflower-like masses oftissue on and around the female anogenital region.Condyloma acuminatum is an epidermal manifestation of the human papillomavirus (HPV).HPV is transmitted through contact with infected skin or mucosa. The virus invades the cells ofthe epidermal basal layer through microabrasions. However, anogenital HPV infection is almostalways acquired through sexual contact.Warts are not required for transmission but are highly infectious because of their high viral load.Option B: The image given below shows shiny, pearly white, umbilicated papules with acharacteristic dimple at the centre. These are seen in molluscum contagiosum caused by the poxvirus.Molluscum contagiosumPearly white wart-like umbilicated papules722Option C: The image given below shows firm papules with a rough horny surface. These are seenin verruca vulgaris caused by the human papillomavirus type 2.DAILYROUNDSOption D: The image given below shows condyloma lata which is the characteristic feature ofsecondary syphilis. It is caused by Treponema pallidum.",

Anorectal involvement causes proctocolitis and causes rectal strictures.
