      "explanation": "The round ligament terminates at the anterior end of the labia majora. The labia majora lie on either side of the vulva and join posteriorly to form the posterior commissure. The inner side is hairless. Labia majora are homologous to the scrotum in males. The labia majora and the mons veneris contain: hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and modified sweat glands, known as apocrine glands. The labia minora are two cutaneous folds between the labia majora. Anteriorly they enclose the clitoris and unite with each other in front and behind the clitoris to form the prepuce and frenulum respectively. The labia minora are homologous to the ventral aspect of the penis. The clitoris is a small erectile body lying in the anterior-most part of the vulva. The clitoris is homologous to the glans penis.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given image shows a Bartholin's cyst, which involves the Bartholin's glands. These glands are homologous to the male bulbourethral or Cowper glands. The ducts of Bartholin's glands open in the groove between the hymen and the labia minora at approximately 5 and 7 o'clock positions. They are stimulated by sexual arousal. The glands contain columnar cells that secrete mucus with lubricant properties. Contraction of the bulbospongiosus muscle expresses gland secretions. Bartholin's cyst occurs due to obstruction of the ducts of the Bartholin's glands by proteinaceous material, or due to infection. Symptomatic or recurrent cysts may require marsupialization or gland excision. An infected Bartholin's cyst can lead to a Bartholin's abscess. This requires surgical drainage.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The pH of the vagina before puberty is 7. In adult females, the pH is acidic. Doderlein's bacilli (Lactobacillus sp.) are part of the normal vaginal flora. They produce lactic acid from glycogen in the vaginal epithelium and make the vaginal pH acidic. They are present in newborns and disappear in 10-14 days. They reappear at puberty and disappear after menopause. Vaginal flora also includes microbes such as Clostridium welchii. Vaginal defense mechanisms are influenced by estrogen. In newborns, maternal estrogens maintain the defense mechanisms for 10-14 days. After that, the levels wane. During puberty, the circulating estrogen maintains the defense mechanism. Note: The pH is higher in the upper part of the vagina due to mixing with alkaline cervical mucus. Period: Birth-2 weeks, Vaginal pH: 4-5, Doderlein bacteria: +2 weeks-puberty >7, Types of cells: Parabasal cells. At puberty: 4-4.5, Reproductive, 4-5, sparse/plenty, Superficial & intermediate.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The uterine artery above and uterine venous plexus below are likely to be damaged here, as the ureter is present between these vessels. The ureter pierces the Mackenrodt's ligament, forming the ureteric canal. In this canal, the ureter is crossed by the uterine artery above and the uterine plexus of veins below, thus being present between the uterine vessels. The ureteric canal provides the necessary room for normal peristalsis, without pressure from the surrounding structures. After leaving the ureteric canal, the ureter passes forwards and medially to reach the bladder. It is 1-2 cm away from the cervix.",

Structure of the ovary: • Surface epithelium - a single layer of cuboidal cells is present, which later gives rise to the surface epithelium of the adult ovary. It is morphologically continuous with the mesothelium of the peritoneum. • The subepithelial connective tissue layer - gives rise to the tunica albuginea of the adult ovary and the basement membrane beneath the surface epithelium. • The parenchymatous zone - becomes the cortex and contains the egg nests and ovarian follicles. • Zona vasculosa - becomes the medulla and contains the blood vessels. Hilar cells present here are homologous to interstitial cells of testes. They can rarely produce hilar cell tumors of the ovary.

      "explanation": "Call-Exner bodies are formed by granulosa cells present within the granulosa cell layer of the ovary. They are small, distinctive, gland-like structures filled with acidophilic material, resembling immature follicles. They are characteristically seen in granulosa cell tumors of the ovary. The image below shows Call-Exner bodies (circled in black). Graafian follicle: The mature Graafian follicle is spheroidal or ovoid in shape. It contains pent-up secretion known as the liquor folliculi. The lining consists of: • Theca externa • Theca interna - contain the theca cells • Granulosa cell layer • Cumulus oophorus - projection of granulosa cells into the cavity of the Graafian follicle.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The efferent preganglionic sympathetic fibres to the ovary are derived from the T10-T11 spinal levels. These fibres travel to the prevertebral ganglia, where they synapse. The postganglionic sympathetic fibres arising from these ganglia contribute to the ovarian plexus, which innervates the ovary. The ovarian plexus is a network of nerves comprising: postganglionic sympathetic fibres, preganglionic parasympathetic fibres from the sacral outflow (S2-S4), and visceral afferent fibres (responsible for transmitting sensory signals). The ovarian plexus has two parts based on its connections: the upper part, derived from branches of the renal plexus and aortic plexus, and the lower part, derived from the superior and inferior hypogastric plexuses.",

      "explanation": "In the given case scenario, blood flow in the vaginal artery will not be affected, as it is not a branch of the uterine artery. The vaginal artery is a branch of the anterior division of the internal iliac artery. It is homologous to the inferior vesical artery in males. It supplies the vagina and the base of the bladder in women. It should not be confused with vaginal branches of the uterine artery. Branches of the uterine artery: • Ureteric branch • Vaginal branches (descending) - these unite to form the anterior and posterior azygos arteries of the vagina • Circular cervical branch • Sampson's artery - it runs under the round ligament. It represents the anastomosis of the uterine artery and ovarian artery. • Arcuate -> Radial -> Basal -> Spiral and straight arterioles of the functional layer of the endometrium. Aorta.

      "explanation": "The space of Retzius is the other name for prevesical or retropubic space. Burch colposuspension is a procedure done to relieve stress urinary incontinence. If an extraperitoneal approach is selected, the retropubic space is entered by perforating the transversalis fascia layer of the anterior abdominal wall. Once the retropubic space is dissected, the bladder neck and the vaginal fascia underneath are identified. The bladder is mobilized to the opposite side. At each side of the bladder neck, two to four, preferably non-absorbable sutures are placed in the space of Retzius. Note: The presacral space is a retroperitoneal space that lies between the peritoneum of the posterior abdominal wall and the sacrum. It contains the superior and inferior hypogastric plexuses. The sacral sympathetic trunk lies against the sacrum's ventral surface.",
