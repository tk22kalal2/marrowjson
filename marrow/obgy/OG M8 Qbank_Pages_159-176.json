      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In the second trimester, the parameter to assess gestational age most accurately is the biparietal diameter (BPD). Accuracy varies from 7 to 10 days. BPD is measured in the transthalamic view, at the level of the thalamus and cavum septum pellucidum (CSP). It is measured from the outer edge of the skull in the near field to the inner edge of the skull in the far field. Trimester Parameters: First - Crown-rump length (CRL), Second - Biparietal diameter (BPD), Third - Femur length (FL)",

      "explanation": "The red arrowhead represents the decidua capsularis. The yellow arrowhead shows the double ring - outer decidua parietalis and inner decidua capsularis. It is referred to as the double decidua sign and is seen in the first trimester transvaginal sonogram. It is useful to confirm an early intrauterine location for the pregnancy.",

        "D": "Continue steroids until term"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The umbilical artery Doppler depicts reversal of end-diastolic flow or REDF (waves appearing below the baseline) which is seen in intrauterine growth restriction. As the period of gestation has exceeded 32 weeks, the pregnancy can be terminated. In case of absent end-diastolic flow (AEDF), the waves just touch the baseline, but don't appear below it. This suggests a fetal compromise, hence the pregnancy is terminated by C-section if >34 weeks. Reversed end-diastolic flow (REDF) suggests impending fetal death, hence the pregnancy is terminated by C-section if >32 weeks. Patterns of end-diastolic flow in the umbilical artery: Normal diastolic flow, Absence of end-diastolic flow, Reversal of end-diastolic flow.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The accuracy of determining gestational age using ultrasound is the highest in the first trimester and decreases afterwards. Option A: Gestational sac is reliably seen at 5 weeks of gestation on transvaginal sonography (TVS). Option C: The first sign of pregnancy seen on sonography is the gestational sac. Visualization of the yolk sac within the gestational sac confirms an intrauterine location for pregnancy. Option D: A normal gestational sac implants eccentrically in the endometrium, whereas a pseudosac is seen in the midline of the endometrial cavity.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Nuchal translucency evaluation, a component of first-trimester aneuploidy screening, is done between 11-14 weeks. It represents the maximum thickness of the subcutaneous translucent area between the skin and soft tissue, overlying the fetal spine, at the back of the neck. When the nuchal translucency is increased, the risk of fetal aneuploidy and structural anomalies such as heart defects is significantly elevated. First-trimester aneuploidy screening combines two maternal serum analytes and a sonographic measurement: Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) and Nuchal translucency (NT). It is performed between 11 and 14 weeks of gestation. In cases of fetal Down syndrome, the first-trimester serum-free β-hCG level is higher and the PAPP-A level is lower. With trisomy 18 and trisomy 13, levels of both analytes are lower. Note: Nuchal fold is a normal fold of skin seen at the back of the fetal neck during the second trimester of pregnancy. Increased nuchal fold thickness is associated with fetal aneuploidy.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given ultrasound image shows an open defect in the calvaria and skin leading to the exposure of the cranial neural tube. This is consistent with the diagnosis of anencephaly. Anencephaly results from incomplete closure of the neural tube. It is one of the earliest detectable congenital defects that can be detected as early as 10 to 11 weeks of gestation. Screening can also be done by serum estimation of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP). The following are the radiological signs seen in anencephaly. \n   Frog eye sign - Absence of cranial calvaria, prominent orbits thereby resembling the face of a frog. \n   Shower cap sign - The absence of the cranium could lead to the protrusion of a disorganized mass of brain tissue. This resembles a shower cap giving rise to a characteristic triangular facial appearance.\n   Neural-tube defects can be prevented with pre-conceptional supplementation of folic acid. A dose of 4 mg daily is recommended in subsequent pregnancies.\n   Option B: Omphalocele is a midline anterior abdominal wall defect through which the solid abdominal viscera and/or bowel may herniate. The extruded abdominal contents are covered in a sac. \n   Cystic hygroma is a congenital multiloculated lymphatic lesion that is classically found in the left posterior triangle of the neck. It occurs as a result of sequestration or obstruction of developing lymph vessels. This defect can be picked up in a first-trimester ultrasound.\n   Encephalocele is caused due to defects in the skull through which the meninges and/or neural tissue herniate. The squamous part of the occipital bone is the most frequently affected bone.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Absent end diastolic flow indicates fetal compromise in Doppler. Umbilical artery vessels: They are characterized by forward low-resistance flow. As gestation increases, there is a gradual fall in all the resistance indices, so the amount of forward diastolic flow increases. The S/D ratio decreases as the period of gestation increases. Abnormal flow patterns in umbilical artery: Reduced end-diastolic flow - uteroplacental insufficiency (systolic/diastolic ratio increases). Absent end-diastolic flow - fetal compromise (hence pregnancy is terminated by cesarean section if >34 weeks). Reverse end-diastolic flow - impending death (pregnancy is terminated irrespective of gestational age). Doppler of the middle cerebral artery helps in detecting fetal anemia. Increased fetal diastolic flow in the middle cerebral artery with absent diastolic flow in the aorta implies fetal acidemia. Patterns of end-diastolic flow in the umbilical artery: Normal diastolic flow, absence of end-diastolic flow, reversal of end-diastolic flow.",
