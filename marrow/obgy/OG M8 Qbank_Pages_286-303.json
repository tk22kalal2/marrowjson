Patients with SS have varying degrees of anterior pituitary hormone deficiency.The hyperplastic enlargement of the pituitary, which occurs normally during pregnancy, increasesthe risk of infarction.Affected women may have persistent hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and lactationfailure. The most prominent symptoms are lactation failure (due to a deficiency ofprolactin) and postpartum amenorrhea (due to a deficiency of gonadotropins). Becausedeficiencies of some or all pituitary-responsive hormones may develop after the initial insult,Sheehan syndrome can be heterogeneous and may not be identified for years.It can present acutely as pituitary apoplexy, an endocrine emergency, characterized by a suddenonset of headache, nausea, visual deficits, and in severe cases,severe hypoglycemia, hypotension and shock, CNS hemorrhage, and death.Also, it can present late with the following features:• Loss of pubic and axillary hair⚫ Hypothyroidism due to decreased TSH secretion•Adrenal insufficiency due to low ACTHTreatment is by hormone replacement - first glucocorticoids, later - thyroid hormone, sex steroids,vasopressin and growth hormones are given. If there is evidence of progressive visual loss, cranialnerve involvement or loss of consciousness, immediate surgical decompression must be carriedout. Fertility can be achieved in these women with hMG and hCG. Clomiphene is ineffective.Option B: Rotor syndrome is a type of hereditary hyperbilirubinemia with autosomal recessiveinheritance. Affected individuals have mild jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia.Option C: Prolactinoma or pituitary adenoids is the condition of hyperprolactinemia diagnosed bya prolactin level &gt;200 µg/L. It usually presents with infertility, amenorrhea, and galactorrhea.Option D: Acromegaly is characterized by the signs and symptoms pertaining to excessive growthhormone secretion.",
