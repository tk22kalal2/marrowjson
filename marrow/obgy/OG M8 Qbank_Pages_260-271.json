      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The image shows Wrigley's forceps, which is a type of outlet forceps. Rotation of the fetal headshould not exceed 45 degrees for the application of outlet forceps. This is because it increases therisk of vaginal wall lacerations.",

      "explanation": "Forceps can be used for delivery of the aftercoming head of breech. The advantages are as follows:• Delivery can be controlled by giving pull directly on the head and the force is not transmittedthrough the neck.•Flexion is better maintained.• Mucus can be sucked out from the mouth more effectively.•Prerequisites for instrumental vaginal delivery:• Ruptured membranes vertex presentationCephalopelvic disproportion not suspected• No fetal coagulopathy or bone demineralization disorder• Completely dilated cervix•Precisely assessed fetal head position•Engaged head•Experienced operatorNote: Ventouse can be used for occipitotranverse or posterior position.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Minor scalp abrasions and subgaleal hematomas in newborns are more frequently seen withventouse delivery than with forceps delivery.Maternal morbidity is seen more with forceps deliveries and perinatal morbidity is seen more withvacuum deliveries.Maternal morbidity seen in operative vaginal deliveries include:•Increased third and fourth-degree vaginal lacerations•Pelvic floor disorders• Postpartum hemorrhagePerinatal morbidity seen in operative vaginal deliveries include:• Vacuum-assisted perinatal injuries: Cephalohematoma, subgaleal hemorrhage, retinalhemorrhage, neonatal jaundice secondary to these hemorrhages, shoulder dystocia, clavicularfracture, intracranial hemorrhage, and scalp lacerations.• Forceps-assisted perinatal injuries: Higher rates of facial nerve injury, brachial plexus injury,depressed skull fracture, and corneal abrasion.In cardiac patients, vaginal delivery is preferred. It is conducted with the laboring woman in anupright or left decubitus position. Prophylactic use of vacuum is done to cut short the secondstage of labor. This is to minimize aortocaval compression. Caesarean section is not preferredsince it is associated with more blood loss and higher thromboembolic and infection risk.267",

      "explanation": "Deep transverse arrest is an indication for ventouse delivery.In ventouse delivery technique, suction is created within a cup placed on the fetal scalp such thattraction on the cup aids fetal expulsion. The important step in ventouse extraction is proper cupplacement over the flexion point.The vacuum is gradually created by increasing the suction in increments of 0.2 kg/cm2 every 2minutes until a total negative pressure of 0.8 kg/cm2 is reached.

This is generated by increasing the suction inincrements of 0.2 kg/cm2 every 2 minutes. This is done until a total negative pressure of 0.8kg/cm2 is reached.This slow incremental approach would allow for a more firm attachment of the vacuum cup to thefetal head and thereby a lower failure rate.",
