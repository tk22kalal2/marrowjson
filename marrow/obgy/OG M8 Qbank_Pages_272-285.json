      "explanation": "According to ACOG guidelines, the ideal time to administer antibiotics is within a time period of60 mins prior to the planned caesarean section.Antimicrobial administration before surgical incision has been shown to lower postoperativeinfection rates without adverse neonatal effects, as compared with drug administration afterumbilical cord clamping. A 1 g dose of cefazolin is an efficacious and cost-effective choice.For emergency delivery, antibiotic prophylaxis should be given as soon as possible.",

      "explanation": "The above partogram is suggestive of obstructed labour and the definitive management in thiscase is caesarean section. Cefazolin is an efficacious and cost-effective choice for antibioticprophylaxis before caesarean section.According to the partogram, there is a secondary arrest of dilatation for &gt;2 hours and arrest ofdescent for &gt;1 hour. The amniotic fluid is stained with meconium and there is fall in fetal heartrate indicating fetal distress. Hence, the management plan is to perform a caesarean section.The recommended prophylactic drug is a single intravenous dose of a ß-lactam antimicrobial. Thiscould either be a cephalosporin or an extended-spectrum penicillin derivative. A 1 g dose ofcefazolin is usually given. For obese women, a 2 g dose is better to provide an adequate coverage.",

However, endocarditis prophylaxis is not required if the patient isalready receiving intrapartum prophylaxis with broad-spectrum antibiotics to preventendometritis.Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for atrial septal defect (ASD). The risk of endocarditiswith ASD is negligible. Bacterial endocarditis is associated with unrepaired ventricular septal279defects where antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended.

It is also known as the Mackenrodt incision.The various incisions mentioned in the image are:-Incision '1' Midline vertical incision is made in the middle extending from just below theumbilicus to just above the symphysis pubis. This is used less commonly compared to thetransverse abdominal incision.-Incision '3' Joel Cohen is a straight incision higher than the Pfannenstiel incision. The fascia wasincised transversely in the midline then extended laterally with blunt finger dissection; fingerdissection was used to separate the rectus muscles vertically and laterally.-Incision '4' Pfannenstiel incision is the most common incision made in caesarean delivery. Itfollows Langer lines of skin tension. A transverse and slightly curvilinear incision is made in theskin and subcutaneous tissue 3 cm above the superior border of the pubic symphysis.280This is stretched laterally for 12-15 cm to accommodate the delivery of the fetus. Following this,the rectus sheath is incised transversely and rectus muscles are separated in the middle to gainentry to the peritoneum.Abdominal incisions for caesarean sectionOMARROWMidline verticalMaylardJoel CohenPfannenstiel",
