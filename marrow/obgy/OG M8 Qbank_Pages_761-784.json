FSH levels are measured in the earlyfollicular phase on day 2 or 3 of the menstrual cycle.A high FSH level indicates that the ovarian reserve is getting depleted and fewer oocytes arepresent in the ovary. FSH is high in ovarian hypofunction and postmenopausal women.Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is a better marker than FSH for ovarian reserve. Unlike FSH, itslevels can be estimated at any time of the cycle. AMH is produced by the granulosa cells in ovarianfollicles.Note: Studies show that AMH levels decrease under the current use of oral contraceptive pills andtobacco smoking.",

The distinction lies in the shape of the uterine fundus, which is usually not visible on HSG.An ultrasound or MRI should be done to differentiate between these conditions if intervention isplanned.RThe hysterosalpingogram given below shows filling defects:",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Fertiloscopy helps in obtaining a good view of the posterior surface (and not the anterior surface)of the ovary and genital organs. This is an advantage of fertiloscopy over laparoscopy.The other advantages of fertiloscopy over laparoscopy are:781• The Trendelenburg position is not needed. The procedure can be done in a lithotomy position• Trauma can be avoided as no trocar is needed• No CO2: Hydroperitoneum with saline• Peritoneal spill can be seenFertiloscopy is a new mini-invasive diagnostic technique that allows the visualization of theposterior pelvis. In this technique, an optical device is introduced into the pouch of Douglas,through the posterior vaginal fornix, under general/local anaesthesia.It can also be used for small interventions, such as adhesiolysis, ovarian drilling, coagulation ofendometriosis spots and to perform chromosalpingoscopy and salpingoscopy. With fertiloscopy,surgical intervention can be avoided and it is a good alternative to diagnostic laparoscopy.The image given below is of a fertiloscope.FTO 1.40ystperativeFertiloscopy",

      "question": "A 26-year-old woman underwent a workup for primary infertility. On hysterosalpingography,there was a bilateral cornual block. What is the next step in management?",

        "A": "Tuboplasty",

        "C": "Hydrotubation",
        "D": "In-vitro fertilization768"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In the given clinical scenario, the next step in management will be hysteroscopy andlaparoscopy-guided surgery.Tubal contractions, particularly cornual spasms, can give an incorrect impression of proximalfallopian tube obstruction (a false-positive result) on hysterosalpingography. Laparoscopy withchromotubation is therefore considered to confirm the diagnosis of cornual spasm. Laparoscopy isboth diagnostic and therapeutic in this condition.Hysteroscopy is an operative procedure that provides an endoscopic view of the endometrialcavity and tubal ostia via the cervix, performed in the preovulatory phase. It canbe diagnostic or therapeutic. It is the gold standard investigation for visualizing the uterine cavityand tubal ostia.•Contraindications to hysteroscopy are as follows:• Acute genital tract infection (Eg: genital herpes infection)782• Viable intrauterine pregnancy•⚫ During menstruation, the view is obscured, and the infection rate is high.• Scarred uterus and enlarged uterus of size ≥ 12 weeks are relative contraindications.• Cervical stenosis can cause cervical tears and uterine perforation.•Cardiopulmonary disorder due to increased risk of fluid overload and pulmonary edema.Known cases of cervical cancerLaparoscopy is the gold standard for the evaluation of tubal factors in infertility, commonly donein the proliferative phase. It can be diagnostic or therapeutic.•Benefits of laparoscopic evaluation:Tubes: For detection of tubal patency, block (site and side), motility, hydrosalpinx change,peritubal adhesions, fimbrial agglutination• Ovaries: PCOS changes, endometriosis, PID, adhesions•• Uterus: Anomalies, fibroids• Peritoneal factors: Adhesions, PID, endometriosis, tuberculosis• Therapy at the same sitting (as appropriate)Therapeuticindications of hys Diagnosticindications of hystteroscopyUterine septumAsherman syndrome Retained IUCDPolypectomySubmucous fibroidAbnormal uterine bleeding Tuba1 sterilization using sclerosing agentseroscopyTo study the endocervical mucosal liningCongenital malformations of the uterusEndometrial tuberculosisMisplaced IUCDEndometrial lesionsEndometrial polypAsherman syndromeCornual tubal blockageDiagnosticAge >35 years History of pelvic pain, dyspareunia, pelvic surgery, adhesionsAbnormal HSGFailure to conceive after areasonable period (6 months)with normal HSGWomen with comorbid pelvic pathology(PID, endometriosis)Therapeutic (Operative)Unexplained infertilityReconstructive tubal surgeryAdhesiolysis Fulguration of endometriotic implantsOvarian drilling in PCOSGIFT and ZIFT procedures",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The best line of management for the given patient is human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG)followed by hCG.783The patients who have undergone hypophysectomy i.e. removal of the pituitary gland, can notproduce endogenous gonadotropins. Exogenous gonadotropins such as hMG are given to suchpatients. Timed administration of hCG is needed to induce ovulation after the follicle hasmatured.The human menopausal gonadotropin is an extract of urine from postmenopausal women. Itcontains FSH and LH in the required ratio for follicular growth.Clomiphene, letrozole, and GnRH analogs stimulate the release of gonadotropins from thepituitary gland. These are not helpful in a patient whose pituitary gland has been removed.784",
