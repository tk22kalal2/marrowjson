      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The sex of the fetus is determined by Yp11, which is a region present on the short arm of the Y chromosome. It contains the SRY gene, which produces the protein called the testis determining factor. This causes the gonads to develop into the testes. The target gene for SRY, which favors testis differentiation, is SOX9. If the SRY gene or Y chromosome are absent, the gonads develop as ovaries. The genes that favor this are: • Wnt4 • Rspo • DAX1",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Sexual differentiation of the fetus occurs only after the 7th week of development. The chromosomal and genetic sex of an embryo is determined at fertilization by the kind of sperm that fertilizes the ovum (X or Y). However, male and female morphological characteristics begin developing after the 7th week. At the end of the 6th week of development, it is impossible to distinguish between the two sexes.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "In a hysterosalpingogram, the uterine anomaly cannot be determined as the external contour of the uterus cannot be seen. Hysterosalpingography (HSG) provides excellent information about the interior contour of the uterine cavity. However, it doesn't show the external contour, so it cannot distinguish between uterine anomalies such as didelphys, bicornuate, septate or arcuate uteruses. Transvaginal 3-D ultrasonography (3D TV-US) is very accurate for the diagnosis and differentiation of uterine anomalies. It is the first and only mandatory step in the assessment of the uterine cavity in patients with a suspected uterine anomaly. Pelvic MRI without contrast provides excellent delineation of both internal and external uterine contours. It should be reserved for patients in whom 3D TV-US is not possible.",

        "C": "Hysterosalpingography",
        "D": "Ultrasonography"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Ultrasonography (USG) is performed to confirm a diagnosis of uterus didelphys. Uterine didelphys is a congenital condition that occurs when the incomplete fusion of Mullerian ducts that form the uterus during embryonic development leads to the development of two separate uterine cavities and two cervices, each with its own set of endometrial lining. It is commonly associated with renal anomalies such as unilateral renal agenesis, severe renal hypoplasia, etc., and is often associated with recurrent pregnancy loss, preterm labor, malpresentation, and prematurity. 3D ultrasound, a non-invasive test, visualizes both the external (serosal) and internal (endometrial) uterine contours, effectively identifying anomalies. Hysterosalpingography (Option C) shows only the internal contour, making it unable to distinguish between conditions like didelphys, bicornuate, septate, or arcuate uterus. The USG findings in didelphys uterus are two widely separated uterine horns and a deep fundal indentation. Laparoscopy and hysteroscopy, being invasive diagnostic procedures, should be reserved for cases where simultaneous surgical treatment is planned following a comprehensive non-invasive assessment of a Mullerian anomaly. (Option A) Intravenous pyelography is used to diagnose congenital renal anomalies. (Option B)",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Transcervical hysteroscopic resection of the septum has the best obstetric outcome. The procedure involves the resection of the septum under hysteroscopic guidance. Hence, it does not scar the uterus and avoids the necessity of cesarean sections for future pregnancies, improving obstetric outcomes. Metropexy is the surgical resection of the intrauterine septum. This is done by approaching the uterus transabdominally via three methods: Jones metropexy, Strassmann metropexy, and Tompkins metropexy. All of these methods are not preferred nowadays as they cause uterine scarring.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The sequence of pubertal changes in girls is thelarche → pubarche → menarche. Puberty marks the normal physiologic transition from childhood to sexual and reproductive maturity. The order of changes in puberty are: • Thelarche - It refers to breast budding, and is the first visible sign. It indicates the competency of the hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian axis. It appears between the age of 9-11 years, and is described using Tanner staging. • Adrenarche - It refers to the generation of androgens (estrogen and testosterone) from the adrenal gland. • Pubarche - It refers to the development of pubic hair, and occurs usually 6 months after thelarche. It is also described using Tanner staging. • Menarche - It refers to the first occurrence of menstruation. Growth spurt usually occurs between ages 10.5 to 13.5 years.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Pubarche or the development of axillary and pubic hair is not mediated by estrogen. It occurs due to testosterone in both sexes. Around 50% of testosterone comes from the ovaries and the rest from the adrenal gland. Puberty in girls involves breast development (thelarche), an increase in adrenal androgen secretion (adrenarche), and the beginning of menstrual cycles (menarche). Estrogen has the following actions during puberty: breast development, development of the reproductive tract, starting of menstruation (option D), increased fat in the hips, regulation of pubertal growth spurt, vaginal cornification (option C), cervical mucus production (option B), epiphyseal closure, and maintenance of bone formation - acts against parathyroid hormone.",

      "explanation": "The given case scenario is suggestive of an imperforate hymen, which has led tocryptomenorrhoea. This is a condition where menstruation occurs but is not visible due to anobstruction of the outflow tract.The menstrual fluid gets collected in the reproductive tract. When this collection occurs in thevagina, it is known as hematocolpos. If the collection extends to the uterus, it is known ashematometra. The collection of blood in the fallopian tubes is called hematosalpinx.The most common causes of cryptomenorrhea are:•Intact/imperforate hymen - a bluish convex bulge is seen.• Transverse vaginal septum - a pinkish concave covering is seenUltrasound pelvis confirms the diagnosis.Management:Imperforate hymen - A simple cruciate incision of the hymen allows the free drainage of thecollected menstrual blood, and leads to normal reproductive function.106Transverse vaginal septum - Extensive dissection and vaginoplasty is required.Option A: Bartholin's cyst appears as a swelling on the inner side of the labia majora. Larger cystscan bulge across the introitus. Small cysts can remain asymptomatic.Option D: Endometriomas are endometriotic lesions seen on the ovary. They present as adnexalmasses. Endometriosis is a complication in cryptomenorrhea, due to retrograde menstruation.",

Hence, the patient will have highLH and FSH levels as it is a condition of hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism.Gonadal dysgenesis is the most frequent cause of premature ovarian failure. In this disorder, anormal complement of germ cells is present in the early fetal ovary. However, oocytes undergoaccelerated atresia, and the ovary is replaced by a fibrous streak. This is called a streak gonad.There are two types of gonadal dysgenesis:1. Pure gonadal dysgenesis:••• Karyotypes seen:46 XX is seen in pure gonadal dysgenesis due to FSH gene mutation.• 46 XY - Swyer syndrome• Associated with primary amenorrhoea•They are phenotypically female due to:•Absence of testosterone••• Absence of Anti-Mullerian hormone secretion by testes⚫ The underdeveloped gonad ultimately fails, which is indicated by elevated gonadotropin (LH,FSH) levels• The presence of a Y chromosome can result in a germ cell tumor in the dysgenetic gonad• Treatment:•⚫ Hormone replacement therapy - with estrogen and progesterone•Infertility - Pregnancy can occur with a donated ovum2.
