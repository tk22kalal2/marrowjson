The hyperestrogenic environment is created by the following mechanisms:• Compared to normal myometrium, leiomyoma cells contain a greater density of estrogenreceptors, which results in greater estradiol binding.•These tumors convert less estradiol to the weaker estrone.• There are higher levels of cytochrome P450 aromatase in leiomyomas compared with normalmyocytes.

This is associated with fibroids in 3% of cases.Polymenorrhoea in a patient with fibroids occurs when she has polycystic ovaries or pelvicinflammatory disease (PID).Progressive menorrhagia is seen in intramural and submucous myoma due to increasedvascularity, endometrial hyperplasia, and an enlarged uterine cavity.Note: Further the distance of the fibroid from the cavity, lesser is the possibility of menorrhagia.For this reason, subserous and pedunculated fibroids do not cause menorrhagia.",

Due to increased vascularity inpregnancy, the fibroid increases in size and becomes softer. The torsion is seen in the subserouspedunculated fibroid where the venous return is blocked at its site of attachment in the uterus.This leads to severe acute abdominal pain. Due to the complication being more local thansystemic, fever or leucocytosis are generally not seen.A transvaginal ultrasonogram is immediately done to detect the position and size of the fibroid,which is followed by laparotomic myomectomy as a part of emergency surgical management.634Other options:Option A: Red degeneration of fibroid is seen commonly in the second half of pregnancy orpuerperium. It is due to a hemorrhagic infarction of the tissue and typically presents as acute focalabdominal pain with fever and leucocytosis. Treatment is usually conservative with bed rest,analgesics, and sedatives.Option B: Preterm labor is where the labor starts before 37 completed weeks. It is characterized bytrue labor pain.

      "explanation": "The given case scenario and ultrasound image showing a well-defined, heterogeneous hypoechoicmass are suggestive of a uterine fibroid. Misoprostol does not help to reduce the size of the fibroidand so is not recommended for its management.Medical management of fibroids helps to reduce their size. The drugs used in therapy are asfollows:• Antiprogesterone - Mifepristone / RU-486• GnRH analogs•Agonists goserelin, leuprorelin, nafarelin, buserelin-• Antagonists - cetrorelix, ganirelix•Levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system•Selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) - Asoprisnil• Danazol - usually not used due to androgenic side effects.",
