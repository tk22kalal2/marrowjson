      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "In a normal pregnancy, the remodeling of spiral arteries begins at 12 weeks.Remodeling of arteries includes invasion of arteries by trophoblasts that convert them fromlow-flow, high-resistance to high-flow, low-resistance vessels. These modified vessels are morecapable of meeting the demands of the developing fetus.Uteroplacental vessel development takes place in two stages:The first stage occurs before 12 weeks post-fertilization. During this stage, invasion of spiralarteries up to myometrium occurs.477The second stage occurs between 12-16 weeks. It involves invasion of the endovasculartrophoblasts into the intra-myometrial segments of spiral arteries. Interstitialtrophoblasts surround the arteries.Incomplete trophoblastic invasion leads to pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) where thevessels remain in a state of high resistance leading to placental ischemia and release ofinflammatory mediators and vasoactive substances leading to endothelial injury.As the second stage of invasion occurs by 18 weeks, PIH develops after 20 weeks of pregnancy.",

They increase months before clinical preeclampsiadevelops.• Soluble endoglin (sEng) is derived from the placenta and blocks endothelial nitricoxide-dependent vasodilatation. It also inhibits various TGFẞ isoforms from binding toendothelial receptors.•• Soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1) is a variant of the Flt-1 receptor for placental growthfactor (PlGF) and for VEGF. Increased maternal sFlt-1 levels inactivate and decrease circulatingfree PlGF and VEGF concentrations, leading to endothelial dysfunction.",

      "explanation": "Decreased GFR is seen in pre-eclampsia.During normal pregnancy, renal blood flow and GFR are increased. However, in pre-eclampsia,renal blood flow and GFR decrease due to increased renal afferent arteriolar resistance. Thehallmark renal lesion is glomerular endotheliosis. Diminished filtration causes serum creatininelevels and plasma uric acid concentration levels to rise. The elevation is also due to enhancedtubular reabsorption.The most common system involved in pre-eclampsia is the renal system.Several studies have demonstrated that pre-eclampsia is associated with low urinary calcium.

Functions of MgSO4 include:• Membrane protector and neuro stabilizer. It is used in the prevention of cerebral palsy in verylow birth weight neonates.• Reduction of motor endplate sensitivity to acetylcholine, and thus is used as an adjunct in themanagement of acute severe asthma in children and adults•Blocking of neuronal calcium influx, and is thus used in the conservative management ofpre-term labor (tocolytic, option D)• Inducing cerebral vasodilatation, dilating the uterine arteries, increasing the production ofendothelial prostacyclin, and inhibiting platelet activation. Hence it is used in the management ofpre-eclampsia (option A) and to prevent progression to eclampsia (option A).",

      "explanation": "Supine vena cava syndrome is the complication of the given representation. The image showscompression of the inferior vena cava by the gravid uterus which can sometimes lead to supinehypotension.During late pregnancy, the gravid uterus compresses the great vessels against the hard spine,when the patient is in the supine position. Of the two vessels, the vena cava is compressed, but theaorta, owing to its structure is relatively resistant.Normally, the vena cava compression results in opening up collateral circulation by means ofparavertebral and azygous veins but in some cases, when the collateral circulation fails to openup, the venous return of the heart may be seriously curtailed resulting in hypotension,tachycardia, and syncope and is called supine vena cava syndrome.The normal blood pressure is quickly restored by turning the patient to the lateral position.489",
