      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The ovary contains the maximum number of oogonia at the 5th month of intrauterine life. The number of oogonia is estimated to be 7 million. Oogenesis is the process wherein oogonia differentiate into mature oocytes. It begins before birth. At birth, there are approximately 2 million primordial follicles. At the initiation of puberty, the follicle count is less than 400,000, of which less than 500 are destined to ovulate. Every month, 15-20 follicles are released, out of which one matures to form the ovum.",

      "question": "A man with oligospermia has completed his course of hormonal treatment. After how many days will you test his sperm count?",
      "options": {
        "A": "50-60 days",
        "B": "60-70 days",
        "C": "80-90 days",
        "D": "70-80 days"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The sperm count is tested 80-90 days after hormonal treatment, as the average time taken for spermatogenesis is 74 days, and approximately 14 days to reach the ejaculatory ducts. The effect of hormonal therapy on the early phase of spermatogenesis is reflected in the ejaculated sperm concentration after three months. Spermatogenesis is the process of the formation of sperms from spermatogonia. Approximately 100 million sperms are produced daily. In patients diagnosed with oligospermia, hormonal treatment is carried out using FSH, hCG, or testosterone. Improvements in sperm count can take a few months, hence the course is usually for 3-6 months. Normal spermatogenesis occurs after this time period. Spermiogenesis refers to the series of changes that occur in the formation of spermatozoa from spermatids. These are: • Acrosome formation • Condensation of the nucleus • Formation of the neck, middle piece, and tail. Shedding of cytoplasm as residual bodies. Complete motility is obtained in the epididymis. Head Structure of the human spermatozoon: Acrosome, Surface membrane, Vacuole, Nucleus, Neck, Body, Mitochondria, Tail (flagellum) Microtubules.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The time taken for the capacitation of sperms is 6-8 hours (approximately 7 hours). Sperms have to undergo two changes in the female reproductive tract to be able to fertilize the ovum: 1) Capacitation. It is the functional maturation of the spermatozoa. It occurs in the fallopian tube and involves epithelial interactions between the sperm and the mucosal surface of the tube. The glycoprotein coat and seminal plasma proteins are removed. Only capacitated sperms can pass through the corona cells and undergo the acrosomal reaction. 2) Acrosomal reaction. It occurs after binding to zona pellucida, induced by zona proteins. Enzymes such as acrosin and trypsin-like protein are released to penetrate the zona pellucida. Ca2+ plays an important role. Zona pellucida: Protein layer. Acrosomal granule. Acrosome reaction. Ovum plasma membrane. Sperm head. Acrosomal reaction. Fused plasma membrane. Sperm plasma membrane.",

      "explanation": "Meiosis-I in the primary oocyte is resumed after an LH surge. Meiosis I oogenesis: Primordial stem cells (PSCs) - Oogonia (2n).

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Meiosis I or reductional division occurs in the transition from primary spermatocyte to secondary spermatocytes. Meiosis takes place in germ cells to generate male and female gametes. Meiosis involves two stages of cell division, namely, meiosis I and II. Meiosis I produces two haploid cells. Because the ploidy is reduced from diploid to haploid, meiosis I is referred to as a reductional division. Meiosis II is an equational division analogous to mitosis, resulting in the creation of four haploid daughter cells. Spermatogenesis: Primordial stem cells (PSCs) before puberty; Spermatogonial stem cells (550s) (Type A spermatogonia) after puberty. Mitosis, Meiosis I (Reduction division) (n), Meiosis II, Spermiogenesis (differentiation). Type B spermatogonia (2n) hosting primary spermatocytes (2n).

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The secondary oocyte is formed after meiosis I. Primordial germ cells divide by mitosis to form oogonia. The majority of the oogonia divide by mitosis; however, some enter meiosis I and are arrested in the diplotene stage of prophase and are now called primary oocytes. Primary oocytes have not yet completed meiosis, hence they are diploid. The primary oocyte, along with surrounding epithelial cells, forms the primordial follicle. Meiosis I is completed after the LH surge during puberty. Hence, at the completion of meiosis I, the secondary oocyte is produced. Oogenesis: Primordial stem cells (PSCs) - Oogonia (2n) - During intrauterine life - Meiosis I - Arrested in prophase (diplotene) - Meiosis I - Before puberty - After puberty - Primary oocyte (2n) - LH surge - First meiotic division completed - Secondary oocyte (n) - Meiosis II - Arrested in metaphase - Released from the ovary (ovulation) - Fertilisation - Second meiotic division completed - Mature egg cell/ovum (n) - By the 7th month of development - Primary polar body - Secondary polar bodies (n)",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Zona hatching occurs at around 5 days after fertilization. Fertilization is divided into the following phases: ● Penetration of the corona radiata, ● Penetration of the zona pellucida, ● Fusion of the oocyte and sperm cell membranes. After fertilization, the zygote differentiates to form the morula and then the blastocyst. The zona pellucida disappears at this stage, which is called zona hatching. The trophoblasts (outer cell mass) are now able to associate with the endometrium during implantation.",

      "explanation": "The fertilized ovum implants by 6-10 days in the uterine cavity. Implantation involves: • Apposition: Initial contact of the blastocyst to the uterine wall • Adhesion: Increased physical contact between the blastocyst and uterine epithelium • Invasion: Penetration and invasion of syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblasts into the endometrium.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "In the given image, the decidua basalis is marked as A. This part of the decidua forms the placenta. Subdivisions of decidua include the myometrium, decidua basalis, chorion, decidua capsularis, decidua parietalis, and uterine cavity. Implantation occurs 6 to 7 days after fertilization. After implantation, the endometrium is called the decidua. It is of the following types: Decidua basalis - present over the chorion frondosum. Decidua basalis and chorion frondosum form the placenta. Decidua capsularis - present over the abembryonic pole. Decidua parietalis - present on the opposite side of the uterus. The villi cover the entire surface of the chorion during the early weeks. As the fetus grows, the villi on the embryonic pole continue to grow, giving rise to the chorion frondosum. At the abembryonic pole, the villi degenerate. By the third month, this side of the chorion becomes smooth, and is called the chorion laeve. As the fetus grows, the chorion laeve comes into contact with the decidua parietalis on the opposite side of the uterus, and fusion occurs. Thus, the uterine lumen is obliterated. The amnion and chorion fuse to form the amniochorionic membrane. Rupture of the amniochorionic membrane during labor is called 'breaking of waters'. Note: Superfetation can theoretically occur till the time the uterine lumen is not obliterated. Development of placenta and amniotic cavity includes the decidua basalis, decidua parietalis, chorion frondosum, choric cavity, amniotic cavity, decidua capsularis, chorion laeve, yolk sac, uterine cavity, placenta, and fused decidua parietalis, chorion laeve, and amnion.",
