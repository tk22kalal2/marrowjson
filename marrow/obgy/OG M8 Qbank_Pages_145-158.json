      "question": "A pregnant woman has a fetus with Down's syndrome. The triple test done at 15-16 weeks will have",
      "options": {
        "A": "Low MSAFP, high hCG, low UE3",

        "D": "High MSAFP, low hCG, low UE3"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The triple test findings in pregnancies with fetal Down's syndrome are characterized by: low MSAFP (maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein) levels, approximately 0.7 MoM (multiples of median), low unconjugated estriol levels, approximately 0.8 MoM, and high hCG levels, approximately 2.0 MoM. The triple test is done between 15-18 weeks for the diagnosis of Down's syndrome. Various antenatal screening tests for aneuploidy are as follows: First-trimester screening with biochemical analytes (low PAPP-A and high hCG) and USG measurement of NT can improve the detection rate (87%) of Down's syndrome. For confirmation, a prenatal genetic study (CVS, amniocentesis, or cordocentesis) has to be performed. Second-trimester screening (quad screening) at 15–18 weeks: low MSAFP, low uE3, high inhibin A, and high hCG can detect trisomy 21 in 85% of cases with a false-positive rate of 0.9%. When it is combined with first-trimester screening, the detection rate is increased to 95%. The dual test (first trimester) includes beta HCG and PAPP-A. This can be combined with the triple test (second trimester), which includes beta HCG, or the quadruple test (second trimester), which includes beta HCG, unconjugated estriol, MSAFP, and inhibin A, along with nuchal translucency by USG.",

      "explanation": "Inhibin B is not a component assayed under the quad-screening test. Dimeric inhibin-A is evaluated in this screening test. Quadruple testing is done in the second trimester between 15-21 weeks of gestation. It comprises: Maternal serum AFP, Human chorionic gonadotropin, Unconjugated estriol (E3), and Dimeric inhibin A. The following table summarizes the findings of the quad-screening test in various conditions. Various antenatal screening tests for aneuploidy are as follows: Parameter - Trisomy 21, Trisomy 18, Neural tube defect or abdominal wall defect: MSAFP - Low, Low, High, β hCG - High, Low, Normal, Unconjugated estriol - Low, Low, Normal, Inhibin A - High, Normal/Normal, Low. Dual test (1st trimester) includes 1. Beta HCG, 2. PAPPA (Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A). This can be combined with nuchal translucency by USG. Triple test (2nd trimester) includes 1. Beta HCG, 2. Unconjugated estriol, 3. MSAFP. Quadruple test (2nd trimester) includes 1. Beta HCG, 2. Unconjugated estriol, 3. MSAFP, 4. Serum inhibin.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The quadruple screening test is ideally done in the second trimester, during 15-20 weeks of gestation. The most accurate values are seen during 16-18 weeks of gestation. It is the measurement of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP), unconjugated estriol, hCG, and inhibin-A. In Down's syndrome (trisomy 21) or Edward's syndrome (trisomy 18), quadruple-marker screenings do not provide any added benefit over first-trimester screenings. It is generally used as a stand-alone test if screening is done for the first time in the second trimester or if first-trimester screening is not available.

Elevated levels of MSAFP are seen in: • Underestimated gestational age • Severe oligohydramnios • Multifetal pregnancy • Neural tube defects • Abdominal wall defects - Omphalocele, Gastroschisis • Hepatoma • Endodermal sinus tumor. Reduced levels of MSAFP are seen in: • Overestimated gestational age • Overweight mother • Gestational trophoblastic diseases • Spontaneous abortion, Trisomy 18 and 21.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The next best step is targeted sonography. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) levels are only used as a screening test and must be followed by a diagnostic test. Amniocentesis is a diagnostic test for amniotic fluid AFP measurement. It was once considered the standard for the diagnosis of open neural tube disorders but has been replaced in most centers by targeted sonography. Defects in fetal integuments, such as ventral wall and neural tube defects, permit fetal AFP to leak into the amniotic fluid. This results in increased MSAFP levels. This is detected on screening performed from 15 to 20 weeks of gestation. Conditions with elevated MSAFP include wrong gestational age, neural tube defects, multiple pregnancies, and renal anomalies. Conditions with decreased MSAFP include trisomies (Down's syndrome) and gestational trophoblastic disease.",
