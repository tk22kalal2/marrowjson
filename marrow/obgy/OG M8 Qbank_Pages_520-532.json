      "explanation": "The Lewis antigens do not cause alloimmunization or hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn.Alloimmunization/isoimmunisation is defined as an immune response to foreign antigens afterexposure to genetically different cells or tissues.The Kell blood group system is complex and contains many antigens that are highlyimmunogenic. These antigens are the third most potent, after those of the ABO and Rh bloodgroups, at triggering an immune reaction. Anti-Kell causes severe fetal anemia by suppressingfetal RBC synthesis.MNS and Kidd blood types cause alloimmunization. Hemolytic disease of newborn is mild withKidd whereas MNS causes potentially severe anemia.525",

It isalso known as the acid elution test.The principle behind it is that fetal erythrocytes contain hemoglobin F, which is more resistant toacid elution than hemoglobin A.After exposure to acid, only fetal hemoglobin remains, such that after staining, the fetalerythrocytes appear red and adult cells appear as \"ghosts.\" Fetal cells are counted and expressedas a percentage of adult cells.Flow cytometry is the best test for the quantification of fetomaternal hemorrhage. It is moresensitive and accurate as compared to the Kleihauer-Betke test.Flow cytometry can analyze a larger number of cells and is not influenced by maternal levels offetal hemoglobin and fetal levels of maternal hemoglobin. It utilizes monoclonal antibodies toHbF or to the D antigen followed by quantification by fluorescence.Anti-HbF PE1E4Fetal Erthyrocytes HbF++1E31E21E111E1LeucocytesMaternal erythrocytes HbF+Maternal Erthyrocytes Hbf +1E2Logarithmic FL1OMARROW1 E31E4",

      "explanation": "The clinical scenario is suggestive of maternal mirror syndrome/Ballantyne syndrome. It may beconsidered a form of severe pre-eclampsia.Maternal mirror syndrome is the association between fetal hydrops and the development ofmaternal edema. The syndrome is named as such because the mother mirrors the fetus. It ischaracterized by triple edema i.e., the fetus, mother, and placenta become edematous.The pathogenesis of mirror syndrome, although not well established, mimics trophoblasticdamage and maternal vascular endothelial dysfunction, as is also seen in pre-eclampsia. Hence,these two conditions may have a similar clinical presentation, with common features such as:• Edema• Hypertension• Proteinuria• Liver enzyme elevation• Headache and visual disturbances.However, in contrast to preeclampsia, the following features are noted in maternal mirrorsyndrome:• Low maternal hematocrit i.e., hemodilution rather than hemoconcentration•Polyhydramnios rather than oligohydramnios• The fetus always shows signs of hydrops.530The etiology of fetal hydrops is not related to the development of mirror syndrome. Hydrops couldbe due to rhesus isoimmunization, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, congenital infections, fetalcystic hygroma, Ebstein anomaly, sacrococcygeal teratoma, vein of Galen aneurysms, etc.In most cases with mirror syndrome, prompt delivery is indicated, because women with severefeatures of preeclampsia can deteriorate rapidly. In few cases, identification and treatment of thecause of fetal hydrops resulted in the resolution of symptoms for both the mother and baby for theremainder of the pregnancy.",
