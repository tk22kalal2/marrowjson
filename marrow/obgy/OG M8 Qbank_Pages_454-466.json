      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The second most common pathological cause of anemia during pregnancy is anemia associatedwith chronic disease. The most common pathological cause of anemia during pregnancy is irondeficiency anemia.Women with chronic disorders may develop anemia for the first time during pregnancy. Causesinclude:• Chronic renal insufficiency - the most common cause. Recombinant erythropoietin is used fortreating anemia due to chronic renal failure.• Inflammatory bowel disease• Connective tissue disorders• Granulomatous infections•Malignant neoplasms• Rheumatoid arthritis•⚫ Chronic suppurative conditions.Note: The most common cause of anemia in pregnancy is physiological. It is normally seen duringpregnancy. This occurs due to the expansion of plasma volume by 30-40%. This increase is muchmore than the increase in red cell mass (20-30%) during pregnancy. This leadsto hemodilution and an apparent decrease in hemoglobin levels.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Maternal requirement of iron during a singleton gestation averages close to 1000 mg.The average iron stores in a non-pregnant female is around 300 mg. This falls short of therequirement of iron during pregnancy which is 1000 mg. Hence iron supplementation isnecessary to prevent iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy. This also forms the basis forprophylactic iron supplementation during pregnancy.Note: The Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (FOGSI) states that the iron requirement inpregnancy is 840 mg, as about 160 mg of iron is saved due to amenorrhea during pregnancy.Iron requirement during pregnancyFetus and placenta300mg460Iron requirement during pregnancyExpansion of maternal hemoglobin mass500mgLosses through normal excretion routes200mgTotal1000mg",

        "D": "Epilepsy - 8 mg"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The amount of folic acid to be given to pregnant women suffering from sickle cell anemia is 5 mg.This is to reduce the risk of neural tube defects and to compensate for the increased demand forfolate during pregnancy.Normally in all sickle cell patients (irrespective of age or sex), 1mg of folic acid is given to preventfolate deficiency.Note: William's Obstetrics 26th Edition mentions folic acid 4 mg daily for pregnant women withsickle cell disease. However various other sources and RCOG guidelines mention it as 5 mg daily.Hence this is the best answer.",

      "explanation": "In the given scenario, history suggestive of restless leg syndrome and Hb of 10.1g/dL points to adiagnosis of iron deficiency anemia. Serum ferritin is the most sensitive indicator of irondeficiency anemia in pregnant women.This is because its concentrations are not affected by the recent intake of iron-rich foods. Serumferritin concentration &lt;15 µg/L indicates iron deficiency anemia.However, treatment needs to be initiated when the concentration falls &lt;30 µg/L, as thisindicates early iron depletion.Restless leg syndrome also called Willis-Ekbom Disease, causes unpleasant or uncomfortablesensations in the legs along with an irresistible urge to move them.
