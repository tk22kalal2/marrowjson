      "explanation": "The maternal plasma prolactin level is highest at term and reduces after delivery. Despite this high level, milk secretion does not occur during pregnancy due to the action of estrogen and progesterone. Prolactin secretion returns to the nonpregnant level a few weeks after delivery. The levels of estrogen and progesterone fall, and hence, prolactin can promote milk secretion even at a lesser concentration.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Total T3 levels are altered throughout pregnancy. Total T3 and total T4 increase due to stimulation of thyroid tissue by hCG during the early period of gestation. However, there is no change in free T3 and T4 due to an increase in thyroid-binding globulin (TBG). This leads to a transient fall in TSH during the early weeks of gestation. The level of TSH becomes normal during the second and third trimester. Hormone secretion during pregnancy: • Increased: GH, insulin, prolactin, aldosterone, testosterone, total T3, T4 • Decreased: LH, FSH, DHEAS (dihydroepiandrosterone) • Unchanged: TSH, ADH (vasopressin), free T3, T4",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Relaxin is not synthesised by the fetal adrenal gland in a pregnant woman. It is synthesised by the corpus luteum, decidua, and placenta. Relaxin is a placental protein hormone. Plasma levels peak between 8 and 12 weeks of gestation and decline thereafter to lower levels that persist until term. Functions of relaxin are: • Relaxation of myometrium and quiescence of early pregnancy • Enhancement of the glomerular filtration rate • Endometrial vascular remodelling by inducing secretion of VEGF",

      "options": {
        "A": "Insulin resistance",
        "B": "Increase in BMR",
        "C": "Hypothyroidism",
        "D": "Increase in blood volume"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Among the given features, hypothyroidism is not a major physiological change in pregnancy. The beta-subunits of hCG and TSH are identical. An increase in hCG during pregnancy stimulates the thyroid and leads to a decrease in TSH levels. The thyroid undergoes enlargement and boosts the production of hormones. This is accompanied by increased production of thyroid-binding globulin (TBG). All these changes increase total T4 and T3 in the first trimester. But the physiologically important free T4 and T3 levels remain unchanged. Hence, physiologically pregnant women remain euthyroid. Option A: Normal pregnancy is characterized by insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Human placental lactogen (hPL) secreted during pregnancy helps in adaptation to fetal energy requirements. Insulin resistance causes prolonged hyperglycemia and glucose flow to the fetus. It also favors protein synthesis. To counterbalance the increased insulin resistance and prevent maternal hyperglycemia, maternal insulin levels are increased. Option B: By the 3rd trimester, there is an increase in the maternal basal metabolic rate by 10 to 20% in comparison to a nonpregnant woman. Option D: During normal pregnancy, mean arterial pressure and vascular resistance decrease, while blood volume and cardiac output rate increase. This helps in meeting metabolic demands of the enlarged uterus, providing nutrients to the rapidly growing placenta and fetus, and safeguarding the mother against the effects of parturition-associated blood loss.",

        "C": "hCG",
        "D": "Estrogen"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "hCG is not implicated in insulin resistance during pregnancy. As the fetus is dependent on maternal glucose for sustenance, the blood glucose levels are maintained at a high level in the mother. In response to this, the insulin level in the mother increases, which reduces the maternal blood glucose. To counteract this, the placenta secretes certain hormones which increase insulin resistance in the mother. This resistance is maximal between 24 to 28 weeks. Hormones increasing insulin resistance include: • Human placental lactogen - Increases lipolysis and liberation of free fatty acids • Progesterone and estrogen. Placental growth hormone - Major determinant of maternal insulin resistance after mid-pregnancy • Cortisol • Prolactin",

It usually occurs in the later stages of pregnancy, particularly inthe third trimester. It occurs due to fetal deficiency of long-chain acyl-coenzyme Adehydrogenase (LCHAD) or poor placental mitochondrial function.The patients present with persistent nausea and vomiting, progressive jaundice, and epigastricpain. Features like acute hemolysis, hypoglycemia, hypertension, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia,and edema can also be present. Symptoms may progress to fulminant hepatic failure withencephalopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death.Liver function tests such as AST, ALT, and serum bilirubin levels are raised. Hypofibrinogenemia,hypocholesterolemia, and prolonged clotting time can be seen. An elevated d-dimer isseen. Microscopy reveals a characteristic microvesicular fatty infiltration.The condition worsens till delivery after which the hepatic dysfunction resolves. A trial of labor byinduction or delivery by Cesarean is done.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Spotting on the expected date of menstruation in the early months of pregnancy is known asplacental sign.Cyclic bleeding may occur up to 12 weeks of pregnancy until the decidual space is obliterated bythe fusion of decidua parietalis with decidua capsularis. The bleeding is usually scanty and lastsfor a shorter duration than in a regular menstrual cycle.Option A: Slowing of the fetal heart rate (FHR) on pressing the head down into the pelvis issuggestive of placenta previa (especially of posterior type) and is called Stallworthy's sign. Thefetal heart rate recovers as soon as the pressure is released.Options C and D: Permanent lengthening of the cord and slight gush of bleeding in 3rd stage oflabor are suggestive of separation of the placenta.126",

      "question": "Detailed ExplanationsThere is an increase in the metabolism of glycogen in the vaginal epithelium during normalpregnancy.The changes in the vagina during pregnancy include:• Increased vascularity and hyperemia resulting in a violet/purplish color characteristic ofChadwick's sign• Vaginal epithelium undergoes marked proliferation (option D) with the extension of thesquamocolumnar junction downwards• Vaginal pH decreases and becomes more acidic (option C) and varies from 3.5-6.0.• Increase in the number of Lactobacillus acidophilus (option",
      "options": {
        "A": ". It metabolizes the glycogenstores and causes an increased production of lactic acid. Therefore, the pH becomes acidic.• Increased volume of cervical secretion during pregnancy results in the production of thick whitevaginal discharge.Solution to Question 2:During pregnancy, vaginal cytology shows a predominance of intermediate cells.Solution to Question 3:The patient in the given question is obese. The recommended gestational weight gain in such apatient is 5-9 kg.Ideally, weight gain should depend on the pre-pregnancy BMI (body mass index) level. Thegestational weight gain recommended for each BMI category by the Institute of Medicine (IOM)are as follows:CategoryBMI (in kg/m2)Recommended weightgainUnderwe <18.512.5-18 kgightNormal 18.5-24.911.5-14 kgOverweig 25-29.97-11.5 kghtObese>305-9.1 kg117Solution to Question 4:The diaphragm is elevated by 4 cm in pregnancy.The anatomical changes in the respiratory system during pregnancy are:• Elevation of diaphragm by 4 cm• Transverse diameter of chest increases by 2 cm• Chest circumference increases by 5-7 cm•Subcostal angle increases from 68 degrees to 103 degreesSolution to Question 5:Functional residual capacity decreases in pregnancy.The changes in the respiratory system during pregnancy are:(Mnemonic: TIMM increases in pregnancy)IncreaseTidal volumeInspiratory capacityMinute O2uptakeMinuteventilationDecreaseFunctional residual capacityExpiratory reserve volumeResidual volumeTotal lung capacityUnaffectedRespiratory rateVital capacityInspiratory reserve volumeVolume (liters)Lung volumes and CapacitiesMaximum inspirationTidalVolume(TV)Inspiratoryreserve volume(IRV)wwwFunctional residualcapacity (FRC)VitalCapacity(VC)Inspiratorycapacity (IC)www.MExpiratory reservevolume (ERV)Residual volume(RV)Time(seconds)Resting inspirationTotal lungcapacity (TLC)Resting expirationMaximum expirationOMARROWSolution to Question 6:The maternal plasma prolactin level is highest at term and reduces after delivery. Despite thishigh level, milk secretion does not occur during pregnancy due to the action of estrogen and118progesterone.Prolactin secretion returns to the nonpregnant level a few weeks after delivery. The levels ofestrogen and progesterone fall and hence, prolactin can promote milk secretion even at a lesserconcentration.Solution to Question 7:In the first two months of pregnancy, estrogen and progesterone are produced by the corpusluteum.It functions maximally during the second month of pregnancy and thereafter contributesrelatively little. Estrogen is synthesized in the placenta from the 7th week and progesterone fromthe 8th week.Solution to Question 8:Total T3 levels are altered throughout pregnancy.Total T3 and total T4 increase due to stimulation of thyroid tissue by hCG during the early periodof gestation. However, there is no change in free T3 and T4 due to an increase in thyroid-bindingglobulin (TBG).This leads to a transient fall in TSH during the early weeks of gestation. The level of TSH becomesnormal during the second and third trimester.Hormone secretion during pregnancy:• Increased• GH• Insulin• Prolactin• Aldosterone• Testosterone• Total T3, T4• Decreased• LH• FSH• DHEAS (dihydroepiandosterone)• UnchangedTSH• ADH (vasopressin)119• Free T3, T4Solution to Question 9:Relaxin is not synthesised by the fetal adrenal gland in a pregnant woman. It is synthesisedby corpus luteum, decidua and placenta.Relaxin is a placental protein hormone. Plasma levels peak between 8 and 12 weeks of gestationand decline thereafter to lower levels that persist until term.Functions of relaxin are:• Relaxation of myometrium and quiescence of early pregnancy• Enhancement of the glomerular filtration rate• Endometrial vascular remodelling by inducing secretion of VEGFSolution to Question 10:Among the given features hypothyroidism is not a major physiological change in pregnancy.The -subunits of hCG and TSH are identical. An increase in hCG during pregnancy stimulatesthyroid and leads to a decrease in TSH levels. The thyroid undergoes enlargement and boosts theproduction of hormones. This is accompanied by increased production of thyroid-bindingglobulin (TBG). All these changes increase total T4 and T3 in the first trimester. But thephysiologically important free T4 and T3 levels remain unchanged. Hence, physiologicallypregnant women remain euthyroid.Option A: Normal pregnancy is characterized by insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Humanplacental lactogen(hPL) secreted during pregnancy, helps in adaptation to fetal energyrequirements. Insulin resistance causes prolonged hyperglycemia and glucose flow to the fetus. Italso favours protein synthesis. To counterbalance the increased insulin resistance and preventmaternal hyperglycemia, maternal insulin levels are increased.Option B: By the 3rd trimester, there is an increase in the maternal basal metabolic rate by 10 to20% in comparison to a nonpregnant woman.Option D: During normal pregnancy, mean arterial pressure and vascular resistance decrease,while blood volume and cardiac output rate increase. This helps in meeting metabolic demands ofthe enlarged uterus, provide nutrients to rapidly growing placenta and fetus, safeguard motheragainst the effects of parturition-associated blood loss.Solution to Question 11:hCG is not implicated in insulin resistance during pregnancy.120As the fetus is dependant on maternal glucose for sustenance, the blood glucose levels aremaintained at a high level in the mother. In response to this, the insulin level in the motherincreases, which reduces the maternal blood glucose. To counteract this, the placenta secretescertain hormones which increase insulin resistance in the mother. This resistance is maximalbetween 24 to 28 weeks.Hormones increasing insulin resistance include:• Human placental lactogen - Increases lipolysis and liberation of free fatty acids• Progesterone and estrogen.Placental growth hormone - Major determinant of maternal insulin resistance aftermid-pregnancy• Cortisol.• ProlactinSolution to Question 12:Serum creatinine levels decrease during normal pregnancy from a mean of 0.7 mg/dL to 0.5mg/dL.Physiological changes in the renal system during pregnancy include:• Increase in:• Renal blood flow(+80%)•GFR(+50%)• Creatinine clearance• Glucosuria•• Decrease in:• Plasma osmolality• Creatinine•• Uric acid• Na/K/ClAnatomical changes in the renal system during pregnancy include:•⚫ Both kidneys enlarge by 1 cm• Hydroureter and hydronephrosis - More common on the right side due to dextrorotation of theuterus• Congestion of the bladder causing decreased bladder capacity• Increased bladder pressure and intraurethral pressure121Solution to Question 13:The total oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood increases during pregnancy.During pregnancy, there is an increase in total haemoglobin (H",
        "B": "resulting in increased totaloxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. However, there is a relative decrease in Hb.concentration (hematocrit) due to a greater increase in plasma volume. This decreasesoxygen-carrying capacity per unit volume of blood.Maternal iron stores are not sufficient to meet the increased demand during pregnancy and hencethe serum iron and ferritin concentration falls.The plasma volume expansion also lowers serum potassium.Solution to Question 14:Decrease in peripheral vascular resistance is a physiological change seen in pregnancy.Cardiovascular parameters that increase in pregnancy are:• Cardiac output• Stroke volume•• Heart rateCardiovascular parameters that decrease in pregnancy are:••Peripheral vascular resistance (due to smooth muscle relaxation by progesterone)• Both diastolic BP and systolic BP (decrease in DBP &gt; SBP)•Mean arterial BP• Artery venous O2 gradientSolution to Question 15:The clinical features are suggestive of physiological edema during pregnancy for which the mostappropriate treatment is bed rest.It occurs due to increased venous pressure of the inferior extremities by the gravid uterus pressingon the common iliac veins.Features of physiological edema in pregnancy are:•Slight degree of ankle edema• Usually confined to one leg, more commonly the right leg•• Not associated with any other features of preeclampsia (like BP&gt;140/90mm Hg, proteinuria)• Disappears with rest• Other cardiac, renal and hematological pathologies are absent122Solution to Question 16:The blood flow to the skin and mucous membranes increases during pregnancy to a maximum of500 mL/min by the 36th week. Symptoms experienced during pregnancy such as increased heatsensation, sweating or having a stuffy nose can be explained by the increased blood flow.Regional distribution of blood flow during pregnancy:• Uterine blood flow - increased from 50 mL/min in the non-pregnant state to about 750 mL nearterm.• Pulmonary blood flow - increased by 2,500 mL/min.•Renal blood flow - increases by 400 mL/min at 16th week and remains at this level till term.Solution to Question 17:S3 is normally heard during pregnancy.The third heart sound (S3) occurs due to rapid diastolic filling in hypervolemic states such aspregnancy, anemia or thyrotoxicosis. Hypervolemia is a normal physiological change duringpregnancy.The auscultation of a fixed split S2, fourth heart sound (S4) or a pericardial knock are suggestiveof cardiac pathology.Solution to Question 18:All clotting factors increase in pregnancy except factors XI and XIII.Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state with physiological changes such as:••All clotting factors are increased (except factors XI and XIII)• Fibrinogen levels are also increased•The viscosity of blood decreases due to hemodilution•Clotting time and bleeding time is unaffectedThe most common cause of decreased platelet count in pregnancy is benign gestationalthrombocytopenia. This is due to hemodilution and increased platelet consumption and thewomen are generally asymptomatic.Solution to Question 19:123The clinical features are suggestive of supine hypotension syndrome due to inferior vena cavalcompression.During late pregnancy, the gravid uterus produces a compression effect on the inferior vena cava(IV",
        "C": "when the patient is in the supine position. To compensate, there will be an opening up ofthe collaterals of paravertebral and azygous veins.When collaterals fail to open, venous return of the heart is reduced leading to hypotension,tachycardia, and syncope. The normal blood pressure is quickly restored by turning the patientto lateral position.Solution to Question 20:The sensitivity of uterine musculature is enhanced by estrogen and inhibited by progesterone.Estrogen stimulates the synthesis of myometrial contractile proteins through cAMP. Thisincreases the excitability of uterine muscles and the frequency of action potentials.Progesterone decreases the frequency and intensity of uterine contractions. This helps to preventthe expulsion of the implanted ovum. However, it increases the amplitude of contraction.Solution to Question 21:Extension at the knee joint and dorsiflexion at the ankle joint helps in stretching the calf muscleswhich relieves the pain.Leg cramps are minor ailments during pregnancy mostly due to a deficiency of diffusible serumcalcium or elevation of serum phosphorus. Management includes massaging the leg, stretchingexercises, application of local heat, and supplementation of vitamin B1 and calcium.Solution to Question 22:Theca lutein cysts are not seen in hyperprolactinemia.Theca-lutein cysts are benign ovarian lesions resulting from exaggerated physiological folliclestimulation. They are usually associated with markedly elevated serum levels of hCG.Theca lutein cysts are found in association with:•• Large placenta• Diabetes•Anti-D alloimmunization• Multifetal gestations• Fetal hydrops• Gestational trophoblastic disease - Molar pregnancy124• Reduced hCG clearance - Chronic renal failureThey may also be found in normal pregnancy due to an exaggerated response of the ovaries tonormal circulating levels of hCG.Solution to Question 23:Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) occurs most commonly in the third trimester or earlypostpartum period.Risk factors include Pre-eclampsia/HELLP syndrome, male fetus, previous history of AFLP, andmultiple gestations.AFLP (acute yellow atrophy or acute fatty metamorphosis) is the most common cause of acuteliver failure in pregnancy. It usually occurs in the later stages of pregnancy, particularly inthe third trimester. It occurs due to fetal deficiency of long-chain acyl-coenzyme Adehydrogenase (LCHA",
        "D": "or poor placental mitochondrial function.The patients present with persistent nausea and vomiting, progressive jaundice, and epigastricpain. Features like acute hemolysis, hypoglycemia, hypertension, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia,and edema can also be present. Symptoms may progress to fulminant hepatic failure withencephalopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death.Liver function tests such as AST, ALT, and serum bilirubin levels are raised. Hypofibrinogenemia,hypocholesterolemia, and prolonged clotting time can be seen. An elevated d-dimer isseen. Microscopy reveals a characteristic microvesicular fatty infiltration.The condition worsens till delivery after which the hepatic dysfunction resolves.
