There is maternal hyperparathyroidism due tohypomagnesemia which leads to increased maternal calcium.This maternal calcium passes to the infant through the placenta and suppresses fetal PTHsynthesis and impairs PTH response to postpartum hypocalcemia.

      "explanation": "The image showing a poorly developed lower limb suggests the diagnosis of caudal regressionsequence/sacral agenesis seen in pregestational diabetes. It is the most specific anomaly seen indiabetes.The caudal regression sequence is a rare malformation, frequently associated with maternalpre-gestational diabetes. It consists of a spectrum of structural defects of the caudal region,including incomplete development of the sacrum and the lumbar vertebrae.Elevated maternal HbA1c levels correlate with fetal malformations. It occurs approximately 200times more frequently in infants of diabetic mothers than in other infants.Overt diabetes (pregestational diabetes) is associated with higher malformation rates than thegeneral population. Neural tube defects (encephalocele, meningomyelocele, anencephaly),transposition of great vessels, ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, hypoplastic left heart,aortic stenosis and coarctation of the aorta are commonly seen.Small left colon syndrome is a rare anomaly that develops in the second and third trimesters.Option B: Malformations are not associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).Malformations occur due to the disruption of organogenesis, usually occurring in the first502trimester. The abnormal glycemic status in GDM manifests only in the second trimester.Option C: Valproate leads to neural tube defects and not sacral agenesis.Option D: ACE inhibitors can cause oligohydramnios.",
