      "explanation": "In the clinal scenario of a 55-year-old woman with third-degree uterine prolapse, the idealmanagement is vaginal hysterectomy with pelvic floor repair.Uterine prolapse is the descent of the uterus from its normal position which usually occurs due tolaxity of ligaments that offer support, seen often due to childbirth, aging, or trauma. The uterinedescent is clinically categorized into:•• First degree: the external os remains above the vaginal introitus605• Second degree: The external os protrudes below the vaginal introitus but the uterine bodyremains inside the vagina• Third degree (Syn: Complete prolapse): The uterine, cervix, body, and fundus descend to lieoutside the introitus•Procidentia involves prolapse of the uterus with the entire vagina everted.The patient usually presents with a sense of heaviness in the pelvic region with lower backdiscomfort. Based on the structures involved the patient can additionally have urinary symptoms(like incontinence and urgency), bowel disturbances (constipation and tenesmus), or sexualdiscomfort during intercourse.Symptomatic uterine prolapse is managed surgically with different procedures based on theprofile of the patient.

If the pessarydescends to the introitus with these maneuvers, then a larger size pessary should be tried.The pessary is well-fitted if you are able to slide the ring of the pessary up and down along thevaginal sidewall. It is well-fitted if you are able to insert one finger between the vaginal sidewalland the edge of the pessary.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Pubococcygeus is the deepest part of the levator ani muscle. Injury to it can cause enterocele,cystocele, and urethral descent.Levator ani muscles are the most important muscles in the pelvic floor and maintain a constantstate of contraction. They provide a stable floor and support the weight of the abdominopelviccontents against intra-abdominal forces. Weakening of levator ani and pelvic fascia fromstretching or tearing during childbirth, may decrease support for the vagina, bladder, uterus, orrectum or alter the position of the neck of the bladder and urethra.The levator ani muscle is a complex unit, which consists of 3 muscle components namely•⚫ Pubococcygeus (anterior fibers)⚫ Pubovaginalis - elevates the urethra and hence contributes to urinary continence••⚫ Puboperinealis - draws the perineal body towards the pubic symphysis•⚫ Puboanalis elevates the anus and keeps the urogenital hiatus narrowed•Puborectalis (intermediate fibers)• Iliococcygeus (posterior fibers)Origin: The levator ani muscle has a linear origin from the pelvic surface of the body of the pubis,a tendinous arch of obturator fascia, and the pelvic surface of the ischial spine.Insertion:• The anterior fibres form a sling around the prostate (levator prostatae) or vagina (sphinctervaginae) and are inserted into the perineal body (a mass of fibrous tissue) in front of the analcanal.611• The intermediate fibres (puborectalis) form a sling around the anorectal junction to be insertedinto the anococcygeal raphe (a fibrous raphe which extends from the anorectal junction to the tipof the coccyx).•⚫ The posterior fibres (iliococcygeus) are inserted into the anococcygeal raphe and the coccyx.Nerve supply:• perineal branch of 4th sacral nerve (S4) from its pelvic surface.•⚫ perineal branch of the pudendal nerve (S2, S3) from its perineal surface.Actions:•The levator ani muscles of two sides together support the pelvic viscera and resist theintra-abdominal pressure during straining and expulsive efforts of the anterior abdominal wallmuscles.•They also subserve a sphincteric action on the anorectal junction to maintain the continence offaeces in both sexes and vagina in females.UrethralcanalVaginal canal(females only)Rectal canalSacrumPubic crestIliacusIliac crestsPelvic diaphragm (superior view)The given image below shows the pelvic floor:-PubococcygeusIliococcygeusLevator ani612Endopelvicfascia lining superioraspect of deepperineal space/pouch.UrethraVaginaRectumPubococcygeusIliococcygeus.IschiococcygeusPiriformisAnococcygeal ligamentPelvic floor0OMARROWPubic symphysisPubisTendinous archof levator aniFascia overobturatorinternusIschiumIliac wingThird and fourthsacral foraminaSacrum",
