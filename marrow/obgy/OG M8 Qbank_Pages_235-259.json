      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Occipitoposterior position (OP) is the most common cause of a mobile head at term.It is the most common fetal malposition. It is an abnormal position seen in the vertexpresentation, not an abnormal presentation.•Occipitoposterior position is commonly seen in android pelvis/deflexed head.• The engaging diameter of this position is sub-occipitofrontal/occipitofrontal.• The most common type in occipitoposterior position is right OP.• A persistent occipitoposterior position results from a failure of internal rotation prior to birth.258Cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD) is a disproportion in the size of the fetus relative to thematernal pelvis. This can result in the failure of progress of labour in the second stage. Thisusually occurs due to fetal malposition e.g., extended or asynclitic fetal head, occipitoposterior ortransverse position. It is also seen in malpresentations like mentum posterior, brow.The diagnosis of CPD is subjective. However, true CPD may occur if the fetus has a large anomalye.g., teratoma or conjoined twin, or in cases of a large fetus. It can also occur when the maternalpelvis is small or deformed like after pelvic trauma.",

It occurswhen either the anterior or the posterior fetal shoulder gets impacted on the maternal symphysisor on the sacral promontory respectively.Prelabour risk factors:• Diabetes Mellitus• Obesity• Postdatism and prior history• Excessive weight gain during pregnancyIntrapartum risk factors:243• Prolonged 1st and 2nd stage of labour• Instrumental delivery•• Augmentation of labour with oxytocinSolution to Question 2:A patient with gestational diabetes and the presence of turtle sign is suggestive of shoulderdystocia. Mc Robert's manoeuvre, Wood's corkscrew manoeuvre, Gaskin'smanoeuvre, and Rubin's manoeuvre are all used in its management.Shoulder dystocia occurs when either the anterior or the posterior fetal shoulder gets impacted onthe maternal pelvis. Turtle sign may be seen which refers to the recoil of the fetal head against theperineum.Management of labour in case of shoulder dystocia:• 1st line of management - Mc Roberts manoeuvre (flexion and abduction of thigh)• 2nd line of management - Rubin's (rotation of the easily accessible shoulder by 30-45°), Woodscorkscrew manoeuvre (rotate the posterior shoulder to 1800 in a cork screw fashion) ; OR Gaskin(all four's position)•• Last line of management - Zavanelli manoeuvre (head is rotated to its pre-restitution positionand caesarian section is performed); OR procedures such as cleidotomy (fracture of the clavicle ofthe baby); symphysiotomy (divide pubic symphysis of mother)In a case of bilateral shoulder dystocia, directly proceed to perform cesarean section after doingZavanelli manoeuvre.Woods corkscrew manoeuvreMARROWB›MARROW244Zavanelli manoeuvreMARROWBOMARROWCleidotomyOMARROWSolution to Question 3:The given clinical scenario is suggestive of shoulder dystocia. Mc Roberts manoeuvre is the firstmanoeuvre to be performed in shoulder dystocia. It involves flexion and abduction ofthe maternal hips, positioning the maternal thighs on her abdomen.Solution to Question 4:The given clinical scenario is suggestive of shoulder dystocia and the manoeuvre shown above isthe McRoberts manoeuvre. This is the most effective intervention and should be the firstmanoeuvre to be performed in shoulder dystocia.245McRoberts manoeuvre:• Flexion and abduction of the maternal hips (positioning the maternal thighs on her abdomen).•The pelvic rotation which occurs due to the straightening of the sacrum tends to free theimpacted anterior shoulder of the baby.•Suprapubic pressure may be used simultaneously.• The lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh is the most common nerve to get injured during thismanoeuvre.If the first line of management fails, proceed with internal rotational manoeuvres such as Rubin'sand Wood corkscrew in McRoberts position.Rubin's manoeuvre:.•• Internal rotational manoeuver used to deliver the baby in case of shoulder dystocia.It involves dislodging the easily accessible shoulder towards the anterior aspect of the chest fromunder the pubic symphysis by 30-45° while staying in the McRoberts' position.•• Pressure is applied on the scapular aspect (posteriorly) of the shoulder.Rubin's manoeuvreMARRO30 to 45 degreerotationWood corkscrew manoeuvre:••• Internal rotational manoeuver used to deliver the baby in case of shoulder dystocia.It involves dislodging the posterior shoulder by 180° in a corkscrew fashion to lie beneath thepubic symphysis while staying in McRobert's position.• Pressure is applied on the clavicular aspect (anteriorly) of the shoulder.246Woods corkscrew manoeuvreMAROWRB©MARROWSolution to Question 5:Applying a gentle suprapubic pressure is the first step in the management of shoulder dystociaalong with McRoberts manoeuvre. Fundal pressure is not a method of delivery in such cases.Hernandez and Wendel suggested the use of a shoulder dystocia drill to better organizeemergency management:• Call for help and mobilize labour assistants, anaesthesia and pediatric doctors.• An attempt at traction is tried followed by episiotomy to afford room posteriorly.•Apply pressure suprapubically, not fundally, with the palm or fist, directing the pressure on theanterior shoulder.•This should be both downward (below the pubic bone) and laterally (toward the baby's face orsternum) in conjunction with the McRoberts manoeuvre.These manoeuvres will resolve most cases of shoulder dystocia. If the above-listed steps fail, thefollowing steps may be attempted, and any of the manoeuvres may be repeated:•• Rubin's manoeuvre•• Woods corkscrew manoeuvre• Gaskin (all four's position)•Zavanelli manoeuvre•Cleidotomy (fracture of the clavicle of baby)• Symphysiotomy (divide pubic symphysis of mother).Solution to Question 6:247The most common fetal malpresentation is the breech presentation.The most common breech presentation in primigravida is frank breech and in multigravida, itis flexed/complete breech. It is most commonly seen with prematurity.In breech presentation:• The most common position is left sacroanterior•The engaging diameter is bitrochanteric.• Cord prolapse is common in footling presentation and rare in frank breech.However, among all malpresentations, cord prolapse is most common in transverse lie.Solution to Question 7:Vagos method is used in cord prolapse.Vagos method is also known as the bladder filling method. Here, the bladder is distended withsaline to push the presenting part higher up, thereby preventing compression in case of cordprolapse. The bladder is filled with 400-750 mL of normal saline with a Foley's catheter. Then,the balloon is inflated and the catheter is clamped.Solution to Question 8:The given clinical scenario is suggestive of frank breech.Breech presentation can be divided into the following:••Incomplete: Breech with extended legs, footling, knee presentationComplete: Breech with flexed legsBreech typeFrank breech (with extended 1egs)FootlingKneeComplete/flexedDescriptionThighs flexed on the trunk, legs extended at the knee joint.Both thighs and legs are partially extendedPresenting partButtocks and genitaliaFootThighs extended, Knee flexedKneeBoth thighs and legs are flexeButtocks, genitalia, footd.248Varieties of breech presentationFrank breech(breech with extended legs)Complete breech(flexed breech)Footling presentationKnee presentationOMARROWSolution to Question 9:Flexed breech is not an indication for cesarean section in breech presentation. This baby can bedelivered vaginally.Factors favouring cesarean delivery of the breech fetus:• Large fetus (&gt; 3800 to 4000 g)• Severe IUGR••Footling presentation (due to risk of cord prolapse)⚫ Hyperextended head• Contracted pelvis•• Previous cesarean section• Preterm breech•• Primi with breech•Twins, with the first baby in the breech• Lack of surgeon experience• Patient requests for cesarean delivery.Solution to Question 10:A footling breech is a type of incomplete breech presentation with one or more feet below thebreech.Breech presentation can be divided into the following:249••Incomplete: Breech with extended legs, footling or knee presentationComplete: Breech with flexed legsBreech typeDescriptionPresenting partFrank breech(with extended 1egs)Thighs flexed on trunk, legs extended at knee joint.Buttocks and genitaliaFootlingKneeComplete/flexedBoth thighs and legs are parti Footally extendedThighs extended, knee flexedKneeButtocks, genitalia, footBoth thighs and legs are flexed.MMVariotion of broochentationFrank(breech with extended legs)Complete breeoh (flexed breech)Footlina presentationOMARROWSolution to Question 11:Klumpke's paralysis is associated with difficult breech delivery, which is due to hyperabduction ofthe arm during traction and delivery of the fetus. Preeclampsia is not a risk factor for breechpresentation.Risk factors for breech presentation:• Early gestational age• Abnormal amnionic fluid volume• Multifetal gestation• Hydrocephalus•Anencephaly• Uterine anomalies250• Placenta previa• Fundal placental implantation.High parity with uterine relaxation• Prior breech delivery• Prior cesarean delivery• Smoking.Klumpke's paralysis-Damage to C8, T1500OMARROWSupinatedforearmFlexedelbowClaw handSolution to Question 12:The presentation depicted in the image is breech presentation. The most common cause of thispresentation is prematurity.The incidence of breech at term is 3%. At 28 weeks of pregnancy, 20% of women have a breechpresentation. The fetus undergoes spontaneous version usually between 30 - 34 weeks therebycorrecting its position by itself.Persistent breech occurs when this spontaneous version is prevented by any of the followingcauses:•• Intrauterine death of the fetus• Anomalies such as trisomy 13, 18, 21• Anomalies of uterus (septate/bicornuate)• Oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios•Twins•Short cord• Hydrocephalus• Placenta previa251• Contracted pelvisRecurrent/habitual breech is when breech recurs in 3 or more pregnancies. It is usually due touterine anomalies and cornufundal attachment of the placenta.Solution to Question 13:Placenta previa is an absolute contraindication for external cephalic version (ECV).Relative contraindications for ECV:••early laboroligohydramniosruptured membranes⚫ known nuchal cord•• structural uterine abnormalities•fetal-growth restriction•multifetal gestation•prior abruption or its risk factors⚫ severe pre-eclampsia and hypertension•previous LSCSNote: In twin gestation, with a cephalic-noncephalic presentation, after the delivery of the firsttwin, an internal podalic version or intrapartum external cephalic version can be attempted forthe second non-cephalic twin. However, ECV in this case, can lead to an increased incidence offetal distress when compared with the internal podalic version. Hence, ECV is only a relativecontraindication in twin pregnancy.Previous LSCS is a relative contraindication for ECV. However, it is not attempted often andneeds to be performed with caution.Solution to Question 14:The given examination findings are suggestive of transverse lie. The likely fetal presentation isshoulder presentation.The most common cause of transverse lie is prematurity. In term pregnancy, it is commonly seenin patients with placenta previa. Although the most common cause of cord prolapse is transverselie, hand prolapse is also frequently seen in such conditions. The transverse lie is managed by thecaesarean section.In a twin pregnancy, management of 1st twin with a transverse lie is caesarean section whereasthe 2nd twin is managed by internal podalic version.252Solution to Question 15:In a breech presentation, chin to pubis delivery can be done by Prague manoeuvre.Rarely, the back of the fetus fails to rotate to the anterior. In such cases, rotation of the posteriorlyoriented back of the fetus to the anterior may be achieved by using stronger traction on the fetallegs or bony pelvis.If this still does not succeed, the fetus still may be delivered using the modified Praguemanoeuvre. This consists of two fingers of one hand grasping the shoulders of the back-downfetus from below while the other hand draws the feet up and over the maternal abdomen.If the back is oriented anteriorly, extraction may be accomplished using the Mauriceau manoeuvreand delivering the fetus back down.Modified Prague maneuver©MARROWSolution to Question 16:Delivery of the aftercoming head in breech is not done with the help of Keilland's forceps. Theseforceps are used for the rotation of the fetal head. It is not used anymore.The methods used for delivery of the aftercoming head include the following:Burns-Marshall manoeuvre: When the occiput is seen under the pubic symphysis, steady tractionis given on the feet. The baby is swung in an arc towards the mother's abdomen. Simultaneoussuprapubic pressure is given and the head is born by flexion.253Malar flexion and shoulder traction (modified Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit technique):The baby is placed on the supinated left forearm (preferred) with the limbs hanging on either side.The middle and the index fingers of the left hand are placed over the malar bones. The ring andlittle fingers of the pronated right hand are placed on the child's right shoulder. The index fingeris placed on the left shoulder and the middle finger is placed on the suboccipital region.Traction is now given in a downward and backward direction till the nape of the neck is visibleunder the pubic arch. The assistant gives suprapubic pressure during the period to maintainflexion. The fetus is carried in an upward and forward direction toward the mother's abdomenreleasing the face and brow. Lastly, the trunk is depressed to release the occiput and vertex.Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit ManeuverOMARROWThe image below shows Piper's forceps, identified by its distinct perineal curve.254Piper forcepsMAMOVINMARROWAKMSolution to Question 17:The management of entrapment of aftercoming head does not involve Kristellar manoeuvre.Kristeller manoeuvre is the application of uterine fundal pressure during the second stage oflabour to shorten the second stage of labour. This should be used sparingly used as it leads toavulsion of the levator ani.An incompletely dilated cervix will constrict around the neck and impede the delivery of theaftercoming head in breech.Management options:With gentle traction on the fetal body, the cervix may be manually slipped over the occiput.255If this is not successful, then Dührssen incisions may be necessary. These are a set of threeincisions in the cervix:• Can be made at the 2 and 10 o'clock position on the cervix. An additional incision at the 6 o'clockposition is sometimes needed.•⚫ Done for delivery of aftercoming head in breech or delivery of head through an incompletelydilated cervix.•There is a significant risk of haemorrhage; the cervical incision may extend upwards within thebroad ligament causing broad ligament haematoma.Other alternatives include intravenous nitroglycerin, typically 100 µg, to provide cervicalrelaxation. General anaesthesia with halogenated agents is another option.As a last resort, the following methods are used:•• Zavanelli manoeuvre: It involves the replacement of the fetal head into the pelvis followed bycesarean delivery. This is performed for the protruding head and intractable shoulder dystocia.Symphysiotomy: The intervening symphyseal cartilage and ligamentous supports are cut towiden the symphysis pubis. It is also used to aid the delivery of an entrapped aftercoming head.•Solution to Question 18:Breech identified for the first time during delivery is not a contraindication for normal delivery.Vaginal breech delivery is considered when:• Fetal weight is between 1.5 kg and 3.5 kg• There is an adequate pelvis• The presentation is frank breech• The fetal head is flexed256• There are no medical or obstetric complications• Facilities for emergency cesarean section are available (anesthetists, neonatologists) (option B)•• Facilities for continuous labor monitoring are available (option",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The most common complication seen in face to pubis delivery is complete perineal tears.In face to pubis delivery, the occiput is posterior, and therefore, the largest biparietal diameter(9.4 cm) distends the perineum rather than the smaller bitemporal diameter (8 cm). A liberalepisiotomy helps to avoid perineal tears.259",
