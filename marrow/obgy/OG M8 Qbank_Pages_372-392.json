The next step in the management is to confirm the diagnosis withtransvaginal ultrasound (TVS) as the patient is stable.Transabdominal ultrasound (TAS) is used to detect the cause of APH.If the placenta is in the lower uterine segment on TAS, confirmation of placenta previa is done byTVS. TVS provides a clearer image of the relationship between the edge of the placenta and theinternal cervical os than TAS.Approach to placenta previa after confirmation with TVS:• Minor placenta previa - repeat USG at 36 weeks.•Major placenta previa or accreta - USG at 32 weeks followed by elective caesarean deliveryBleeding present - individual managementOn TAS, if the placenta is in the upper uterine segment with evidence of retroplacental blood clot,abruptio placenta is suspected.Per vaginal examination in placenta previa must not be done as it may further separate theplacenta and cause excessive bleeding. However, transvaginal ultrasound is safe as long as theprobe is 2-3 cm away from the cervix.",

It canbe seen in conditions associated with severe fetal anemia like:• Anti-D allo-immunisation• Fetal-maternal haemorrhage••Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome•• Ruptured vasa previa• Acute fetal hypoxia• Infection390• Cardiac malformations• Hydrocephalus• GastroschisisSinusoidal pattern on CTG:18016014012010080Sinusoidal pattern60MA1801601401201008060Fetal heart rate18016014012010080OW60100100808010080606060404040202020000Uterine contractionsOMARROWManagement of vasa previa:• No bleeding• 28-32 weeks antenatal corticosteroids-• 30-34 weeks - admission for surveillance• ≥37 weeks - elective caesarean section• Bleeding present.• Emergency caesarean sectionNote: Vagos method is used in the management of umbilical cord prolapse.",
