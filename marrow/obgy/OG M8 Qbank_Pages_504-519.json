      "explanation": "The best technique for managing the second stage of labor in a patient with heart disease is usingventouse.For most cardiac patients, vaginal delivery is preferred and cesarean section is reserved forobstetric indications since the cesarean section is associated with more blood loss and higherthromboembolic and infection risk. If vaginal delivery is selected as the mode of choice, it will beconducted with the laboring woman in an upright position, or in the left decubitus position. Thisminimizes aortocaval compression.Active pushing during the second stage may also be limited, depending on the degree of cardiaccompromise. In moderate to severe cardiac disease, it may be prudent to completely avoid anactive second stage. Regional anesthesia can be used to allow the fetal head to descend to theperineum without active pushing. Delivery can be further facilitated by forceps or vacuumextraction.The benefit of avoiding hemodynamic fluctuations resulting from pushing must be weighedagainst an increased risk of perineal trauma, hemorrhage, and fetal head injury with forceps orvacuum delivery.Some journals report that ventouse is preferable to forceps, as it can be applied without puttingthe patient in lithotomy position (raising the legs increases the cardiac load) however it iscontroversial.",

So in case of a shunt lesion, only general anesthesia shouldbe given.Note: Aortic stenosis will also be affected by the hypotension caused by epidural/spinal analgesia.However, in aortic stenosis, slow epidural anesthesia is adequate and doesn't compromiseventricular preload.

Otherproposed causes include viral myocarditis, abnormal immune response to pregnancy,malnutrition, inflammation, etc.PPCM is associated with increased secretion of prolactin by the pituitary and antiangiogenicmolecule sFlt-1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase) by the placenta at term gestation.Pearson's diagnostic criteria for PPCM:• Development of cardiac failure in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months after delivery• Absence of an identifiable cause for the cardiac failure• Absence of recognizable heart disease prior to the last month of pregnancy, and• Left ventricular systolic dysfunction demonstrated by echocardiographic criteria, such asejection fraction &lt;45% or fractional shortening &lt;30% along with a dilated left ventricle.Management involves treating the features of heart failure.
