      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Anencephaly is not seen in the case of accidental conception in a woman using the rhythmmethod. It occurs due to deficiency of folic acid in the mother.The calendar method or the rhythm method is one of the natural methods of contraception byfertility awareness. The couple is advised avoidance of sexual intercourse around ovulation. Thus,it is very cost-effective but it can only be used by educated couples.According to this method, safe period in a normal 28-day cycle is from the 1st day of menstrualperiod to the 10th day and from the 18th to the 28th day. An alternate method is by calculatingthe risk period i.e., 3 days before and 3 days after ovulation. Ovulation can also be estimated bychanges in cervical mucus and basal body temperature.Another method of calculating the safe period is the Knaus-Ogino method. The fertile period isdetermined by subtracting 18 days from the shortest cycle and 10 days from the longest cycle.This gives the first and the last day of the fertile period, respectively.",

      "explanation": "Billing's method of contraception refers to the cervical mucus method. It is also called ovulationmethod.The properties of the cervical mucus change during the menstrual cycle. The female partner canpredict the fertile period by examining her cervical mucus.Under the influence of estrogen, the mucus increases in quantity and becomes more slippery andelastic i.e. wet days. This continues till it reaches a peak. After this, under the influence ofprogesterone, it becomes thicker, scanty i.e. dry days.Abstinence is advised during the wet days till 4 days after the peak day. The safe period includesthe dry days after menses till the appearance of mucus and from the 4th day after the peak day.The pattern of cervical mucus secretion during a menstrual cycle is given below.Billing's cervical mucus method28272625Drydays2423222120SafeMensesMenstruation7SafeBDrydays19UnsafeOvulation18171216151413AbstinencePeakdayMARROW67910Mucussymptomsbegin",

At the same time, progestogen causes atrophic changes in the endometrium and682prevents implantation.Progestogen also acts on the cervical mucus making it thick and tenacious and impenetrable bysperms. It also interferes with tubal motility and alters tubal transport., so the fertilized egg reaches the uterine cavity before the endometrium is receptive forimplantation.These tablets are taken starting on the first day of the cycle for 21 days.

      "explanation": "Minipills or progesterone-only pills (POP) do not kill sperm in the cervical canal.Progesterone-only pills act by thickening the cervical mucus (the main mechanism of all POPS684except cerazette) that inhibits penetration of sperms, inhibiting tubal motility, and suppressingovulation.Other advantages of POPs include a reduction in the incidence of pelvic inflammatory diseasesand sexually transmitted diseases (due to thickened cervical mucus).Due to the inhibition of tubal motility, the absolute risk of all pregnancies including ectopicpregnancy decreases, while the relative risk of ectopic pregnancy increases. But a previous historyof ectopic pregnancy is not a contraindication for POP.POPS do not affect clotting, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism. So they can safely beused by women who are obese, breastfeeding, hypertensive, have SLE or a history ofthromboembolism, diabetic with vascular disease. Significant adverse effects of POPs are irregularbleeding (mostly scanty), and secondary amenorrhea after longtime usage as it causes endometrialatrophy.Contraindications for POPS include undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, pregnancy, known or suspectedbreast cancer, and benign or malignant liver tumors.",

      "explanation": "Essure permanent device is a method of hysteroscopic sterilization. Pomeroy, Parkland, andIrving procedures are methods for tubal ligation via an abdominal approach.Essure device consists of a micro-inserter with a flexible inner coil made of stainless steel and adynamic outer coil made of nickel titanium alloy (nitinol).This device is inserted into the fallopian tube by hysteroscopy. It acts by benign local fibroustissue growth leading to occlusion of the tube. The failure rate is 3.5%.Its advantages are that there is no abdominal scar and the procedure can be done under localanaesthesia.Disadvantages of Essure:•Hysteroscopy required for the procedure and to confirm the blockage• Expensive procedure•Expertise required• Irreversible tuboplasty for reversal not possible-• 3 months waiting time to ensure sterility - HSG must be done after 3 months to confirm tubalblockage• Bilateral insertion difficult due to spasm• Can cause perforation of the tubeEssure deviceScar tissue growsinto the Essure deviceOMARROWFallopian tubeEssure device692",

One single incision is made with special forcepsand skin stitch is not required. Clips and plugs can be applied over the vas instead of cutting.The sperms can remain in the reproductive tract for up to 3 months. Hence, sterility is notimmediate. The couple must abstain from intercourse during this period or use other methods ofcontraception.Approximately, 20 ejaculates clear the semen of all sperms.

      "explanation": "Levonorgestrel (LNG) 1.5 mg i.e. 2 tablets of LNG 0.75 mg can be used as a single dose emergencycontraceptive. This should be taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse.Alternatively, one tablet of LNG 0.75mg can be followed by another tablet 12 hours later. Thetablets can be offered up to 120 hours but the efficacy decreases with the increase in intervalbetween coitus and drug intake.LNG prevents ovulation and makes endometrium unsuitable for implantation.
