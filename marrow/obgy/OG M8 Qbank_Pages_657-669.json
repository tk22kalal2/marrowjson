      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given clinical history of excessive growth of coarse hair is suggestive of hirsutism. The mostcommon cause for hirsutism in female patients is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).Hirsutism is defined as excessive growth of androgen-dependent sexual hair or male distributionof hair in female patients. PCOS accounts for 70-80% of the cases of hirsutism, which typicallybegins in late adolescence or the early 20s.Idiopathic hirsutism is the second most frequent cause. The most common rapid onset ofhirsutism in young females is a testosterone-producing tumour like granulosa cell orSertoli-Leydig cell tumours.•Other less common causes of hirsutism include:⚫ Late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia•Tumours of the ovary and adrenal gland• Cushing's syndrome• Drug-inducedVirilisation: Characterized by more extensive androgen-induced changes than hirsutism alone. Ithas the following features:••Acne• Increased oily skin•Temporal balding• Clitoromegaly•• Deepening of the voice• Development of male muscular pattern and body habitus•Atrophy of breastsHypertrichosis: Excessive growth of non-sexual hair.",

The Ferriman-Gallwey score is used toclinically assess and quantify the degree of hirsutism.Within this system, abnormal hair distribution is assessed at nine body areas and each of themscored from 0-4.

Moderate to663severe hirsutism is present if the score is ≥15.Note: Ferriman Gallwey score originally had 11 sites which were modified later to exclude 2 sites,viz., forearm, and legs.",

It restores the endocrine milieu andimproves fertility for a year or so. Thereafter, pelvic adhesions caused by surgery may againreduce the fertility rate. The formation of adhesions can be reduced by hydrofloatation.The advantages of surgery are as follows:•⚫ Tubal testing with chromotubation can be performed simultaneously• Other causes of infertility like endometriosis can be looked for• One-time treatment• Intense and prolonged monitoring for side effects is not required• Cost-effective compared to IVF• Reduces androgen and LH production667• Following surgery, single ovulation occurs with drugs, and hyperstimulation and multiplepregnancies are avoided• Ovulation occurs in 80-90% and pregnancy in 60-70%The disadvantages of surgery are as follows:• It involves giving anaesthesia and performing an invasive procedure like laparoscopy• Adhesions may form postoperatively.• If cautery is used, premature ovarian failure due to destruction of ovarian tissue may be seen",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The image showing enlarged ovaries with multiple large cysts along with the history of treatmentfor infertility with human menopausal gonadotropin suggests the diagnosis of ovarianhyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).Human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) is a medication that is composed of FSH and LH. It isused to stimulate the release of ova in women who do not ovulate spontaneously. It can leadto ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) is a condition associated with ovarian enlargementdue to exogenous gonadotropin therapy. Symptoms include abdominal pain, distention, ascites,gastrointestinal problems, respiratory compromise, oliguria, and thromboembolism. It can occurduring ovulation induction or in early pregnancies conceived through exogenous ovarianstimulation.Predisposing factors for OHSS include multi-follicular ovaries (such as in PCOS), young age, highestradiol levels during ovulation induction, and pregnancy.Vasoactive substances produced by the corpus luteum, such as vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) and angiotensin II, are believed to contribute to enhanced capillarypermeability, resulting in the loss of fluid, protein, and electrolytes into the peritoneal cavity andhemoconcentration.Sonographic examination reveals enlarged ovaries with numerous follicular cysts and ascites.Maintaining fluid balance with isotonic fluids like normal saline is crucial. Strategies to preventOHSS during exogenous ovulation include reducing follicular stimulation (low FSH dose),coasting (withholding FSH administration one or more days prior to the hCG trigger),prophylactic volume expanders, and substituting hCG for FSH towards the end of ovarianstimulation.Other options:Option B: Theca lutein cysts are a rare form of follicular cysts characterized by luteinization andhypertrophy of the theca interna layer. Both ovaries are enlarged and cystic. This condition iscommonly associated with gestational trophoblastic disease, multifetal gestation, andplacentomegaly.Option C: Polycystic ovarian syndrome shows 12 or more small follicles each 2-9 mm in sizeplaced peripherally (necklace pattern) (shown below).

Majority of women (80%) with high prolactin levels present with galactorrhoea.However, some hyperprolactinemic women may not have this symptom.Normal prolactin level is 25 ng/mL and levels more than this can cause galactorrhoea. Levels up to100 ng/mL occur in hyperprolactinaemia but prolactin level over 100 ng/mL is seen in pituitarytumours.Galactorrhoea is caused by pituitary adenoma and hyperprolactinemia. The condition isassociated with amenorrhoea, oligomenorrhoea and infertility. The drug of choice for thiscondition is cabergoline.669",
