Hence, it is now an optional component of AMTSL that is done in patients with uterineatony as a part of the management of PPH.AMTSL is recommended by the WHO to prevent postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Uterotonics arethe most important components in AMTSL to do so.The currently recommended components of AMTSL are as follows:405Note: In the event that uterine atony is diagnosed during the assessment of uterine tone, uterinemassage can be performed to control PPH.1.234Injectinguterotonicswithin1minuteof delivery of the babyor immediately after deliveryof theanterior shoulderDelayed cord clampingDelivery of placenta by controlled cord traction: ModifiedBrandt Andrews techniqueIntermittent assessment of uterine toneMost importantstepOxytocin10 IU im/iv infusion is thepreferred uterotonic.

Then it is looped over thefundus to go posterior. Another bite is taken posteriorly. Then it is looped back over the fundusand taken anteriorly.

      "question": "In a patient with hydramnios complicating pregnancy, the third stage of labour was managedby applying fundal pressure and controlled traction of the cord. On palpation, the uterus wasstill soft and boggy. Within a few minutes, there was moderate bleeding per vaginumfollowing which a reddish-purple mass was expelled. The patient then developed hypotension,bradycardia and went into shock. What is the most probable diagnosis?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The most probable diagnosis is uterine inversion.Hydramnios is a risk factor for uterine inversion due to uterine over-distension. Fundal pressurewhile the uterus is atonic (soft, relaxed, and boggy) causes uterine inversion. It results inhaemorrhage followed by complete uterine inversion protruding out of the vulva. Neurogenic typeof shock develops due to stretching of the infundibulopelvic ligament and the ovaries.Option A: Amniotic fluid embolism causes cardiac arrest, acute hypoxia and severe haemorrhage.Option B: There was only moderate bleeding per vaginum and soft uterus. But since there isprotrusion of the uterus per vaginum, the most probable diagnosis is uterine inversion.Option D: Placenta accreta rarely causes uterine inversion.Uterine inversion is an extremely rare but life-threatening complication in the 3rd stage of labor,in which the uterus is turned inside out partially or completely.Causes:• Most common cause is mismanagement of 3rd stage of labour414• Spontaneous• Placenta accreta (rarely)Features:• Shock immediately after delivery• The degree of shock is out of proportion to the amount of bleeding• Shock is either neurogenic or hemorrhagic• Per abdomen examination fundus of the uterus is not palpable.Management of uterine inversion:Vaginal operationsKustnerAbdominal operationsHuntingtonsSpinelliHaultainHydrostatic methodO SullivanOguch",
