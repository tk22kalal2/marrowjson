      "explanation": "The absence of withdrawal bleeding after the estrogen-progesterone challenge test points towardsa local endometrial lesion.Estrogen-progesterone challenge test is indicated as an investigation in case of secondaryamenorrhea. It depends on estrogen-primed endometrium being present in the uterus.Procedure:• Ethinyl estradiol 0.02 mg or conjugated equine estrogen 1.25 mg is to be taken daily for 25 days.Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg daily is added from day 15–25.••Alternately, one course of oral contraceptive pill is given and to observe whether withdrawalbleeding occurs or not.Results:• If there is no bleeding, a local endometrial lesion is present such as uterine synechiae. This is tobe confirmed by HSG or hysteroscopy.• If withdrawal bleeding occurs, the endometrium is responsive but the endogenous estrogenproduction is inadequate. Hence, the defect lies in the ovary, hypothalamus, or pituitary.560",

Pregnancy complications such as miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies,and molar pregnancies may present with AUB, hence these need to be ruled out by urineẞ-hCG levels. This is done for all women in the reproductive age group.Other investigations to be done for AUB are:-• Pap smear to rule out cervical cancer and preinvasive lesions (CIN).• Transabdominal ultrasound - to visualize the pelvic organs and lesions such as endometrialhyperplasia, polyps, fibroids, etc.• Transvaginal ultrasound - to visualize the pelvic organs. It is done after evaluating ẞ-hCG. This ismore comfortable for a patient compared to a transabdominal ultrasound as it doesn't require afull bladder.",

It refers to the absence of menstruation thatcan be physiological or pathological.Primary amenorrhea is defined as an absence of menstruation by the age of 15 years. At age 13years, if no menses have occurred and there is a complete absence of secondary sexualcharacteristics such as breast development, evaluation for primary amenorrhea shouldbegin. Mullerian agenesis (MRKH syndrome), androgen insensitivity syndrome, and Turnersyndrome present with primary amenorrhea. In Turner's syndrome, gonadal dysgenesis causesprimary ovarian failure, resulting in hypogonadism and amenorrhea.Secondary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menses for 3 or more months or fewer than 9cycles per year after the establishment of regular menstrual cycles. Polycystic ovarian syndromeand hypothyroidism are associated with secondary amenorrhea. Pregnancy is the most commonphysiological cause of secondary amenorrhea.Solution to Question 2:The absence of withdrawal bleeding after the estrogen-progesterone challenge test points towardsa local endometrial lesion.Estrogen-progesterone challenge test is indicated as an investigation in case of secondaryamenorrhea. It depends on estrogen-primed endometrium being present in the uterus.Procedure:• Ethinyl estradiol 0.02 mg or conjugated equine estrogen 1.25 mg is to be taken daily for 25 days.Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg daily is added from day 15–25.••Alternately, one course of oral contraceptive pill is given and to observe whether withdrawalbleeding occurs or not.Results:• If there is no bleeding, a local endometrial lesion is present such as uterine synechiae. This is tobe confirmed by HSG or hysteroscopy.• If withdrawal bleeding occurs, the endometrium is responsive but the endogenous estrogenproduction is inadequate. Hence, the defect lies in the ovary, hypothalamus, or pituitary.560Solution to Question 3:The risk of developing Asherman syndrome is the highest if D&amp;C is done for postpartumhemorrhage.This is because the postpartum uterus is larger and bulkier. Hence, a greater area of the uterinewall is curetted. This increases the risk of developing Asherman syndrome.Asherman syndrome is the presence of uterine synechiae, due to the destruction of large areas ofthe endometrium. The treatment of Asherman syndrome is by hysteroscopic adhesiolysis.Solution to Question 4:Oligomenorrhoea can progress to develop into amenorrhoea.Oligomenorrhoea means infrequent, irregularly timed episodes of bleeding usually occurring atintervals of more than 38 days.Solution to Question 5:The given case scenario is suggestive of polymenorrhoea, also known as epimenorrhea. It refersto frequent episodes of menstruation, usually occurring at intervals of 21 days or less.The definitions of various menstrual cycle irregularities are:Amenorrhoea refers to the absence of menstruation.Intermenstrual bleeding refers to occasional episodes of bleeding (usually not excessive) thatoccur between otherwise normal menstrual cycles.Hypomenorrhea refers to regularly timed cycles, but having scanty episodes of bleeding.Menorrhagia refers to regularly timed menstrual cycles with excessive bleeding (&gt;80 mL inamount) and/or increased duration of flow (&gt;8 days).Metrorrhagia refers to normal cyclical bleeding with superimposed irregularly timed episodes ofbleeding.Menometrorrhagia refers to excessive, prolonged bleeding that occurs at irregularly timed andfrequent intervals.Oligomenorrhea refers to infrequent, irregularly timed cycles with intervals of more than 38 days.Precocious menstruation refers to the occurrence of menstruation before the age of 10 years.Solution to Question 6:561Menorrhagia is defined as heavy but regular menstrual bleeding.Menorrhagia denotes regularly timed episodes of bleeding that are excessive in amount (&gt;80mL) and/or duration of flow (&gt;8 days). Nowadays, menorrhagia has been replaced by the termheavy menstrual bleeding. This is defined as greater than 80 mL per cycle, which will result inanemia if recurrentInvestigations done in case of menorrhagia:•Complete blood count (CBC) - to rule out anemia and thrombocytopenia.Coagulation studies are ordered only in case of clinical suspicion and correlation with CBC• Sonohysterography/Hysteroscopy to diagnose endometrial polyps and fibroids-• Endometrial biopsy - in case of suspected endometrial hyperplasia• Transvaginal ultrasound - supplements biopsySolution to Question 7:Hormonal therapy is the next best step in the given scenario of menorrhagia that is unresponsiveto non-hormonal therapy.Menorrhagia/heavy menstrual bleeding is defined as heavy but regular menstrual bleeding,&gt;80mL of blood loss, or &gt;8 days of bleeding per menstrual period. It can be acute (&lt;6months) or chronic (&gt;6 months).It is managed as follows:• Medical first line of treatment.• NSAIDS-• Tranexamic acid⚫ OCPs/progestogens - if non-hormonal management fails•• Mirena IUCD• GnRH agonists• Blood transfusion, if required•••Surgical - if medical management fails, depending on the diagnosis:Endometrial ablation - hysteroscopic, TCRE, RITEA, microwave, NovaSure, etc (option B)• Uterine artery embolization (option",
      "options": {
        "A": "• Uterine tamponade• Hysterectomy - if all minimally invasive methods fail (option D)Solution to Question 8:Menometrorrhagia refers to menstrual bleeding at frequent intervals.562Menometrorrhagia means excessive, prolonged bleeding that occurs at irregularly timed andfrequent intervals. It can be caused by cervical cancer and granulosa cell tumors.Solution to Question 9:In the given clinical scenario, the pattern of bleeding is called hypomenorrhea. Hypomenorrheaalong with a prior history of dilatation and curettage are suggestive of partial Asherman'ssyndrome.Hypomenorrhoea refers to regularly timed but scanty episodes of bleeding. It can be seen in:• Partial Asherman's syndrome - uterine synechiae, causing scarring• Oral contraceptive use• Perimenopausal age groupSolution to Question 10:The given case scenario is suggestive of intermenstrual bleeding, also known as metrorrhagia.Usually, this is scanty, and not excessive.Intermenstrual bleeding or metrorrhagia refers to irregularly timed episodes of bleedingsuperimposed on normal cyclical bleeding. It can be caused by:• Ovulation (physiological)• Polyps•Cervical cancer• Lower genital tract infections etc.Solution to Question 11:Precocious menstruation refers to the occurrence of menstruation before the age of 10 years.Precocious puberty in a girl is the appearance of any of the secondary sexual characteristics beforethe age of 8 years or the occurrence of menarche before the age of 10 years.McCune Albright syndrome is associated with cafe-au-lait spots, precocious puberty (andprecocious menstruation), and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia leading to recurrent fractures. Theimage given below shows cafe-au-lait spots.563Solution to Question 12:The given case scenario is suggestive of metropathia hemorrhagica.Metropathia hemorrhagica is a form of anovulatory abnormal uterine bleeding. It is characterizedby continuous painless vaginal bleeding at the onset of menses or preceded by a 6-8 week periodof amenorrhea. It is usually seen in the age group of 40-45 years. A history of menorrhagia may bepresent.On examination, the uterus is bulky and uniformly enlarged. Histopathological findings are:•Myohyperplasia of the uterine wall - up to 2.5cm• Thick endometrium with cystic glandular hyperplasia appearing as swiss cheese pattern•Absence of secretory endometrium i.e absence of corkscrew glands•• Thin, slender endometrial polyps project into the uterine cavity•Corpus luteum is absent•One or both ovaries may contain a cystOption A: Senile endometritis occurs after menopause when the endometrium is thin andatrophic. It may be associated with accumulation of pus in the uterine cavity.Option B: Halban's disease is irregular shedding and is due to persistent corpus luteum. Regularcycles with prolonged bleeding and normal flow is present.Option D: Endometriosis usually presents in the reproductive age group, with symptoms ofmenorrhagia, dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain.Solution to Question 13:564The 'I' in the FIGO PALM-COEIN classification for abnormal uterine bleeding (AU",
        "B": "stands foriatrogenic causes.AUB in the reproductive age group was previously known as dysfunctional uterine bleeding,however, that term is now obsolete. AUB can be acute or chronic:• Acute AUB - it can start sporadically or be superimposed on chronic AUB.• Chronic AUB - it lasts for 3-6 months minimum.PALM-COEIN classification of AUB:•Polyp (AUB-P):•Endometrial polyps• Endocervical polyps• Adenomyosis (AUB-A)• Leiomyoma (AUB-L). Fibroids are further classified as:• Submucosal (SM)Other (O)• Malignancy and hyperplasia (AUB-M)• Endometrial hyperplasia• Endometrial carcinoma•Coagulopathy (AUB-",
        "C": "• von Willebrand's disease• Hemophilias• Ovarian causes (AUB-O)• PCOD•Hypothyroidism• Hyperprolactinemia.• Endometrial causes (AUB-E)•⚫ Tubercular or chlamydial endometritis• Iatrogenic causes (AUB-I)•Intrauterine contraceptive devices• Anticoagulants• Tricyclic antidepressants• Not yet classified (AUB-N) includes rare causes such as• Arteriovenous malformations• Myometrial hypertrophy565Solution to Question 14:The first investigation to be done in a case of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in the reproductiveage group is urine ẞ-hCG estimation. This is done to rule out pregnancy.In the reproductive age group, anovulatory uterine bleeding is encountered less often. Therefore,pregnancy must be excluded. Pregnancy complications such as miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies,and molar pregnancies may present with AUB, hence these need to be ruled out by urineẞ-hCG levels. This is done for all women in the reproductive age group.Other investigations to be done for AUB are:-• Pap smear to rule out cervical cancer and preinvasive lesions (CIN).• Transabdominal ultrasound - to visualize the pelvic organs and lesions such as endometrialhyperplasia, polyps, fibroids, etc.• Transvaginal ultrasound - to visualize the pelvic organs. It is done after evaluating ẞ-hCG. This ismore comfortable for a patient compared to a transabdominal ultrasound as it doesn't require afull bladder.Solution to Question 15:Fertility is not preserved with ablative procedures, because the endometrium and superficialmyometrium are destroyed.In ablative procedures, the uterus is preserved, and hysterectomy is avoided. The endometriumalong with 2-3mm of superficial myometrium is destroyed.Various methods of endometrial ablation include:•Hysteroscopic endometrial ablation• Transcervical endometrial resection (TCRE) - now replaced by bipolar electrode calledVersapoint•Radiofrequency induced thermal ablation (RITEA)• Microwave ablation• NovaSure - impedance-controlled endometrial ablation• Bilateral uterine artery embolization• Uterine tamponadeSolution to Question 16:Dilatation and curettage (D&amp;C) is contraindicated in pelvic inflammatory disease (PI",
        "D": "as itincreases the risk of ascending genital infection.D&amp;C is a minor gynecological procedure of dilating the cervix and curetting the endometrialtissue from the uterine cavity. Diagnostic indications of D&amp;C include AUB, secondary566amenorrhea to detect tubercular endometritis, postmenopausal bleeding to rule out endometrialcancer or hyperplasia, and infertility due to genital TB.Therapeutic indications of D&amp;C include missed abortion, incomplete abortion, retainedproducts of conception, and endometrial polypectomy.Absolute contraindication of D&amp;C includes Suspected/ desired pregnancy and lower genitaltract infection. However, D&amp;C is performed in some cases with genital infections like septicabortion (where retained pieces of placenta act as a nidus and need to be removed) and pyometra(as there is cervical obstruction with superinfection of menstrual blood and cellular debris,D&amp;C is appropriate to remove the obstruction as well as the source of infection)Complications of D&amp;C include ascending infection, cervical tear with bleeding, incompetentos, uterine perforation, and ashermann syndrome.SCO MARROVSolution to"
