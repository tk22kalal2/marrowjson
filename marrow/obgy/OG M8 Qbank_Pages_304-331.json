      "explanation": "Same sex twins of the same blood group are not always monozygotic but can also be dizygotictwins as well. The genetic relationship between dizygotic twins is the same as any siblings.Option A: More the number of embryos transferred in IVF, more is the risk of twinning. Hence,single embryo transfer is being recommended by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine(2017) to prevent twin gestation.Option B: Isograft is done between monozygotic twins as they have HLA homology.Option C: Twins of the opposite sex are usually dizygotic. Rarely, somatic mutations orchromosomal aberrations can change the sex of 1 or both of the monozygotic twins.",

It can occur even after artificialreproductive therapy. Hence, after embryo transfer, intercourse must be avoided. Heteropaternalsuperfecundation is used to refer to instances of two different males fathering fraternal twins.This leads to the possibility of twins also being half-siblings. This may give rise to the doubt ofadultery and infidelity.Superfetation is the fertilization of two ova released in different menstrual cycles. This is not seenin humans.

This is done using the membrane thickness at thesite of insertion of the amniotic membrane into the placenta. The T■sign (in monochorionictwins) or lambda sign (in dichorionic twins) can be seen here. As the determination of chorionicityis most accurate when the amnion and chorion have not yet been fused, the first trimester scanin twin pregnancy is highly important.Markers of dichorionicity include 4 layers of membranes between the twins, membrane thickness&gt;2mm, different sex of twins, 2 different placentas, and positive twin peak sign.Women with an uncomplicated dichorionic twin pregnancy should have a first trimester scan, adetailed second trimester scan, and scans every 4 weeks thereafter.Women with uncomplicated monochorionic twins should have a first trimester scan and thenscans every 2 weeks from 16 weeks onwards.

Both artery-artery and vein-vein anastomosis can be seen inTRAP.TRAP is a placental vascular anastomotic complication seen in monochorionic twins. In thisdisorder, deoxygenated blood from the donor twin enters the recipient twin through theanastomosis and supplies the lower half of the recipient's body. Hence, the heart and upper bodyof the recipient is poorly developed.The below image depicts the circulation pattern seen in TRAP.Based on the supply of deoxygenated blood, the recipient twin might have the following fates:The donor twin develops high output cardiac failure.The treatment for this condition is radiofrequency ablation of the acardiac or recipient twin.FateTypeLower body is perfused with f Acardius acephalusailed head growthPartially developed head withAcardius myelecephalidentifiable limbsus326FateTypeNo recognizable structureAcardius amorphous",

      "explanation": "The given specimen depicts a monochorionic monoamniotic pregnancy as:• 2 umbilical cords are arising from 1 placenta (monochorionic)• No intervening amniotic membrane is attached to the placenta. This means that both fetusesmust have been inside a single amniotic cavity (monoamniotic).Option B: In Monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy, on gross examination, there will be 1 placentaand intervening 2 layers of amnion attached to the placenta. In this type of pregnancy, each fetuswill have its own amniotic cavity (diamniotic) with a shared placenta (monochorionic). This isseen if the fertilized zygote divides into 2 between 4-8 days.The below given gross image of monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy shows two umbilical cordsarising separately from the placenta with the intervening amniotic membrane held by the forceps.327Option D: In dichorionic diamniotic pregnancy each fetus has it's own amnion &amp; chorion.The placentas here may be fused or separate. This is seen in dizygotic twins as well asmonozygotic twins that divide within 0-4 days.Option A: Twin to twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) most commonly complicatesmonochorionic (single placenta) twin pregnancy. In TTTS blood is transfused from the donor twinto the recipient twin through the abnormal vascular connections within the placenta leaving thedonor anemic while the recipient becomes polycythemic.The box below describes the type of amnion and chorion seen in different types of twinsdepending on the time of division.Dizygotic twinsMonozygotic twins- division.occurs withino-4 days4-8 days8-12 days>13 daysDichorionic diamnioticDichorionic diamnioticMonochorionic diamnioticMonochorionic monoamnioticMonochorionic monoamniotic conjoined twins328",
