Theymay also present with preterm delivery, pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR),and fetal death.Criteria for APS include:•⚫ at least one otherwise unexplained fetal death at or beyond 10 weeks;•⚫ at least one preterm birth before 34 weeks gestation because of eclampsia, severe preeclampsia,placental insufficiency; or• at least three unexplained consecutive spontaneous abortions before 10 weeks.Aspirin (60-80mg daily) with heparin (5000-10,000 U subcutaneously every 12h) is the mosteffective therapy for APS. Treating APS with only aspirin (option A) is not recommended asheparin is crucial in preventing thrombus formation at the decidual-thrombotic interface,Corticosteroids (option C, D) should not be used in primary APS (without an associatedconnective tissue disorder) but are indicated in patients with pre-existing systemic lupuserythematosus (SLE) and APS (secondary APS).",

      "explanation": "Misoprostol is given at a dose of 800 mcg by mucosal route for MTP.Mucosal misoprostol administration has increased efficacy and minimizes gastrointestinal sideeffects. Hence, it is preferred over oral administration.WHO guidelines for medical management in induced abortion for &lt;12 weeks of gestation:• Combined regimen (recommended): 200 mg of oral Mifepristone followed 1-2 days later by 800mcg of buccal, vaginal, or sublingual misoprostol• Misoprostol only regimen (alternative): 800 µg misoprostol administered vaginally, sublingually,or buccally",

      "question": "355A 21-year-old woman is brought in a drowsy state from a PHC with complaints of fever,severe lower abdominal pain, and purulent vaginal discharge. Her mother revealed that shehad had an unsafe abortion a week ago. On examination, her abdomen was distended, BP was80/60 mmHg, PR was 140 bpm, and RR was 36 breaths/ minute. Which of the following isnot a causative agent of her present condition?",

        "A": "Streptococcus pyogenes",

        "C": "Clostridium sordellii",
        "D": "Escherichia coli"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) following septicabortion. Escherichia coli can be detected in septic abortion, but it is not a causative agent forTSS.Organisms causing toxic shock syndrome in septic abortion:• Streptococcus pyogenes• Clostridium perfringens• Clostridium sordelliiClinical features of septic abortion:• Fever with chills and rigors••• Abdominal or chest painDiarrhoea and vomiting• Renal angle tenderness⚫ Offensive purulent vaginal discharge.Clinical grading of septic abortion:• Grade I - infection localized in the uterus• Grade II - infection spreads to parametrium, tubes, ovaries, or pelvic peritoneum• Grade III - generalized peritonitis, endotoxic shock, jaundice, or acute renal failureEmpirical antibiotic therapy in septic abortion is started for the broadest microbial coverage.Piperacillin-tazobactam or carbapenem and clindamycin are given intravenously. Antibiotics canbe changed once culture sensitivity reports are available.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Maternal diabetes and hypertension",
        "B": "Illicit drug abuse by the mother",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "An untreated seizure disorder in pregnancy is not a risk factor for stillbirth. However, the use ofcertain anti-epileptic drugs like valproate could lead to the development of neural tube defects inthe baby.Recent studies haven't consistently shown that untreated women with epilepsy face a higher risk,though it's hard to rule out entirely because those who manage without medication usually havemilder symptoms. Recent research found that birth defects were more common in children ofwomen who used anticonvulsants.Risk factors for stillbirth are:• Advanced maternal age•African-American race•Smoking• Illicit drug use370• Maternal medical diseases - overt diabetes or chronic hypertension• Assisted reproductive technology•Nulliparity•Obesity-• Previous adverse pregnancy outcomes prior preterm birth or IUGRNote: Stillbirth rates appear to be slightly increased in pregnancies conceived via assistedreproductive technology.",
