The balloon is inflated to block the backflow of theinfused sterile saline and transvaginal ultrasound is performed to visualize the cavity.It is used:859• To determine the endometrial thickness• To determine the cause in cases of infertility.To identify Mullerian anomalies•To visualize endometrial polyps and pedunculated fibroidsThe image given below shows the appearance of the uterus on SIS.Option A: Transvaginal ultrasound is the initial evaluation for postmenopausal bleeding.Option B: In balloon endometrial ablation, a balloon is inserted into the uterus and inflated withglycine or 5% glucose.

      "explanation": "The next line of management in a patient with increased endometrial thickness is an endometrialbiopsy.In a postmenopausal woman, the normal endometrium should not exceed 4 mm in thickness. If itexceeds 4 mm, then histopathological examination (HPE) of the endometrium is mandatory,irrespective of the presence or absence of symptoms. In a perimenopausal woman, the cutoff fornormal endometrial thickness is 10mm.Hysteroscopy and biopsy is preferred over other blind curettage methods for HPE.
