It can also assess the bladder mucosafor any injuries.The 3-swab test (Option B) is done to identify the types of genitourinary fistula.In this test, three sterile pieces of cotton swabs are serially placed in the vaginal cavity, while50-100ml of methylene blue solution is instilled in the bladder using a catheter.

      "explanation": "In the given scenario, the best time to perform fistula repair is 6 weeks after the inciting surgery.In uncomplicated fistulas, early surgical intervention is preferred within the first 24 to 48 hoursfollowing the inciting surgery. This avoids the brisk postoperative inflammatory response.However, if extensive and severe inflammation is present, repair of fistula can be delayed to 6weeks after the surgery. This is usually done in a patient who has undergone major surgery,During this delay it is ensured that all the tissue inflammation has subsided, tissue vascularisationhas improved and local infection has cleared. Estrogen therapy should be instituted inpostmenopausal women in this time period.In case the fistula repair fails, a second attempt is made only after 3 months.",

The highest incidence of this complicationis seen with Wertheim's hysterectomy.Urinary tract injury occurs almost exclusively in major gynecologic surgery that involves surgicaldissection in proximity to the ureters or bladder. Vaginal hysterectomy tends to have lower ratesof ureteric injuries than open (abdominal, Wertheim) or laparoscopic routes. The highest riskfor ureteric injury is associated with the following procedures:•Surgical debulking of gynecological cancers• Advanced pelvic reconstructive surgery• Laparoscopic hysterectomyPatients with ureteric injuries have a complicated post-operative period. They can present withthe following features:• Fever⚫ Flank pain• Abdominal distension• Prolonged paralytic ileus - bowel sounds are absent.High drain outputs, in case abdominal drains are placed.CT urogram and retrograde pyelography are the investigations of choice. They reveal urinaryextravasation from the ureter. Ureteric injuries are prevented by careful division of tissue planesduring pelvic or genitourinary surgeries.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given case scenario is suggestive of urge incontinence. It occurs due to detrusor instability.During normal micturition, the detrusor muscle contracts after being stimulated by theparasympathetic nerves. In detrusor instability, detrusor muscle contracts spontaneously or onprovocation during filling of the bladder. It is often caused by overactivity of parasympatheticnerves. It is usually seen in older women and is caused by:•Decreased bladder capacity - due to fibrosis• Decreased sensation.• Central nervous system (CNS) inhibition - due to stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cordinvolvement etc.It is associated with the following symptoms:• Incontinence• Urge to urinate• Increased frequency• Nocturia• Urination during sexual intercourse and with the sound of water, hand-washing.588",

      "explanation": "In patient 3, detrusor instability is not seen, as this is a case of functional incontinence.During normal micturition, the detrusor muscle contracts after being stimulated by theparasympathetic nerves. In detrusor instability, detrusor muscle contracts spontaneously or onprovocation during filling of the bladder. It is often caused by the overactivity of parasympatheticnerves. It is seen usually in older women and is caused by:• Decreased bladder capacity - due to fibrosis• Decreased sensation-• Central nervous system (CNS) inhibition due to stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cordinvolvement etc.It is associated with the following symptoms:• Incontinence• Urge to urinate• Increased frequency• Nocturia• Urination during sexual intercourse and with the sound of water, hand-washing.Treatment is initially conservative and include decreasing caffeine intake, smoking cessation, fluidrestriction and weight reduction. Anticholinergic drugs and bladder training may also be tried.Note: Functional incontinence occurs in patients with disabilities, whose bladder movements arenormal. However, due to environmental or physical barriers, involuntary leakage of urine occurs.",
