      "explanation": "The most common site of occurrence of endometriosis is the ovary. Endometriosis of the ovary isknown as endometrioma.By definition, endometriosis is the occurrence of benign endometrial tissue (glands andstroma) outside the cavity of the uterus. Endometriosis can occur anywhere in the body (exceptspleen) including the abdominal wall, lung, pleura, brain, etc.It is a proliferative, hormone-dependent disease of the childbearing period. Women between theage groups of 30-40 years are most commonly affected. Risk factors for endometriosis are asfollows:• Family history (7-10x risk with a 1st-degree relative)• Nulliparity646• In utero exposure to Diethylstilbestrol (DES)• Estrogen dependent conditions/Estrogen therapy• Immunological factor - Impaired T cell and NK cell activity and altered immunology in a womanmay increase the susceptibility to proliferation and growth.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The given clinical history and the image showing characteristic powder burn spots seen over the pelvic peritoneum on laparoscopy point toward a diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis. On laparoscopy, the typical endometriotic lesions appear like small black, dark brown or bluish dots. These are called powder burns or gunshot appearance of the serosal surfaces of the peritoneum. They are nodules or small cysts containing old haemorrhages surrounded by a variable degree of fibrosis. Subtle appearances of endometriosis seen on laparoscopy are: Red flame-shaped areas, Red polypoid areas, Yellow-brown patches, White peritoneal plaques or scarring, Peritoneal defects known as Allen-Masters Syndrome, Subovarian adhesions. The lesions mentioned above are thought to be more active than the powder burn areas. Endometriotic lesions in the peritoneal cavity contain yellowish-brown fluid. This fluid contains prostaglandins that are responsible for the pain associated with this condition. Endometriosis of the ovary leads to formation of the chocolate cyst which is a true cyst with columnar epithelium lining. The image below shows the laparoscopic appearance of endometriotic lesions in the pouch of Douglas and on the right, the sacrouterine ligament. Dyspareunia occurs when the pouch of Douglas and rectovaginal septum are involved.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In endometriotic lesions, histology represents its high estrogen activity. Endometriosis is defined by the presence of 'ectopic' endometrial tissue at a site outside of the uterus. Endometriosis is a proliferative hormone-dependent disease of the childbearing period. It is extremely rare before menarche and disappears after menopause. The endometriotic implants show certain differences when compared to normal endometrium. There is increased production of estrogen by endometriotic stromal cells due to high levels of the enzyme aromatase. This is absent in normal endometrial stroma. Management of endometriosis: Management of symptomatic endometriosis includes minimal invasive, medical, and surgical treatments. Drug treatment includes GnRH analogues, OCPS, Letrozole, Danazol, Gestrinone, and Anti-progesterone (Mifepristone) and Progesterone. Mnemonic: GOLD GAP. Laparoscopy involves destruction by cautery, laser vaporization, excision of cysts, adhesiolysis, and presacral neurectomy (LUNA - laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation). Laparotomy involves incision of chocolate cysts and removal of lining, salpingo-oophorectomy, hysterectomy, and unilateral or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and excision of scar endometriosis.",
