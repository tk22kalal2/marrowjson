This is facilitated by sexuallytransmitted vectors such as sperms and Trichomonas.The mucous membranes of the fallopian tubes are affected first. They become edematous and areinfiltrated with leukocytes and plasma cells. Another route of spread is through the reflux ofmucosal blood.Option A: Hematogenous spread is seen in genital tuberculosis.Option B: Lymphatics are involved in the spread of secondary organisms and in PID followingpost-abortal and puerperal infection.Option C: Parametrium facilitates the spread of Mycoplasma.

Hence, the infection goesunnoticed and untreated. Thus, it can lead to more damage and complications.Gonococcal infection is more symptomatic than chlamydial infection. Hence, it is diagnosed earlyand causes less damage to the tubes than chlamydial infection.Mycoplasma and Mobiluncus generally cause lower genital tract infections like cervicitis andvaginitis.",

However, the damage to the tube remains as chronic pyosalpinx orhydrosalpinx. A hydrosalpinx represents the end result of previous acute salpingitis and is oftenbilateral.The tube becomes retort shaped due to the enormous dilatation of the ampullary region that isfilled with clear fluid.Histological examination shows a flattening of the tubal plicae and exfoliation of the liningepithelium.",

      "explanation": "The treatment of choice for an old multiparous woman with chronic PID is abdominalhysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.A radical hysterectomy involves the removal of the whole uterus, tissue from the sides of theuterus, the cervix, and the upper part of the vagina. It is generally done only in cancer patients.A supracervical hysterectomy involves the removal of only the body of the uterus and is not donein chronic PID. It is done for the treatment of endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and uterineprolapse.",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Long-standing pelvic inflammation may lead to pyometra. This refers to the collection of pus inthe uterine cavity.The initial infection involves the cervix uteri and urethra which may extend to Bartholin glands,skene glands, endometrium, and fallopian tubes. Unilateral pain and swelling over the labia maybe caused by the inflammation of the Bartholin glands.Depending on the extent of tissue involved, PID can be classified into five stages• Stage I - Acute salpingitis without peritonitis - No adhesions••Stage II - Acute salpingitis with peritonitis - purulent dischargeStage III - Acute salpingitis with superimposed tubal occlusion or tubo ovarian complex• Stage IV - Ruptured tubo-ovarian abscess•Stage V - Tubercular salpingitisLong-standing pelvic inflammation may also lead to:⚫ Dyspareunia• Infertility•Ectopic pregnancy• Formation of adhesions like hydrosalpinx, pyosalpinx, tubo-ovarian abscess• Chronic pelvic painNote: Chronic pelvic inflammation leads to dense adhesions between the uterus and theappendages. Thus, it becomes difficult to define the uterus from the pelvic masses. They form ahard mass which is called the frozen pelvis.The most common cause of the spread of PID: Ascending infection along with spermsThe only PID that does not spread with the sexual route is genital TB. It has a hematogenousspread.The most common PID in virgin females is genital TB.Investigation of choice in PID: Abdominal USGThe surest sign of salpingitis is pus extruding from the fimbrial end of the tube.750",
