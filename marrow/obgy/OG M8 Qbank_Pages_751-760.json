        "C": "Retrograde spread",
        "D": "Local spread"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Endometrial tuberculosis is most commonly acquired by direct spread from the fallopiantubes. Hematogenous spread is thought to be the process by which the tubercle bacilli implantinto the mucosa of the fallopian tubes and subsequently affect the endometrium by directextension.Female genital tuberculosis is an important cause of significant morbidity, short and long-termsequelae especially infertility. Genital tuberculosis usually occurs secondary to pulmonary(commonest) or extrapulmonary TB like gastrointestinal, renal, skeletal, and miliary TB. However,primary genital TB can rarely occur in women whose male partners have active genitourinary TB754(e.g., tuberculosis epididymitis) by transmission through infected semenMost common site involved in secondary genital TB is fallopian tube (90-100%) &gt; endometrium(50-80%) &gt;ovaries (20-30%) &gt;cervix 5-15%) &gt;vulva. The most common symptom ofgenital TB is infertility.Causes of infertility in genital TB:⚫ Tubal blockage•• If tubes are patent, then also infertility occurs due to loss of tubal function.•Tubercular endometritis causes uterine scarring resulting in the destruction of the endometrium.Ovarian damage with poor ovarian reserve and volumeA laparoscopy and dye hydrotubation (lap and dye test) is the most reliable tool to diagnosegenital TB, especially for tubal, ovarian and peritoneal disease. The test can be combined withhysteroscopy.Multiple drug therapy (ATT regimen provided by DOTS) in adequate doses and for sufficientduration is the mainstay in the treatment of TB including genital tuberculosis.",

        "D": "It commonly presents as a unilateral condition"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Genital tuberculosis is a bilateral condition.It can be caused by both Mycobacterium tuberculosis (95% cases) and Mycobacterium bovis (5%cases). It almost always occurs secondary to a primary focus elsewhere in the body. The mostcommon primary focus is lungs &gt; lymph nodes &gt; abdomen &gt; generalised miliaryinfection.It mostly spreads hematogenously. Lymphatic spread is also seen sometimes. It can rarely spreadby direct contact with the affected intraabdominal organs or peritoneum.The fallopian tubes are the first to be affected. The disease subsequently spreads to other genitalorgans and the peritoneum. This is followed by the involvement of bilateral pelvic lymph nodes.Vulvovaginal involvement is usually secondary to uterine involvement.The most common presentation of genital tuberculosis in the reproductive age group is infertility.",

It canpresent as:• Infertility is the only complaint in 35-60 % of cases. Of these, 75% of women present withprimary infertility.• Menstrual abnormalities are seen in 10-40% of cases.• Asymptomatic in 10% of cases.755⚫ Other symptoms like fever and malaise can be seen.•The treatment of infertility in women with genital TB depends on the condition of theendometrium. If the endometrium is receptive and the uterus is normal, then assistedreproductive techniques such as in-vitro fertilisation can be tried. If the endometrium isunfavourable then surrogacy may be considered.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The fimbriae are often spared even in advanced forms of tubercular salpingitis.The involvement of fallopian tubes is 100% and bilateral, secondary to hematogenous spread. Theampullary part of the tube appears dilated with the fimbrial end open and pouting. This gives thecharacteristic tobacco-pouch appearance as seen in the image below.The external surface of the tubes are enlarged, roughened, and may show the presence of greyishtubercles. The cut section shows yellowish-grey caseous matter in the lumen. Sometimes,serosanguinous fluid can also be seen in the lumen of the fallopian tube. This is called tuberculoushematosalpinx.On histopathological examination of the tubes, granulomas and chronic inflammatory infiltratewith hyperplasia is seen. This could be mistaken for malignancy as it also produces a similarhistological image.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with abdominal pain, amenorrhoea, pelvic mass and ascites issuggestive of genital tuberculosis.Genital tuberculosis:756It is caused by M. tuberculosis and almost always occurs secondary to primary infection elsewherein the extragenital states. The sites and frequency of involvement are as follows:• Fallopian tubes (90-100%)• Endometrium (50-60%)• Ovaries (20-30%)•Cervix (5-15%)• Vulva and vagina (&lt; 1%)Presentation is variable and it can be asymptomatic in 10-20% of cases, infertility, menstrualirregularities, abdominal pain and mass, vaginal discharge, fistula formation, ectopic pregnancyand ascites. The mass is made up of rolled-up omentum that is adherent to the uterus and adnexa.Constitutional symptoms such as fever, weakness, anorexia or night sweats may be present.Investigations:• CBC, ESR and Mantoux test• Hysterosalpingography shows a lead-pipe appearance of the fallopian tube, calcification of thetube, beading and variation in the filling, cornual block, jagged fluffiness of tubal outline andtobacco pouch appearance of hydrosalpinx and pyosalpinx.• Laparoscopy establishes the diagnosis of genital TB.

Tuboplasty is contraindicated.Option B: Ovarian tumors usually don't affect menstrual cycles. Though virilizing tumors cancause amenorrhoea, other features of virilization such as hirsutism, flattening of breasts, andenlargement of the clitoris are generally present.757Option C: Though ectopic pregnancy may be suspected here, the tube is likely to rupture withexacerbation of pain, bleeding, and peritonitis before six months of gestation. Additionally, theabsence of vaginal bleeding/spotting, and the presence of weight loss makes the diagnosisunlikely.Option D: Submucous fibroid is associated with menorrhagia.First 2 monthsIsoniazid 15 mg/kg body weightRifampicin 450-600 mgPyrazinamide 30 mg/body weightEthambutol 30 mg/kg body weight3 times a week.Next 4 monthsIsoniazid 15 mg/kg body weightRifampicin 450-600 mg3 times a weekIndicationsUnresponsiveness of the disease in spite of adequate antitubercular chemotherapy.

      "explanation": "The Quantiferon test will be positive in patients having genital TB. It is an indicator of latenttuberculosis. The Quantiferon test measures the release of interferon-gamma by T cells followingstimulation by antigens unique to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.A differential WBC count shows lymphocytosis at all stages of genital tuberculosis. The ESR isfrequently raised and is a non-specific investigation at any stage of the disease. None of these testscan be used for confirmation as these markers are raised in many infections.The Mantoux test is positive in 90% of cases of genital TB. It is indicative of past exposure to thetubercle bacilli. It is not a confirmatory investigation but a negative result indicates tuberculosisto be unlikely.",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "A wedge-shaped defect is not suggestive of tubercular salpingitis. It is seen at the uterine isthmusin patients with a history of Cesarean section with a uterine scar.Hysterosalpingography (HSG) features of genital tuberculosis are:• Lead pipe appearance due to rigid nonperistaltic pipe-like tube758• Beading and variation in filling defect• Calcification of the tube•Jagged fluffiness of the tubal outline• Tobacco-pouch appearance of hydrosalpinx and pyosalpinx• Golf club appearance with slight or moderate dilatation of the ampullary portion of the fallopiantube.• Rosette type appearance secondary to multiple small diverticular like outpouching surroundingthe ampulla produced by caseous ulceration.HSG is contraindicated in genital tuberculosis as it causes dissemination of the infection. Thisfurther increases the damage to the fallopian tubes.The investigation of choice in genital tuberculosis is an endometrial biopsy. The tubercle bacilliare present in the deeper layers of the endometrium. They come to the surface just beforemenstruation. Hence, an endometrial biopsy is done 1 or 2 days before menstruation.Menstrual blood can also be used for detecting mycobacteria.An HSG showing the features of tuberculous salpingitis is given below.OMARROWL",

      "explanation": "The given image shows bilateral hydrosalpinx. It appears as a thin-walled structure.A hydrosalpinx is a chronic cystic swelling of the fallopian tube that forms after a distal tubalobstruction. The tubes are enormously distended due to filling with clear serous fluid andbecome retort-shaped. On histology, the tubal plicae appear flattened. The interstitial end of thetube is open whereas the fimbrial end is indrawn and closed. This permits the dye to enter but notexit the tube during HSG.It is caused due to:759• Pelvic inflammatory disease• Endometriosis•⚫ Tuberculosis - tubercular salpingitis may also cause tobacco-pouch appearance, lead pipeappearance and pyosalpinx•Fallopian tube neoplasms (rare)It can be an incidental finding during a pelvic exam or ultrasound. The patient maybe asymptomatic, or present with infertility or chronic pelvic pain.On HSG, it appears as terminal sacculation and occlusion of both fallopian tubes with a normaluterine cavity. Usually, a thin-walled, hypoechoic, cystic structure is seen. However, it may appearas multiple hyperechoic mural nodules around the inner circumference of the tube creating a'beads on a string' appearance.Treatment:• Treat the underlying cause•Laparoscopic salpingostomy - in mild disease• IVF recommended for women with infertility and severe hydrosalpinxOMARROWL760",
