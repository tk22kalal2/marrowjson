Prior to performingthe procedure, several measures can be taken to alleviate cord compression. These measuresinvolve:• Manually elevating the fetal presenting part using two fingers or the entire hand through thevagina215•Positioning the patient in steep Trendelenburg, exaggerated Sim's position, or knee-chestposition•Filling the bladder with 500-700 cc or more of saline (known as the Vagos method)After the diagnosis of cord prolapse is made, it is crucial not to attempt cord replacement.

      "explanation": "Bandl's ring refers to pathological retraction ring. It is formed in cases of obstructed labour.The upper segment of the uterus contracts and retracts vigourously in an attempt to overcome theobstruction while the lower segment dilates.With each contraction there is myometrial shortening so that the actively contracting uppersegment becomes progressively thicker and shorter. The passive lower segment is progressivelystretched and becomes thinner.The junction between the two segments stands out prominently as a pathological retraction ring.216Schroeder's constriction ring is formed due to incordinate uterine action when there is localizedspastic contraction of a ring of circular muscle fibres of the uterus. It is formed due to injudicioususe of oxytocin and premature rupture of membranes (PROM).",
