      "explanation": "The given T2 MRI image shows the racing car appearance, which is seen in agenesis of the corpuscallosum. This sign refers to the widely spaced lateral ventricles with intervening Probstbundles (white matter tracts that are no longer able to cross the midline in the corpus callosum).Appearances on axial MRI or CT resemble a Formula One car seen from above. The front tyres arerepresented by the widely spaced frontal horns anteriorly. The back tyres are represented by thedilated trigones seen posteriorly, which is also known as colpocephaly.The image given below shows the racing car sign in corpus callosal agensis.MRI of Corpus Agenesis - Racing car signOther options:Option B: Marchiafava - Bignami disease is a rare condition characterized by demyelination of thecorpus callosum most often in patients with chronic alcoholism. The MRI image in this conditionshows the sandwich sign.370Apr 13 205:32:22Option C: Metachromatic leukodystrophy is an autosomal-recessive disease that results from adeficiency of the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A. Symmetric confluent areas of T2hyperintensity are seen in the periventricular white matter. Radiating T2 hypointense linesthrough the demyelinated deep white matter represent the sparing of the perivascular whitematter. This results in the tigroid and leopard skin patterns when imaged in the long axis orcross-section, respectively. Subcortical U-fibers are spared.Option D: The most common site of lipoma in the brain is the peri-callosal region. The CT belowshows bracket calcification of lipoma and is called bracket sign.371",

      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Frog-eye sign in the ultrasound is suggestive of Anencephaly.Anencephaly is an open defect in the calvaria and skin that results from incomplete closure of theneural tube. It is one of the earliest detectable congenital defects that can be detected as early as10 to 11 weeks of gestation. Screening for anencephaly reveals increased levels of maternal serumalpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP). Diagnosis is confirmed by sonography. The following are theradiological signs seen in anencephaly:• Frog eye sign - Absence of cranial calvaria, causing prominent orbits, thereby resembling theface of a frog.• Shower cap sign - The absence of the cranium could lead to the protrusion of a disorganizedmass of brain tissue. This resembles a shower cap, giving rise to a characteristic triangular facialappearance.The images given below show open calvaria on antenatal ultrasound and a 'shower cap' sign.372Shower cap sign1.

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The pelvic ultrasound in a 35-year-old woman shows the 'T-sign' seen in a monochorionic twinpregnancy.In monochorionic pregnancy, the chorion does not extend between the layers of the intertwinmembrane. Thus, the inter-twin membrane comes to an abrupt halt in a T-configuration at theedge of the amniotic sac.In contrast, in a dichorionic pregnancy, the sonographic image depicts a 'twin-peak' sign or the'lambda sign\" as the chorion is present between the intertwin membrane. A triangular portion ofthe placenta is seen inserted between the amniochorion layers.The type of twin pregnancy is best diagnosed by transabdominal ultrasound at 11-14 weeks ofgestation as the chorion and amnion are not yet fused. At 11-14 weeks, the intervening membranesare clearly visualized at the site of insertion of the amniotic membrane into the placenta. If notvisualised transabdominally, transvaginal ultrasound is done.Sonographic assessment is done by observing the following:Monochorionic DichorionicityPlacental massPresence of intervening membraneThickness of intervening membraneity12T signtwin peak/lambda/ delta sign<2mm> 2mm374USG findings in Twin PregnancyNARROWAmnionChorionMonochorionic diamniotic twins - T signMARROWDichorionic diamniotic twins - Twin peak signMARROW",

The bladder should be empty andnot full, for transvaginal USG (TVS) to allow visualisation of other structures.A condom is placed on the transducer before the TVS transducer is inserted into the vagina.

It consists ofthe decidua parietalis (lining the uterine cavity) and decidua capsularis (lining the gestational sac)and is seen as two concentric rings surrounding an anechoic gestational sac.The double decidual sac sign differentiates normal pregnancy from the pseudo-gestational sac ofan ectopic pregnancy.

The given image shows bilateralretort-shaped fallopian tubes, indicating bilateral hydrosalpinx.Hysterosalpingography (HSG) is a technique used for visualization of the uterine cavity andfallopian tubes by the injection of a radioopaque dye, and visualization of the dye by fluoroscopyas it passes through the uterine cavity and fallopian tubes.It is best performed between the end of the menstrual period and ovulation (i.e. 9th or 10th day ofthe cycle). 10-15ml of the dye is injected using a Leech-Wilkinson cannula, Rubin's cannula, orFoley's catheter. If the tubes are patent, the dye will spill out of the tubal Ostia and smear the376adjacent bowel.It is used to detect:•⚫ Tubal block: This can be due to strictures (fibrotic block), inspissated amorphous material, orspasms.

As gestation increases,there is a gradual fall in all the resistance indices, so the amount of forward diastolic flowincreases. S/D ratio decreases as the period of gestation increases (S represents the peak systolicflow or velocity, and D indicates the end-diastolic flow or velocity).Abnormal flow patterns in the umbilical artery:• Reduced end-diastolic flow: Uteroplacental insufficiency..• Absent end-diastolic flow: Fetal compromise (terminate the pregnancy by cesarean section ifgestational age is &gt;34 weeks).• Reverse end-diastolic flow: Impending doom of death (terminate pregnancy irrespective ofgestational age).Patterns of end-diastolic flowin the umbilical arteryNormal diastolic flowAbsence of end-diastolic flowReversal of end-diastolic flowMiddle cerebral artery: This will show increased diastolic velocity in fetus with hypoxemia.",

      "explanation": "The given image shows the lemon sign, which is seen in spina bifida.Spina bifida is the common open neural tube defect associated with hydrocephalus andArnold-Chiari II malformation. It is the most common open neural tube disorder. Spina bifida ischaracterized by a cleft in the vertebral column with a corresponding defect in the skin so that themeninges and spinal cord are exposed.378The 3 main types of spina bifida:•Spina bifida occulta - This is the mildest form of spina bifida. The defect in the vertebral archesis covered by the skin. The splits in the vertebrae are so small that the spinal cord does notprotrude. The skin at the site of the lesion may be normal, or it may have some hair growing fromit.•Meningocele - The defect in the vertebra allows the meninges to protrude through the defect.Myelomeningocele (meningomyelocele) - A defect in the vertebral column allows the spinal cordwith the meningeal coverings to protrude.Spina bifida occultaMeningoceleMyelomeningoceleThe lemon sign is related to changes in the configuration of the fetal frontal bone, which losesconvexity and appears concave or linear on ultrasonography; this sign can be detected during thefirst six months of gestation.The banana sign is another sign that is seen in spina bifida associated with Arnold-Chiari IImalformation. Herniation of the brainstem and cerebellar tonsils occurs through the foramenmagnum, with the cerebellum surrounding the brainstem, thus giving rise to the appearance ofthe curved shape of a banana.Other options:Option B: Anencephaly is characterized by an open defect in the calvaria and skin, such that thecranial neural tube is exposed. It is a severe defect and is not compatible with survival. Frog eyesign is seen in USG. Prominent orbits (arrows) and an absence of cerebral tissue more craniallyare seen.Option C: Holoprosencephaly is a rare congenital brain malformation resulting from incompleteseparation of the two hemispheres. On antenatal ultrasound, there may be also evidence ofpolyhydramnios, and the snake-under-the-skull sign may also be seen.Option D: Omphalocele is a midline anterior abdominal wall defect through which the solidabdominal viscera and/or bowel may herniate. The extruded abdominal contents are covered in asac. Given below is a fetal ultrasound image suggestive of an omphalocele (asterisk).379380",
