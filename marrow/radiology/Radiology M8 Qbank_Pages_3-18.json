      "explanation": "An X-ray film is coated with a photosensitive emulsion on both sides, most commonly silver bromide. Apart from silver bromide, silver iodide is also used. In routine films, both sides are coated, whereas in mammography, only one side of the film is coated. Note: X-ray films are most sensitive to blue light and least sensitive to red light. So, the safe light used in the darkroom is a red light.",

      "question": "How are X-rays produced?",
      "options": {
        "A": "When an electron beam strikes the nucleus of the atom in the anode",
        "B": "When an electron beam decelerates close to the nucleus of the atom in the anode",

        "D": "When an electron beam strikes the cathode"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "X-rays are produced when the electron beam decelerates close to the nucleus of the atom in the anode. The production of X-rays is as follows. Current is passed through a tungsten filament, which acts as the cathode. Electrons are emitted as a result of thermionic emission. Electrons bombard the target anode, a tungsten disc. This results in the conversion of energy into heat (99%) and X-ray photons (1%). The target anode is made of a tungsten disc in ordinary diagnostic X-ray tubes and molybdenum in mammography X-ray tubes. At the anode, fast-moving electrons interact with the atoms of the anode in one of the following ways: nucleus field interaction, also known as continuous spectrum radiation or Bremsstrahlung reaction (80%); and inner shell interaction, which produces characteristic spectrum radiation (20%). Anode X-ray equipment: X-ray beam. Important parameters with respect to X-rays include: kilovolt peak (kVp) - the potential difference between the cathode and anode. When the voltage increases, energy increases, and penetration also increases. Hence, more kVp is required for obese patients. Milliampere second (mAs) - determines the amount of film blackening. More mAs means more radiation exposure. Contrast is influenced by both kVp and mAs. kVp is inversely proportional, whereas mAs is directly proportional to the contrast produced.",

      "question": "The photoelectric effect can be best described as an interaction between:",
      "options": {
        "A": "High energy incident photon and the inner shell electron",
        "B": "Low energy incident photon and the outer shell electron",
        "C": "High energy incident photon and the outer shell electron",
        "D": "Low energy incident photon and the inner shell electron"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The photoelectric effect is an interaction between a low to intermediate energy X-ray beam and the inner shell electron. When the inner shell electron is ejected, the outer electron goes into the inner orbit to occupy the space, and the extra energy is ejected as characteristic radiation, and is called the photoelectric effect. The photoelectric effect is fundamentally important in diagnostic radiography since it is the primary method by which contrast is developed in radiographs. It allows for the differentiation of different types of tissues on the X-ray film. The photoelectric effect involves an inner shell electron, an outer shell electron, a bombarding electron that strikes the inner shell electron, and a photoelectron. A 'hole' is created in the inner shell when the bombarding electron is diverted and the electron that was hit is ejected as a photoelectron and absorbed. The outer shell electron moves down to fill the 'hole' in the inner shell, and energy from this movement is released as a characteristic energy photon. Very low-energy X-rays are not capable of producing the photoelectric effect. High energy X-rays are also not capable of the photoelectric effect due to random scattering of electrons from the outer shell, known as the Compton effect, which can lead to distortion of the image. The goal of X-ray imaging should be to minimize the Compton effect and maximize the photoelectric effect. The penetrating power of X-rays increases with increasing energy, which is directly proportional to the frequency and inversely proportional to the wavelength.",

Contrast containing iodine is used in CT, IVP, and angiography. Since all these imaging modalities are based on X-rays, iodine is used as it is radio-opaque. In contrast medium, iodine provides radio-opacity and the other elements act as carriers of iodine. These carriers increase the solubility and decrease the toxicity of iodine.",

      "explanation": "Spiral CT is based on the technology called a slip ring. It is a device that distributes the power supply between the patient table (or couch) and the gantry, which contains the spinning X-ray tube. The slip ring makes the simultaneous movement of the patient and X-ray tube rotation possible. The process of CT imaging is faster, and the entire trunk can be taken in a single breath-hold. Thus, there is no respiratory misregistration. Also, in spiral CT, 3D reconstruction can be done. A spiral CT is the investigation of choice for renal stones. It is also used for staging of colon cancer and for visualization of pulmonary embolism. Radiation exposure: • CT abdomen = 500 chest X-rays (highest) • CT head = 100 to 150 chest X-rays • Mammography = 20 to 25 chest X-rays.",

      "explanation": "A cardiac CT is done in mid-diastole assisted by synchronous ECG gating. The least cardiac motion occurs during diastole when the ventricles are passively filling. Prospective ECG triggering uses the ECG signal to control scanning so that X-rays are generated and projection data are acquired only during cardiac diastole. Cardiac CT is done in CAD and for coronary calcium scoring. Coronary calcium scoring denotes the degree of atherosclerosis and determines prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease. It is an example of multi-slice CT or multidetector CT (MDCT). In MDCT, multiple sections can be taken in one rotation. Spiral CT takes only one section in one rotation.",
