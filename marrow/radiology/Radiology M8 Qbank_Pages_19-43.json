      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The USG image represents the M-mode used for echocardiography. Echo intensity is represented as brightness and a trace is swept across the screen so that the x-axis represents time. Ultrasonography is a versatile imaging modality known for its portability and safety, particularly as it does not involve radiation exposure. As the safest radiological investigation for pregnancy, it provides crucial information without posing any risks to the mother or fetus, making it indispensable in obstetric care. Different modes in USG and its uses are as follows: \n      • A (amplitude) mode: Used in ophthalmology and orbital biometry (option A).\n      • B (brightness) mode: Used for all routine applications, with brightness encoded as grayscale value (option B).\n      • M (motion) mode: In echocardiography.\n      HIFU (high-intensity focused USG) is a therapeutic application of USG. It is useful for the treatment of fibroids. HIFU exploits the thermal effects of high-powered, tightly focused ultrasound beams so that very small target tissues can be heated and coagulated.\n      The image below depicts a duplex scan, which is a combination of B-mode imaging and pulsed Doppler data acquisition.\n      Doppler ultrasound (option D) is used in diagnosing peripheral arterial disease. It uses a handheld Doppler ultrasound probe placed at an arterial site. A normal arterial wave has a triphasic signal. A triphasic wave has three waveforms consisting of a sharp systolic wave with a forward uprise and fall, a second wave with reverse flow occurring in diastole, and the last wave with a forward flow taking place during diastole.\n      Doppler ultrasound can detect moving blood. However, it does not provide information on whether the blood flow is sufficient for the maintenance of limb viability.",

      "explanation": "The above clinical scenario is suggesting the likelihood of breast abscess and Ultrasonography (USG) is the investigation of choice in this condition. This investigation can differentiate between solid and cystic lesions of the breast and is able to detect abnormal axillary lymph nodes. USG is preferred in pregnant, lactating, and young women (less than 40 years) since breast tissue is dense in these populations. Mammography is indicated in women over the age of 40 with breast symptoms and signs, including screening of breast lump and prolonged puerperal abscesses.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Doppler effect results from an apparent shift in sound frequency as sound waves are reflected from moving targets, usually blood cells. In color Doppler, the type of color represents the direction of flow. \n   • Red - flow is towards the transducer\n   • Blue - flow is away from the transducer\n   Uses of Doppler: \n   • Investigation of choice in DVT\n   • Investigation of choice in testicular and ovarian torsion\n   • Carotid artery stenosis screening - if there is stenosis, velocity is increased\n   • In pregnancy: \n   • Umbilical artery Doppler for follow-up of fetal IUGR\n   • Uterine artery Doppler - diastolic notch usually disappears after 22 weeks. Persistent diastolic notch in the uterine artery after 22 weeks of gestation is a predictor of pre-eclampsia\n   • Increased peak systolic velocity of fetal MCA is an indicator of fetal anemia.\n   In spectral Doppler, flow is represented in a waveform.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The Doppler waveform of the venous blood flow in lower limb DVT is monophasic proximal to the level of obstruction. The normal venous waveform shows a variation (phasicity) secondary to respiration referred to as a respirophasic waveform. Loss of this phasic variation results in a monophasic waveform suggestive of venous obstruction proximal to the level of interrogation. A normal artery has a triphasic signal. The waveform becomes biphasic in mild-moderate stenosis and monophasic in severe stenosis. The image given below shows the normal triphasic signal from an artery.

Clinical imaging scanners have magnets with field strengths ranging from 0.2 to 3 Tesla (and more recently 7 Tesla). Routinely used MRI has a field strength of 1.5 Tesla, which is created by superconductors. The Hounsfield scale/unit (HU) is used to measure the X-ray attenuation values in CT scanning.",

      "explanation": "The given MRI is a T2 weighted image as the CSF appears bright/hyperintense and white matter appears dark. Many pulse sequence techniques are used in MRI, and the most classic are T1 and T2 weighted images. T2 weighted image: T2 weighted MRI. Other options: Option A: In T1 weighted images, CSF is dark/hypointense, white matter is white, and grey matter is dark. T1 weighted image: T1 weighted MRI. Option C: FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) is an inversion recovery technique that nulls fluid from T2. As a result, CSF is dark. However, white matter is dark and grey matter is bright, similar to T2 imaging. FLAIR image: FLAIR MRI. Option D: STIR (short tau inversion recovery) is an inversion recovery technique that nulls fat from T2. So, fat is dark. It is done to detect bone marrow edema in body part scans. Signals from fat nulled: STIR MRI.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The contrast agent used for MRI is gadolinium. It acts by reducing both T1 and T2 relaxation time of the tissue. The predominant effect is on T1, so post-contrast is a T1 weighted image. Since gadolinium ion is toxic, Gd-DTPA (Gadolinium diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid) is used. Contraindications: • Renal failure - Gd-DTPA is predominantly excreted through the kidney. Hence, in renal failure, it gets accumulated in the body and releases gadolinium ions. Since the ion is toxic, the body tries to contain it by fibrosis resulting in multisystem painful fibrosis called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. As a result, gadolinium-containing contrast is contraindicated in patients with an estimated GFR under 60 ml/min and especially under 30 ml/min. • Pregnancy - Due to the risk of teratogenicity. Gadolinium does not cross the blood-brain barrier unless the barrier is disrupted. Optison and Levovist are ultrasound contrast agents. Ultrasound contrast agents are gas-filled microbubbles that are administered intravenously to the systemic circulation.",

A Faraday cage is a conductive box used to shield out stray electromagnetic interference. It is most commonly made of wood panels wrapped with copper. Other metals, like aluminum and galvanized steel, can also be used. It serves two functions: to prevent external radiofrequency pulses from interfering with the detector, and to prevent radiofrequency pulses generated by the scanner from interfering with the external environment.",
