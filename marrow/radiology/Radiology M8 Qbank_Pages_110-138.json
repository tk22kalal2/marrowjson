      "explanation": "This is a chest X-ray showing a bulging fissure sign. It is seen in Klebsiella pneumonia, tuberculosis, and carcinoma bronchus. A bulging fissure sign is seen in: • Klebsiella pneumonia (most common) • Legionella pneumonia • Streptococcal pneumonia • Tuberculosis • Yersinia pestis • Lung abscesses • Carcinoma bronchus. It is seen due to the volume increase of the infected lobe or space-occupying lesions, displacing or bulging adjacent fissures of the affected lung. Features of pulmonary edema include Kerley lines, thickened interlobar fissures, and transient loculated fluid collection in pleural or interlobar fissures, known as vanishing pulmonary pseudotumor. This condition is typically seen in congestive heart failure and reflects a generalized fluid overload state that resolves with diuretics.",

They may contain air-fluid levels. Causes of pneumatocele formation: • Staphylococcus aureus (most common) • Klebsiella • Kerosene poisoning • Lung injury (most commonly ventilator-induced) • Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia.

If there is a disruption of the inner layers, it results in a cavitary lesion with one or more of the following radiographic features: • Air-fluid level • Water lily sign/camalote sign - air-fluid level with a floating membrane • Double wall • Rising sun sign/serpent sign - a double-wall, dry cyst with crumpled membranes lying at its bottom • Empty cyst sign - when all the contents are removed. Hydatid cysts result from infection by the Echinococcus species and can result in cyst formation anywhere in the body. Echinococcus granulosus species is the most common.",

      "explanation": "Galaxy sign is a radiologic feature observed on HRCT in sarcoidosis, not on chest X-ray. It represents a coalescing granuloma with numerous smaller granulomas. Depending on the stage of sarcoidosis, radiological features can range from a normal chest radiograph to pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary sarcoidosis can be classified on a chest radiograph into 5 stages. A normal chest radiograph indicates stage 0. Other stages are: nodal enlargement only, nodal enlargement and parenchymal disease, parenchymal disease only, and fibrosis.",

This occurs because of the symmetrical uptake of Gallium-67 in the nasopharynx, lacrimal glands, and parotid glands, reflecting the bilateral involvement of the glands in sarcoidosis. Other signs seen in sarcoidosis are: \n   • The lambda sign refers to bilateral hilar and right paratracheal lymphadenopathy (seen on FDG PET Scan/ Ga scintigraphy).\n   • Garland triad or 1-2-3 sign or Pawnbroker's sign is a lymph node enlargement pattern that is seen in sarcoidosis (seen on chest X-ray).\n   • Galaxy sign (sarcoid galaxy) represents a coalescent granuloma seen in a minority of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, seen on HRCT.",

        "D": "Bronchiectasis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The marked finding is known as the Monod sign, which is seen in aspergilloma. It refers to the presence of gas surrounding a fungal mass within a pulmonary cavity. Aspergillomas (non-invasive pulmonary aspergillosis): Aspergillus fumigatus can cause mass-like fungus ball formation in structurally abnormal lungs (pre-existing cavities like in pulmonary tuberculosis). On plain film and CT, an intracavitary mass surrounded by a crescent of air (Monod sign), is typically observed. Angioinvasive aspergillosis occurs primarily in immunocompromised patients. On HRCT, it is characterized by ground-glass opacity surrounding a pulmonary nodule or mass called a halo sign. This sign indicates a hemorrhage. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an immune reaction. The image depicts a gloved finger appearance of ABPA in the left upper lobe. It is a characteristic sign of bronchocele. Other options: Option A: Blastomycosis is a chronic infection, characterized by the formation of suppurative and granulomatous lesions, especially in the lungs and skin. The pulmonary disease resembles TB or histoplasmosis. There can be focal or diffuse consolidation, miliary lesions, or abscess formation. Option B: A patient presenting with fever, breathlessness, and cough with expectoration is most likely suffering from pneumonia. The CT image shows a sharply demarcated homogenous consolidation that crosses segmental boundaries and involves only a single lobe, suggestive of lobar pneumonia. Option D: Bronchiectasis is characterized by local and irreversible dilatation of bronchi. Radiographic findings are tramline appearance (seen on chest X-rays) and ring or curvilinear opacities on end-on appearance. CT shows bronchial dilatation and lack of tapering of the bronchial lumen (cardinal sign) and signet-ring sign (internal diameter of the bronchi is greater than the adjacent pulmonary artery).",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The chest X-ray shown here demonstrates the Luftsichel sign, which translates from German as 'air crescent'. It is typically seen in the left upper lobe collapse, resulting in paramediastinal translucency. It occurs due to hyperinflation of the superior segment of the left lower lobe, creating a crescent of air between the aortic arch and the medial border of the collapsed left upper lobe. The CT below shows the collapse of the left upper lobe.",

      "explanation": "Plain CT is the standard investigation of choice for a solitary pulmonary nodule. A solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) is defined as a relatively well-defined, round or oval, pulmonary parenchymal lesion that is equal to or smaller than 30 mm in diameter. It is surrounded by pulmonary parenchyma and/or visceral pleura and is not associated with lymphadenopathy, atelectasis, or pneumonia. Features favouring malignancy in an SPN include: spiculated margin, lobulated margin, umbilication, cavitation, fine peripheral calcification, and doubling its volume in 1 to 6 months. The gold standard investigation is CT-guided biopsy. A PET scan is helpful in detecting malignancy in patients with inconclusive high-resolution CT findings.",

      "explanation": "In the above clinical scenario, the CT chest shows the comet-tail sign. It is seen in cases of round atelectasis. Round atelectasis is a form of parenchymal collapse condition characterised by the infolding of redundant pleura, resulting in a parenchymal collapse that can mimic a mass on imaging. The comet-tail sign is produced by the distortion of bronchovascular bundles that appear pulled into the collapsed area, resembling a comet tail. The most common cause of rounded atelectasis is occupational exposure to mineral dust: asbestos, pneumoconiosis, and mixed mineral dust.",
