      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "PET scans are based on the principle of production of a dual photon peak at 511 keV.To perform a PET scan, a radionuclide tracer (labeled to FDG molecules) is used. These moleculesdecay in the body with the release of a positron. The positron travels a short distance andannihilates with an anti-particle (electron). This annihilation reaction results in the formation oftwo high-energy photons that travel in opposite directions. Each photon has an energy of 511 keV,making this a dual photon peak at 511 keV.404",

      "explanation": "PET involves the use of a radiolabelled bio-compound such as 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)which is injected intravenously. This compound is taken up and broken down in the cells.It is based on the principle that tumour cells have a high metabolic rate, and hence this compoundis also metabolised by tumour cells. FDG is metabolised to FDG-6-phosphate which cannot befurther metabolized by tumour cells. Hence it accumulates in tumour cells and can be measuredand quantified.The applications of PET include:• Oncologic:•Detection, staging, drug response• Differentiation between radiation necrosis and recurrence• Neurologic:•Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease• Localisation of seizure focus in the interictal phase•Localising eloquent areas (e.g. speech, motor function)• Cardiac: Identification of hibernating myocardium",
