      "explanation": "A patient with the given history and barium swallow findings of irregular narrowing, mucosaldestruction, and shouldered margins of esophagus, are suggestive of carcinoma esophagus.Esophageal carcinoma is more common in men, with tobacco use and alcohol being the strongestrisk factors. The squamous cell carcinoma variant usually affects the upper 2/3rd, and theadenocarcinoma variant usually affects the lower 1/3rd of the esophagus. Clinical features includeprogressive dysphagia (most common), regurgitation of food, vomiting, odynophagia and weightloss.On barium swallow, carcinoma esophagus presents with irregular narrowing and ulceration ofesophagus. Flexible endoscopy with biopsy is preferred for confirmation ofdiagnosis. Contrast-enhanced CT and PET can be used to assess distant metastasis. Endoscopicultrasonography (EUS) is the investigation of choice to assess tumor invasion and lymph nodemetastasis.Other options:Option B: Diffuse esophageal spasm results in the corkscrew appearance of the esophagus onbarium study.Option C: Esophageal leiomyoma appears as a smooth, semilunar filling defect on bariumswallow. it is seen as a discrete ovoid mass that is well outlined by barium.Option D: Esophageal webs occur in the upper and middle esophagus as a thin membrane thatcan be identified by the translucent part on contrast radiology.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario along with the barium swallow showing esophageal web is suggestiveof Plummer-Vinson syndrome.Plummer-Vinson syndrome is also known as Paterson-Brown-Kelly syndrome. It commonlyaffects middle-aged women with long-standing anaemia, and is a recognized risk factor forpost-cricoid hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. It consists of dysphagia, iron-deficiencyanemia and esophageal webs or hypopharyngeal webs.Esophageal webs are due to a constriction caused by a thin mucosal membrane projecting into thelumen. More commonly, they are seen in the cervical esophagus near the cricopharyngeus muscle.They typically arise from the anterior wall, but never from the posterior wall. They may also becircumferential.The image below depicts a barium swallow showing an upper esophageal concentric web in alateral view.247",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The mucosal ring at the squamocolumnar junction of the distal esophagus is a B-ring.Distal esophageal rings are frequent findings on barium contrast X-ray studies. They are of twotypes:• B-ring - It occurs at the squamocolumnar junction or gastroesophageal junction. It is lined withsquamous epithelium above and columnar epithelium below.• A-ring - It occurs above the B-ring, i.e., a few centimetres proximal to the gastroesophagealjunction. It represents a physiological contraction of esophageal smooth muscle covered bymucosa. A-rings are usually asymptomatic (option B).Schatzki ring, also called Schatzki-Gary ring, is a symptomatic narrow B-ring occurring in thedistal esophagus. It is usually associated with a hiatus hernia.Esophageal RingsMASchatzki ring(narrowed B ring)A ring(muscular ring)B ring(mucosal ring)OMARROW249The below image is a barium study showing the Schatzki ring located at the gastroesophagealjunction, suggestive of hiatus hernia.Other options:Option C: Esophageal webs are most common in the upper oesophagus (post-cricoid area), wherethey are generally semi-circumferential, eccentric lesions that protrude less than 5 mm and have athickness of 2 to 4 mm. Microscopically, webs are composed of fibrovascular connective tissueand overlying epithelium.The barium swallow below shows the oesophagal web in a patient with Plummer-Vinsonsyndrome. Oesophagal webs are thin membranes of normal oesophagal tissue consisting ofmucosa and submucosa. The translucent part denotes the oesophagal web.Option D: Esophageal stricture refers to any persistent intrinsic narrowing of the esophagus. Thecauses are peptic stricture (esophagitis induced), corrosives (most common cause), foreign body,250post-surgical, radiotherapy, congenital, tuberculosis, and drugs like tetracycline.Radiographic features of benign strictures show smooth tapering with typical concentricnarrowing (may affect only one side of the esophagus) while malignant strictures arecharacteristically abrupt, asymmetric, and eccentric with irregular nodular mucosa. The bariumstudy image below shows esophageal stricture.",

      "explanation": "The given upper GI series shows the collection of contrast in a posterior pharyngeal pouch-likestructure, which favors the diagnosis of Zenker's diverticulum.A barium swallow study may show a diverticulum arising from the midline of the posterior wall ofthe distal pharynx near the pharyngoesophageal junction. The diverticulum is typically noted atthe C5-6 level. The outpouching may be transient, sometimes referred to as a pharyngeal pouch.The pouch is best identified during swallowing and is best visualized on the lateral view.Since a majority of patients with a Zenker's diverticulum have a hiatal hernia andgastro-oesophageal reflux, the distal esophagus should also be evaluated.Note: Killian-Jamieson diverticulum is an outpouching from the lateral wall of the proximalcervical esophagus.",

These folds are 1-2 mm thick and runhorizontally around the entire circumference of the esophageal lumen. It is thought to be due tothe contraction of the muscularis mucosae of the esophagus. This results in the shortening of the251esophagus and the bunching up of the mucosa in the lumen.The appearance is almost always associated with active gastroesophageal reflux. The findings aretransient, seen following reflux and not during swallowing. The appearance is confined to thedistal two-thirds of the thoracic esophagus.It can also be seen in hiatus hernia and eosinophilic esophagitis.

      "explanation": "The depth of the gastric carcinoma is assessed by endoluminal ultrasound.In endoluminal ultrasonography, the transducer is usually attached to the tip of the instrumentdistally, and five layers of the gastric wall may be identified, helping in assessing the depth ofinvasion (T component of the staging) of cancer with more than 90% accuracy.256Pre-operative staging is done with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of theabdominal/pelvis. The most important prognostic indicators in gastric cancer are - lymph nodeinvolvement and depth of tumor invasion. Endoluminal ultrasound and laparoscopic ultrasoundare the most sensitive methods in pre-operative local staging of gastric cancer.Other options:Option A: Standard abdominal ultrasound can be used to investigate the stomach, but it is lesssensitive than other modalities in gastric cancer.Option B: Barium meal radiology is now used less frequently due to advances in more sensitivediagnostic tools like endoscopy and CT imaging with oral contrast, replacing contrast radiology ininvestigating gastric malignancies. However, CT remains less accurate in the T-staging of gastriccancer compared to endoluminal ultrasound.Option D: Laparoscopy is routine in the assessment of gastric cancer. However, the mainlimitation is in the evaluation of posterior extension, where CT and endoluminal ultrasound canprovide this information.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given chest X-ray image depicts Chilaiditi sign, characterized by the anterior interposition ofthe colon between the liver and the right hemidiaphragm, which can mimic air under thediaphragm, leading to pseudo-pneumoperitoneum.Chilaiditi sign is typically an incidental finding on imaging and is most often asymptomatic.However, when associated with symptoms such as abdominal pain and distension, it is referred toas Chilaiditi syndrome.An erect X-ray showing this sign may mislead clinicians into suspecting pneumoperitoneum,prompting unnecessary urgent surgical intervention, which is not required. To differentiateChilaiditi syndrome from true pneumoperitoneum, a contrast-enhanced CT or a left lateraldecubitus radiograph can be performed. In the left lateral decubitus view, distended colonic loopswith haustral markings will be visible, showing that the air is within the bowel and not in theperitoneal cavity.Other conditions with the Chilaiditi sign are curvilinear pulmonary collapse, distended viscus,omental fat, and apposition of gas-distended bowel loops mimicking the double-wall sign.262Below is the chest X-ray and CT showing the presence of herniated bowel loops under thediaphragm.P-AOther options:Option A: The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis shows free intraperitoneal gas which issuggestive of pneumoperitoneum. The presence of free intra-abdominal gas almost alwaysindicates perforation of a hollow viscus. Free intraperitoneal gas is also detectable under thehemidiaphragm on an erect chest X-ray as given below.263Hollow viscus perforationGas undercliaphragmGas underdiaphragmOption B: The existence of extraluminal gas within the mediastinum is referred to aspneumomediastinum. Gas may originate from the peritoneal cavity, lungs, trachea, centralbronchi, oesophagus, or peritoneal cavity and travel to the neck or abdomen via the mediastinum.Spinnaker sign (also called angel wing sign) is a radiographic sign seen in neonates withpneumomediastinum. The pressure from the collected gas displaces the two lobes of the thymictissue upward and laterally from its normal position. This results in large, wedge-shaped opacitieson radiograph resembling the spinnaker headsails of a boat. Other signs of pneumomediastinumare the V sign of Naclerio and continuous diaphragm sign.Below is a chest X-ray showing spinnaker sign and CT showing the presence ofpneumomediastinum.264Spinnaker sail sign",

      "explanation": "Among the given options, the left lateral decubitus X-ray of the abdomen is the best view tovisualize the pneumoperitoneum.As little as 1 mL of free gas can be detected on a plain radiograph. Hence the best views tovisualize pneumoperitoneum:• Erect chest X-ray - the first, most important and useful view showing air beneath thediaphragm.• Left lateral decubitus abdominal imageCT abdomen is the most sensitive imaging technique to detect minimal pneumoperitoneum.265",
