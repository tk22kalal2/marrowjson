Radiological features of osteogenesis imperfecta include: multiple diaphyseal fractures of long bones with various stages can be seen. A radiograph of the skull shows wormian bones or intrasutural bone ossicles. As battered baby syndrome can present with multiple fractures secondary to abuse, it is a common differential diagnosis for osteogenesis imperfecta.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In greenstick fractures, the inner cortex (concave) bends and the outer (convex) cortex breaks. A greenstick fracture is a partial thickness fracture where only the cortex and periosteum are interrupted on one side of the bone, while they remain uninterrupted on the other side. In children, the bones are more resilient and hence, greenstick fractures are more common. It is commonly seen in the shaft of forearm bones. Note: In a torus fracture, compression on one side causes the other side to be buckled. Distinct fracture lines are not seen and both cortices are intact.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario, along with the light bulb sign in the X-ray, is suggestive of a posterior dislocation of the shoulder. It occurs most commonly during a convulsion, or after an electric shock. It can also happen after a fall on the flexed, adducted arm, either by a direct blow to the front of the shoulder or due to a fall on the outstretched hand. There is internal rotation of the humeral head, which causes changes to the normal radiographic contour of the head of the humerus. Radiological signs described in posterior dislocation of the shoulder in the AP view are as follows: • Light bulb sign - Shape of humeral head appears like that of an electric bulb; • Rim sign - Widening of the glenohumeral joint space > 6 mm; • Vacant glenoid sign - Glenoid fossa looks empty as the humeral head has moved away from it; • Trough sign - Vertical line seen on the anteromedial part of the humeral head due to the impression fracture by the glenoid labrum. Posterior dislocation of the shoulder: Light bulb sign.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario describes a patient who developed pain in his shoulder after forced abduction of his shoulder after a fall. The x-ray shows the head of the humerus is below the glenoid and the shaft in the abducted position. This is suggestive of an inferior shoulder dislocation, also known as luxatio erecta. It is rare and occurs when the arm is forcefully pulled up when in full abduction (hyper-abduction force) due to high-energy trauma. The patient will present with the arm locked in almost full abduction.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "This patient's presentation after a fall on the outstretched arm and the X-ray is suggestive of a supracondylar fracture of the humerus. A displaced fracture can damage the median nerve, causing a pointing index sign. A common complication is cubitus varus deformity (gunstock deformity) due to the malunion of fractured ends. Myositis ossificans is a delayed complication of the fracture.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The given features and radiograph are suggestive of volar or reverse Barton's fracture. Volar-type/reverse Barton's is a fracture-dislocation of the volar rim of the radius. This type is the most common. Dislocation of the radiocarpal joint is the hallmark of Barton's fracture. The radiographic findings are the following: • Comminuted intraarticular fracture of the distal radius • Volar rim maintains a relationship with the carpus and both are displaced proximally • Fracture of the radial styloid process with loss of radial inclination. Reverse-type Barton's fracture is similar to Smith's fracture, but the difference is that the fracture line runs obliquely and extends into the joint surface. Another type is dorsal Barton's fracture, which results due to fracture-dislocation of the dorsal rim of the radius.",

Ewing's sarcoma is a malignant tumor that occurs more frequently in males, typically between 10 and 20 years of age, and has a diaphyseal long-bone location. The femur is the most common long-bone site, followed by the tibia, humerus, and fibula. Ewing's sarcoma is believed to arise from mesenchymal stem cells in the bone marrow.

The best imaging modality for this is MRI. Long-term steroid usage is a risk factor for the development of AVN. MRI allows the identification of avascular necrosis of the femoral head in earlier stages and also helps determine the exact stage and extent of the pathologic process. The X-ray below shows flattening of the femoral head and degenerative changes associated with osteonecrosis or AVN. The radiographic appearance of avascular necrosis of the femoral head may show the following changes: • Sclerosis of the femoral head • Flattening or loss of sphericity of femoral head • Crescent sign - subchondral fracture overlying the necrotic segment of the femoral head • In severe stages, it may show femoral head collapse and arthritic changes in the joint",

      "explanation": "The procedure depicted in the image represents myelography. Myelography is a procedure used to evaluate spinal conditions. X-ray myelography can be used to evaluate the spinal canal in patients with spondylolisthesis. While MRI has largely replaced X-ray myelography, it is done when there is a contraindication to MRI (e.g., non-compatible pacemaker, severe claustrophobia).",

      "explanation": "An empty thecal sac sign is seen in arachnoiditis. Adhesive arachnoiditis can be diagnosed if the empty thecal sac indication is observed. This occurs due to inflammation, which leads to clumping of nerve roots. This leads to an empty sac appearance. It is best observed on T2-weighted MRI scans of the lumbar spine when the thecal sac appears empty.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given X-ray shows a cervical rib. Patients with a cervical rib usually show a lump and tenderness in the supraclavicular fossa. The pallor and paresthesias are due to vascular and neural compressions, respectively. A radiograph of the neck is useful in detecting a cervical rib. However, the absence of a rib on the X-ray does not rule out the possibility of a cervical rib. CT and MRI are more sensitive.",

      "explanation": "The given X-ray of the skull shows multiple radiolucent lytic lesions, typical of the salt and pepper appearance. This is seen in hyperparathyroidism. In hyperparathyroidism, there is resorption of the trabecular bone of the skull (which causes the radiolucent areas) in combination with cystic areas of osteopenia. There is also a loss of definition between the inner and outer tables of the skull. Other options: Option B: In multiple myeloma, multiple well-defined 'punched out' lytic lesions exist. Option C: Untreated hyperthyroidism for several years can lead to osteoporosis of bones. Option D: In Paget's disease, the pelvis, spine, skull, and proximal long bones are most frequently affected. Radiological skull changes include: • Osteoporosis circumscripta: Large, well-defined lytic lesion. • Cotton wool appearance: Mixed lytic and sclerotic lesions of the skull. • Diploic widening: Both inner and outer calvarial tables are involved, with the former usually more extensively affected. • Tam o'Shanter sign: Frontal bone enlargement, with the appearance of the skull falling over the facial bones, like a Tam o'Shanter hat.",
