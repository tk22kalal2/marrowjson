This loss of clear demarcation between the normal lung and its surrounding soft structures (heart, diaphragm) is called the silhouette sign. It occurs due to loss of contrast between lungs and soft tissue when the lung parenchyma is no longer filled with air. This sign may be seen in consolidation, atelectasis, or mass lesions. In the following images: - • Left image: red line indicates the normal demarcation between the right heart border and middle lobe of the right lung. - Right image: loss of demarcation (positive silhouette sign) due to right middle lobe consolidation. Positive silhouette sign and corresponding anatomical site of pathology: • Right heart border: right middle lobe or medial right lower lobe. • Left heart border: lingula segments of the left upper lobe. • Left hemidiaphragm or descending aorta: left lower lobe. • Aortic knuckle: left upper lobe (posterior segment). • Right hemidiaphragm: right lower lobe. • Right paratracheal stripe: right upper lobe.",

        "D": "Single great artery for systemic and pulmonary circulation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Based on the clinical scenario and the X-ray showing a box-shaped cardiac silhouette caused by right atrial enlargement, this is typically seen in Ebstein's anomaly. Ebstein anomaly is characterized by an abnormal tricuspid valve that is displaced downwards into the right ventricle. Hence, a part of the right ventricle is now located above the tricuspid valve. This is called atrialization of the ventricle. There can be associated tricuspid regurgitation with or without stenosis. X-ray findings depend on the degree to which the tricuspid valve is displaced downwards. The features are an enlarged right atrium, which causes severe right-sided cardiomegaly, giving rise to a box-shaped cardiac shadow and pulmonary oligemia. Other options: Option B: Pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect (VSD), aorta overriding the VSD, and right ventricular hypertrophy are the defining features of Tetralogy of Fallot, a cyanotic congenital heart disease. X-ray findings show a characteristic 'coeur-en-sabot' or boot-shaped heart. Option C: Pulmonary veins returning to the right atrium or systemic venous circulation instead of the left atrium define total anomalous pulmonary venous circulation, a congenital cardiac malformation, with the supracardiac variety being the most common. As a result, a large supracardiac shadow can be seen with a normal cardiac shadow and gives a characteristic pattern of snowman appearance/figure of 8 on chest X-ray. Option D: Failure of the embryonic common truncus arteriosus to divide into the aorta and pulmonary artery characterizes truncus arteriosus, a cyanotic congenital heart anomaly. A single great artery arises from the heart, supplying both the pulmonary and systemic circulation. This condition is associated with pulmonary plethora, unlike Tetralogy of Fallot, and is characterized by the sitting duck appearance of the heart on X-ray.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The egg-on-string or egg-on-the-side appearance on chest X-ray is seen in dextro-transposition of great arteries (d-TGA). This appearance is due to altered cardiac contours as a result of cardiomegaly. In d-TGA, the aorta arises from the right ventricle, whereas the pulmonary trunk arises from the left ventricle. d-TGA is also called uncorrected TGA.",

      "explanation": "The given image shows a calcified pericardium, called an egg-in-cup appearance. It is typically seen in constrictive pericarditis. In constrictive pericarditis, there is fibrous or calcific constrictive thickening of the anterior and lateral pericardium that prevents normal diastolic filling of the heart. The resulting diastolic dysfunction leads to features of right heart failure. The thickness of the pericardium is best assessed on MRI. Note: The egg-in-cup (or ball-on-tee) appearance is also a urographic finding seen in renal papillary necrosis.",

      "explanation": "Persistent truncus arteriosus is characterized by the sitting duck appearance of the heart on X-ray. Truncus arteriosus - Sitting Duck Sign: Truncus arteriosus is a cyanotic congenital heart anomaly. A single great artery arises from the heart, due to a failure of the division of the embryonic common truncus arteriosus. Single trunk supplies both the pulmonary and systemic circulation, instead of a separate aorta and a pulmonary trunk. The X-ray findings are similar to those of Tetralogy of Fallot. However, pulmonary plethora is seen in this condition, as opposed to pulmonary oligemia in Tetralogy of Fallot. This is because the pulmonary artery originates from the truncus, which is part of the systemic circulation.",

The given image shows the snowman sign or figure-of-8 or cottage loaf appearance. This is seen in supracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC). The image below shows the snowman appearance of the heart seen in TAPVC. TAPVC is a cyanotic type of congenital heart disease with abnormal drainage anatomy of the entire pulmonary venous system. In obstructive TAPVC, there is a normal-sized heart with severe pulmonary venous hypertension. This results in the ground-glass appearance of the lungs. In TAPVC, all systemic and pulmonary venous blood enters the right atrium and nothing drains into the left atrium.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The normal anatomy of the femoral vessels and great saphenous vein at the saphenofemoral junction on USG is called the Mickey Mouse sign. The given images below show the Mickey Mouse sign (FV - femoral vein; FA - femoral artery; GSV - great saphenous vein). Other options: Option B: String sign (of Kantor) on barium studies appears as a thin, thread-like stream of contrast passing through the stenosed bowel segment, particularly in Crohn's disease. Option C: Tillaux sign is said to be positive if the mass/swelling is mobile perpendicular to the mesentery attachment line. Tillaux's sign is seen in a mesenteric cyst. Option D: Stemmer's sign is the inability to tent the skin at the base of the toes due to skin thickening, as seen in lymphedema.",

      "question": "A 57-year-old woman with chest pain was diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction. What test can detect areas of reversible myocardial ischemia in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Coronary angiography",
        "B": "MUGA Scan",
        "C": "Thallium scan",
        "D": "Resting echocardiography"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "A thallium scan is performed to detect reversible myocardial ischemia. It evaluates myocardial perfusion both at rest and during stress (exercise/pharmacological). In reversible ischemia, a cold spot is seen during exercise or stress due to reduced perfusion, but normal perfusion is observed at rest. Conversely, irreversible infarction is indicated by a cold spot during rest and stress/exercise. In technetium and pyrophosphate scanning, infarct appears as a hot spot. MUGA (multiple gated acquisition) scan is a nuclear imaging test that can evaluate the function of the ventricles. It is used for informed diagnostic intervention in heart failure. Its specific uses are in evaluating the degree of myocardial damage following myocardial infarction and in assessing cardiac dysfunction in patients on cardiotoxic drugs like anthracyclines.",
