      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Non-visualization of the kidney on IVP is seen in the case of multicystic dysplastic kidney(MCDK).MCDK is a form of renal dysplasia characterized by multiple, non-communicating cysts of varyingsizes, separated by dysplastic parenchyma, with the absence of a normal pelvicalyceal system. Itresults from a developmental abnormality due to failure of the renal mesenchyme to unite withthe ureteric bud. This condition is associated with ureteral or ureteropelvic atresia, and theaffected kidney is non-functional.Most cases of MCDK are detected antenatally through ultrasonography. In some cases, the cystsidentified prenatally may regress in utero, resulting in the affected kidney being undetectable onimaging at birth. Renal ultrasonography is the initial investigation of choice. It reveals a soapbubble appearance. Bilateral MCDK can lead to pulmonary hypoplasia and Potter syndrome.The following image shows a non-visualized right kidney (red arrow).336RLOther options:Option A: In the duplicated collecting system, the drooping lily sign is seen. It refers to theinferolateral displacement of the opacified lower pole moiety due to an obstructed (andun-opacified) upper pole moiety.Option B: In polycystic kidney disease, a streaky appearance is seen due to ectatic collecting ducts.Option D: In renal hypoplasia, there is a congenitally small kidney with smaller calyces, lobules,and papillae but essentially normal residual parenchyma. On imaging, a hypoplastic kidney issmall but otherwise normal.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given intravenous urogram shows the inferolateral displacement of the opacified lower poledue to an obstructed (and unopacified) upper pole, referred to as the drooping lily sign, observedin patients with a duplicated collecting system.The duplicated collecting system is a common congenital anomaly of the urinary tractcharacterized by an incomplete fusion of upper and lower pole moieties resulting in a variety ofcomplete or incomplete duplications of the collecting system. It occurs due to the division of theureter as it ascends upwards from the bladder to the renal parenchyma during the embryologicalperiod of life. As a result, the affected individual may have two collecting systems for one kidney.Duplex collecting systems may also be complicated by vesicoureteric reflux, obstruction orureterocoele. When the upper pole ureter is obstructed, the lower pole collecting system appearsdisplaced and stretched on imaging, creating the \"drooping lily\" sign observed in intravenousurography.The Weigert-Meyer law describes the relationship of the upper and lower renal moieties induplicated collecting systems to their drainage. When there are abnormalities associated withduplicating collecting systems,• The upper pole moiety drains inferomedially and is most commonly associated with obstruction.337• The lower pole moiety drains superolaterally and is most commonly associated withvesicoureteral reflux.The illustration given below shows the Weigert-Meyer law.Duplicated collecting systemWeigert-Meyer lawRightMMARLeftMARROWUpperpole ureterLowerpole ureterOpening of ureterfrom left inferiorrenal pelvisOpening of ureterfrom left superiorrenal pelvis",

      "explanation": "The clinical scenario, along with the CT scan showing an enlarged kidney with areas of necrosisand mottled areas of gas collection, is suggestive of left-sided emphysematous pyelonephritis.Emphysematous pyelonephritis is a severe, acute, necrotizing infection of the kidney caused bygas-producing organisms. It predominantly affects diabetic patients who are particularlysusceptible due to their hyperglycemic state, which promotes bacterial growth and fermentation.The most common causative organism is Escherichia coli, which ferments sugar to producecarbon dioxide, leading to gas accumulation within renal parenchyma or perinephric tissues. Lesscommonly, organisms like Klebsiella and Proteus species can also cause this condition.Almost all patients present with fever, vomiting and flank pain. Patients frequently present withsepsis and ketoacidosis. If not treated early, it may lead to fulminant sepsis and is associated withhigh mortality.The diagnosis is primarily established radiographically, with a CT scan being the investigation ofchoice in identifying the extent of the emphysematous process and guiding management.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Sterile pyuria in a patient with history of tuberculosis raises suspicion of renal tuberculosis. Themost sensitive imaging modality for diagnosing renal tuberculosis is CT Intravenous Pyelogram.Renal tuberculosis occurs due to hematogenous dissemination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,making it a secondary infection. There is either reinfection or reactivation of old TB. It is morecommon in males and typically presents with symptoms such as increased urinary frequency,polyuria, dysuria, hematuria, loin pain/suprapubic pain and sterile pyuria.In sterile pyuria, urine appears pale and opalescent due to the presence of pus cells. Renal TB is acause of sterile pyuria. Diagnosis is confirmed with a tuberculin test, or at least 3 consecutiveearly-morning urine specimens are examined for acid-fast bacilli. They are stained with aZiehl-Neelsen stain and subsequently cultured.The most sensitive imaging modality in renal tuberculosis is CT urography/pyelography. NCCT isthe preferred means of visualizing renal calcifications. Manifestations of renal TB as seen on CTare as follows:•Early changes:•Papillary necrosis (single or multiple) and uneven caliectasis• Progressive changes:• Multifocal strictures in any part of the collecting system• Generalized or focal hydronephrosis• Mural thickening and enhancement• Poorly enhancing renal parenchyma, either due to direct involvement or due to hydronephrosis• End-stage:342• Progressive hydronephrosis results in very thin parenchyma, mimicking multiple thin-walledcysts• Amorphous dystrophic calcification eventually involves the entire kidney (known as the puttykidney), as shown below:Moth eatencalyxDAILYROUNDSTuberculosis of the urinary tractParenchymalcalcification-CorticalscarringBeaded ureterCentralpapillarynecrosisHiked-uppelvisOMARROWCortical abscesswith rupture into theperinephric spaceCaseous massUreteral strictureThickened bladder wall(Thimble bladder)Urethral stricture",

This is seen in patients with severe neurogenicbladder and increased sphincter tone.Neurogenic bladder is a term applied to a dysfunctional urinary bladder that results from aninjury to the central or peripheral nerves that control and regulate urination. It causes detrusorsphincter dyssynergia. Neurogenic bladder typically occurs due to suprasacral lesions (aboveS2-S4) or apical lesions (in and around S2-S4).Pine cone bladder is not pathognomonic of a neurogenic bladder. It may also be seen in patientswith lesions anywhere along the sacral reflex arc. Occasionally, it is also seen in bladder neckobstruction of a non-neurogenic cause.Other options:Option A: Tuberculous cystitis results in fibrosis and stiffening of the entire urinary bladder,leading to an inability to expand and a significant reduction in bladder capacity, as depicted in theimage below. The medical term for this feature on micturating cystourethrogram (MCU) is athimble bladder.Option C: In bladder carcinoma, lesions are seen on the wall of the bladder and a biopsy is takento confirm the diagnosis. These lesions cause disruption in the mucosa and the musculature of thebladder. Cystourethroscopy is the mainstay for the diagnosis of bladder carcinoma. It isperformed on patients with hematuria.

AMLs predominantly affect the kidneys, though they can occur in other sites such asthe liver (a common extra-renal location) and less frequently in the ovary, fallopian tube,spermatic cord, palate, and colon.Histologically, angiomyolipomas consist of perivascular epitheloid cells with varying proportionsof vascular, immature smooth muscle cells, and fat cells. Patients with AMLs present with flankpain, a palpable mass, hematuria, recurrent urinary tract infections, hypertension, or renalfailure. Larger tumours increase the risk of complications, such as spontaneous retroperitonealhemorrhage, which can manifest as sudden-onset abdominal or flank pain, along with symptomslike nausea, vomiting, and hypotension.Everolimus is used for the treatment of angiomyolipomas. Treatment should be considered forasymptomatic, growing AMLs measuring &gt;3 cm in diameter.

These signs refer to a dilated, contrast-filled distalureter surrounded by a thin rim of the ureteric wall and bladder mucosa.Ureterocoele is a cystic enlargement of the intramural portion of the ureter, more commonly seenin females than males. It is thought to be caused due to ureteric orifice atresia. They are similar toectopic ureters, which typically drain the upper pole of the kidney and are associated with361dysplastic or non-functional renal tissue.If they present clinically, ureteroceles often manifest with urinary tract infections (UTIs) inchildren, while in adults, they are more likely to present with stones in the lower ureter.Ureterocoeles can enlarge and obstruct the bladder neck or the contralateral ureteric orifice.The classic sign of a ureterocele on intravenous urography is a 'cobra head', 'adder head', or'spring onion sign'. On ultrasonography, it can be seen as a fluid-filled cystic mass in the bladder.The treatment of simple ureteroceles is surgical excision with re-implantation of the ureter.362",
