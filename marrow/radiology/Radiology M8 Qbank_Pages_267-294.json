      "explanation": "The given ultrasound abdomen depicts the target sign suggestive of intussusception.Intussusception occurs when a portion of the bowel is telescoped into an adjacent segment. Themost common location of intussusception is ileocolic. Clinically, it presents with crampingabdominal pain, palpable sausage-shaped abdominal mass, and passage of red currant jelly stools.A plain radiograph may show a meniscus sign, i.e. soft tissue mass contrasting the bowel that isair-filled. The target sign of intestinal intussusception, also known as the doughnut sign or bull'seye sign, is a diagnostic feature observed on abdominal ultrasound. This appearance is due toconcentric alternating echogenic and hypoechogenic bands. The echogenic bands are formed bythe mucosa and muscularis, and the hypoechoic bands are formed by the submucosa.Other ultrasound signs of intussusception include:• Pseudokidney sign - This is seen in the longitudinal section of the bowel. The edematous bowelresembles renal parenchyma, and the mesentery, which is dragged into the intussusception,resembles renal hilum.•Crescent in a doughnut sign - A hyperechoic semilunar structure caused by mesenteric fat pulledinto the intussceptum.The below images show USG films depicting the target sign and pseudo-kidney sign respectively.279-4IGE+TARGET LESION-6TRANSVERSE-81 L 3.44 cmPPseudokidney of intussusceptionRight KidneyDe Ali BasiryfLONG AXIS967",

The more severe form of CDI is known aspseudomembranous colitis (PMC).Toxigenic Clostridium difficile produces toxin A (an enterotoxin) and toxin B (a cytotoxin),damaging the epithelial-cell barrier function and causing diarrhea and pseudomembraneformation, which initially appear as small whitish-yellow plaques and later coalesce to involve theentire colon wall. The patient also presents with fever, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis.On CT imaging, accordion sign, also referred to as concertina sign, may be seen. The termsaccordion or concertina refer to a harmonica like a musical instrument. The thickened edematousbowel resembles the folds of an accordion. The hyperemic-enhancing mucosa stretched over thethickened submucosal folds produces this appearance. This is also seen when the contrast getstrapped between edematous haustral folds and pseudomembranes of the colon.Accordion sign is typical for pseudomembranous colitis but can be also seen in ischemic colitis,AIDS-related colitis, and severe edema from cirrhosis.The CT image below depicts accordion sign:",

The apex of a sigmoid volvulus usually lies high onthe left side. The apex of a caecal volvulus may lie on the right side or extend to the left upperquadrant.

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and the barium enema showing a dilated right colon, with a transitionzone in the mid-descending colon, are together suggestive of Hirschsprung disease.The most important sign on barium enema is a sudden change of calibre from the narrowaganglionic segment and dilated proximal bowel.Hirschsprung disease is characterized by aganglionosis (absence of ganglion cells) in the distalcolon and rectum. This may occur due to the failure of neuroblasts in neural crest cells to migrateinto bowel segments or the degeneration of already migrated neuroblasts. Hence, functionalobstruction develops as a result of a spasm in the denervated colon.Clinical features typically include failure to pass meconium within the first 48 hours of life,abdominal distension, vomiting, and constipation. Hirschsprung disease may present withenterocolitis, a severe complication that can be life-threatening. There is a notable associationbetween Hirschsprung disease and Down's syndrome.Water-soluble contrast enema is the initial investigation and diagnostic test of choice. It shows anarrow aganglionic segment, a conical transition zone, and a dilated proximal bowel. Rectalbiopsy is the gold standard investigation.The image below shows dilated ganglionic and contracted aganglionic segments in Hirschsprungdisease:Hirschsprung diseaseARAganglionicSegment(Contracted)OMARROWGanglionicSegment(Relaxed)",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A newborn presenting with respiratory distress shortly after birth, along with the chest X-rayshowing bowel loops in the thoracic cavity, is suggestive of congenital diaphragmatic hernia(CDH).292Normally, the pleuroperitoneal cavities separate by 8-10 weeks of gestation. CDH is due to afailure to close the pleuroperitoneal canal in the developing fetus. This malformation allows theabdominal organs to push into the chest cavity, impairing lung development and function. Themost common type of CDH is a Bochdalek hernia, which usually involves the left side. Mortality ispredominantly due to the development of pulmonary hypoplasia.Chest X-ray findings in congenital diaphragmatic hernia include:• Bowel loops in the thorax.•Indistinct diaphragm with opacification of part of or all the hemithorax (typically left-sided)• Deviation of lines such as the endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, umbilical arterial and venouscatheters.Given below is the chest radiograph of Bochdalek hernia.Given below is the chest radiograph of Morgagni hernia.293Note: Bag and mask ventilation is to be avoided in the management of this baby. Bag and maskventilation may increase abdominal distension and limit the expansion of the hypoplastic lungs.294",
