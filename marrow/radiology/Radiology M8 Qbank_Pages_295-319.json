      "explanation": "A patient presenting with abdominal pain and vomiting, with CT showing a Mercedes-Benz sign,is characteristic of cholelithiasis.Mercedes-Benz sign (triradiate sign), is seen when a gallstone contains central radiolucent gas.The fissures may be tri-radiate or bi-radiate (seagull sign). These fissures appear dark on CT orradiographs, giving the sign its characteristic appearance.Gallbladder stones or cholelithiasis are the most common condition affecting the gallbladder.They are often discovered incidentally and typically remain asymptomatic. However, they becomesymptomatic when the stones obstruct the cystic duct. In such cases, patients may experience dullor colicky right upper quadrant or epigastric pain radiating to the back, along with symptoms likenausea and vomiting.Only about 10% of gallstones are radiopaque. Ultrasonography (USG) is the most accurate initialimaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of gallbladder stones. These stones appear asechogenic foci producing acoustic shadows.

It is usually seen as an echogenicity along the anterior wall of the right portalvein. In the above image, the arrow represents the fibrous atretic plate at the porta hepatis.Biliary atresia may also be termed as noncystic obliterative cholangiopathy. It is a disease of theintra and extrahepatic bile ducts of unknown etiology.The classification of biliary atresia with the regions involved is as follows:Type I Common bile duct--Type IIa Common hepatic ductType IIb - Common bile duct, hepatic duct, cystic duct.Type III (most common type) - Common bile duct, hepatic duct, cystic duct; no anastomosableducts at porta hepatis.Clinical features include persistent jaundice, clay-colored stools, and hepatomegaly. Untreatednewborns will show signs of liver cirrhosis and failure (ascites, portal hypertension, and failure tothrive).Laboratory evaluation will show elevated levels of direct and indirect bilirubin, alkalinephosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase.

The most common location is in the fundus of the gall bladder andthe sinuses often contain stones.On USG, the characteristic findings are a thickened gallbladder wall showing bright echoes arisingfrom the cystic spaces with 'comet-tail' ring-down artefacts, as seen in the image below. Thecomet-tail artefact is caused by the cholesterol crystals trapped within the Rokitansky-Aschoffsinuses, causing reverberation (large number of reflected waves).",
