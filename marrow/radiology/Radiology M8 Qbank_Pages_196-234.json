Thecysts contain a cholesterol-rich, thick brownish-yellow fluid that is compared to 'machine oil'.Clinical features include headaches (most common), visual abnormalities - decreased acuityand bitemporal hemianopia, GH deficiency, growth failure, delayed sexual maturation due topituitary hypofunction, and polyuria (central diabetes insipidus).Radiologically:•CT may show calcifications associated with the solid and cystic wall components• MRI is the imaging modality of choice which shows:Craniopharyngiomas tend not to expand the pituitary fossa unless they become huge, which is adifferentiating feature from pituitary macroadenomas.Other options:Option A: Pituitary apoplexy is an acute clinical condition associated with the rapid expansion ofthe pituitary gland, which is evident on an MRI as enhancement around a non-enhancinginfarcted centre.Option B: Pituitary macroadenoma (with cystic degeneration or necrosis) shows indentation at thediaphragma sellae, giving rise to a snowman/figure of eight appearance/cottage loaf.

      "explanation": "The given MRI is suggestive of medulloblastomas. It is the most common malignant brain tumorof childhood, and it occurs exclusively in the cerebellum. Irrespective of their histological orgenetic characterization, medulloblastomas correspond histologically to WHO grade IV tumors.Radiological findings include:•CT &amp; MRI: CT shows a hyperdense midline vermian mass adjoining the roof of the 4thventricle and causing hydrocephalus. MRI shows T2 hypointensity or isointensity compared to thegrey matter. The CT and MRI findings also reflect the increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio anddensely packed cells of the tumor.• DWI: restricted diffusion• MR spectroscopy: reduced N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) peak with an increased choline-to-creatineratio.The CT and MRI findings, supported by the presence of restricted diffusion on DWI, are the mostreliable observations in differentiating medulloblastoma from ependymoma or other posteriorfossa tumors.Standard treatment for medulloblastomas includes surgical resection, with adjuvant craniospinalradiotherapy for those over 3 years of age and chemotherapy.Other options:215Option A: Pilocytic astrocytoma is a brain tumor that occurs more often in children and youngadults. These tumors are usually slow-growing and benign. The majority of neoplasms are locatedin the cerebellum. However, they can also appear around the third ventricle, optic nerves, spinalcord, and occasionally in the cerebral hemispheres. Mural nodule, a contrast medium enhancingnodule within the wall of a cystic mass, is seen on MRI.Option C: Ependymomas are tumours that arise from the ependyma-lined ventricular system,typically on the floor of the fourth ventricle. In adults, the spinal cord is their most commonlocation; tumors in this site are particularly frequent in the setting of neurofibromatosis type 2.They are well-demarcated lobulated mass lesions that show calcifications on CT in over 50% andare of mixed signal intensity on MRI.Option D: Craniopharyngiomas are tumors that arise from the remnants of Rathke's pouch. It isan intracranial space-occupying lesion. It has a bimodal age of presentation.

      "explanation": "The given axial T1 MRI is suggestive of meningioma. It involves the mid-falx cerebri and is seen asa spontaneously hyperintense and homogeneously enhanced mass in the midline arising fromfalx.Meningiomas are extra-axial tumours (lesions that are outside of the brain parenchyma). They area non-glial neoplasm that originates from the meningocytes or arachnoid cap cells of themeninges and are located anywhere that meninges are found.Meningioma shows female predominance that may be related to the fact that some meningiomascontain estrogen and progesterone receptors. They are also associated with NF-2 gene mutation.Typical meningiomas appear as dural-based masses isointense to grey matter on both T1 and T2weighted imaging and demonstrate vivid contrast enhancement on both MRI and CT. CSFvascular cleft sign indicates that the mass is extra-axial. There is a cleft between the tumour andnormal brain parenchyma.The image below shows the CSF vascular cleft sign:216Dural tail sign: Refers to the linear extension of enhancement of the dura, beyond the segment onwhich the tumor is based.

MSA has been divided clinically into two forms according to the dominantnon-autonomic symptoms:• MSA-C: Predominance of cerebellar symptoms (olivopontocerebellar atrophy)• MSA-P: Predominance of Parkinsonian signs and symptoms (striatonigral degeneration)MRI is a valuable diagnostic adjunct, often revealing cerebellar and brainstem atrophy causingpontine hot cross bun sign.The axial T2-weighted image at the level of middle cerebellar peduncles below shows the hot crossbun sign:226AOther options:Option B: Multiple system atrophy-parkinsonian type (MSA-P) is characterised by atypicalparkinsonism that is symmetrical and predominantly axial, with tremors less prominentcompared to Parkinson's disease.

      "explanation": "The above clinical presentation, along with the MRI brain showing a cyst with a dot sign(representing an eccentrically placed scolex within a parasitic cyst), is characteristic ofneurocysticercosis.Neurocysticercosis is the most common form of cysticercosis and is caused by encysted larvae ofthe pork tapeworm Taenia solium. This CNS infection typically occurs through the consumptionof food or water contaminated with human feces containing Taenia eggs or via the ingestion ofundercooked pork. It can affect the brain parenchyma, subarachnoid space and ventricles.Clinically, it presents with seizures and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (headache,nausea, vomiting, vision changes), dizziness, ataxia, confusion or signs of meningeal irritation.Parenchymal neurocysticercosis can be categorised into four stages -vesicular, colloidal vesicular,granular nodular, and nodular calcified. These stages are readily identified on MRI or CT,depending on the lesion's progression. It is characterised by cystic lesions with or without ringenhancement, focal enhancing lesions, nodular calcifications or multilobulated cystic lesions inthe subarachnoid space.Viable parasites appear as cystic lesions with a scolex, often visible on MRI, while calcified,non-viable cysts are more effectively identified on CT.Differential diagnoses for ring-enhancing lesions include brain abscess, toxoplasmosis, centralnervous system lymphoma, tuberculoma.Other options:Option B: Tuberculomas (parenchymal granulomas) can mostly occur at the junction of white andgrey matter. On CT, they appear as small rounded lesions, solid lesions show homogenousenhancement on contrast CT and show ring enhancement when central caseation or liquefactionoccurs.

Notably, EBV-associated cases inimmunocompetent individuals may show rim enhancement.Option D: Brain abscess typically presents as a triad of fever, focal neurological deficits and signsof raised intracranial pressure.
