      "explanation": "The above axial CT shows a hyperdense lentiform (biconvex) opacity, consistent with an epidural hematoma, which is a collection of blood between the inner surface of the skull and the outer periosteal layer of the dura mater, typically following a history of trauma. The characteristic biconvex shape arises due to the limited ability of blood to expand within the fixed attachment of periosteal dura to the cranial sutures. If bleeding is significant, it may lead to a mass effect with herniation. Additionally, a swirl sign may be present, representing acute blood extravasation into a hematoma (extradural/subdural), showing fresh, unclotted blood with lower attenuation than the clotted blood (which is of a higher attenuation), highlighting the need for surgical intervention. The following CT image depicts a swirl sign.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario of a declining GCS score following a road traffic accident, combined with the given MRI demonstrating hypointense microhemorrhagic foci, suggests diffuse axonal injury (DAI). Diffuse axonal injury (white matter shearing) is a severe form of traumatic brain injury caused by rotational acceleration/deceleration, leading to axonal shearing or disruption and forming microhemorrhages. Typically, these lesions are located at the grey-white matter junction in the corpus callosum and, in severe cases, the brainstem. MRI is the preferred modality for assessing suspected diffuse axonal injury, even in patients with a normal CT of the brain. Gradient-recalled echo (GRE) and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) are the most sensitive MRI sequences for detecting microbleeds, which appear as hypointense foci.",

Moyamoya disease is a rare, non-inflammatory, progressive, occlusive disease affecting the large intracranial arteries. In this condition, the lenticulostriate arteries form a rich collateral circulation around the occlusive lesions, creating the 'puff of smoke' angiographic appearance, referred to as 'moyamoya' in Japanese. It exhibits a bimodal age distribution, with onset typically occurring in the first and fourth decades of life. The most common presentation is stroke or transient ischemic attacks (TIA), with the nature of these events differing by age group. In childhood, ischemic events are predominant, while hemorrhagic manifestations are frequent in adults.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given CT image demonstrates the Mount Fuji sign, a specific radiological finding of tension pneumocephalus. This sign is characterised by bilateral compression and separation of the frontal lobes due to the trapped subdural and interhemispheric free air, which appears as non-attenuating collections resembling the peak of Mount Fuji. Tension pneumocephalus is a rare, life-threatening condition most commonly caused by traumatic head injury. Other causes include skull base fractures, neurosurgical procedures, infections (meningitis, encephalitis, or brain abscess), brain tumours, or the use of nitrous oxide during anaesthesia. The mass effect exerted by the subdural air compresses the underlying brain parenchyma, often resulting from a ball-valve mechanism causing one-way air entry into the subdural space. This raises intracranial pressure (ICP), distinguishing it from non-tension pneumocephalus, which lacks significant mass effect or raised ICP. The elevated ICP leads to rapid clinical deterioration, such as worsening consciousness, necessitating urgent neurosurgical intervention to decompress the trapped air and prevent permanent brain damage.",

      "explanation": "The best imaging modality for the early diagnosis of cerebral infarction is diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI), which can detect infarcts as early as 30 minutes of onset and identify cytotoxic edema within a few hours of ischemic stroke. However, the initial investigation in suspected stroke cases is non-contrast CT due to its rapid acquisition time, widespread availability, and cost-effectiveness. It helps quickly rule out hemorrhagic stroke and facilitates the timely administration of intravenous tPA in eligible patients.

      "explanation": "The given axial T1WI MRI of the brain shows a well-defined hypointense lesion in the posterior fossa suggestive of hemangioblastoma. Hemangioblastomas are tumors of vascular origin and occur both in patients with Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease as well as sporadically. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease characterizes the development of numerous benign and malignant tumors in different organs. It is associated with a mutation in the VHL tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 3. They are WHO-grade I tumors that can occur in the central nervous system. Features of VHL include pheochromocytoma, CNS hemangioblastoma - cerebellar and spinal, retinal hemangioblastoma, and choroid plexus papilloma. Other options: Option A: Neurofibromatosis is an autosomal-dominant neurocutaneous syndrome of 2 types: NF1 (neurofibromatosis 1) is also called Von Recklinghausen disease. It involves the NF1 gene on chromosome 17. It is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple café-au-lait macules and associated cutaneous neurofibromas. NF2 (Central neurofibromatosis) is caused by the mutation on chromosome 22 and predisposes individuals to multiple nervous system tumors. Most common are bilateral vestibular schwannomas, intracranial and spinal meningiomas, gliomas, neurofibromas, and posterior subcapsular lenticular opacities. On MRI, extracanalicular extension of vestibular schwannomas into the cerebellopontine angle can lead to an 'ice cream cone' appearance as shown below: Option C: Tuberous sclerosis is a multi-system neurocutaneous syndrome caused by the mutation of genes coding for hamartin (chromosome 9) and tuberin (chromosome 16), which leads to the formation of angiomyolipomas, cysts in kidneys, multiple hamartomas, giant cell astrocytomas, and cortical tubers. Skin manifestation includes facial angiofibroma (adenoma sebaceum), shagreen patch and confetti skin lesions. It can also be associated with renal angiomyolipoma and cardiac rhabdomyoma. The CT image given below shows calcified subependymal hamartomatous nodules: Tuberous sclerosis - CT brain findings - Calcified subependymal hamartomatous nodules. Option D: Sturge Weber syndrome is a neurocutaneous disorder (phakomatoses) that is characterized by unilateral capillary malformation at the region of trigeminal supply known as port wine stain or nevus flammeus, ipsilateral diffuse cavernous hemangioma of the choroid and ipsilateral leptomeningeal hemangiomatosis, which causes seizures and mental retardation. Features of MRI brain include pial angioma, seen as a diffuse pial enhancement of variable thickness, enlargement of the ipsilateral choroid plexus and dilatation of trans-parenchymal veins that communicate between the superficial and deep cerebral venous systems. MRI and CT show intracranial calcification respectively. The tram-track sign in the brain refers to the parallel calcification of the cerebral cortex.

      "explanation": "The MR-Angiography shown is of Vein of Galen Malformation. Vein of Galen aneurysmal malformations (VGAMs), also known as median prosencephalic arteriovenous fistula, are uncommon intracranial anomalies that tend to present in early childhood with features of a left-to-right shunt and high-output cardiac failure. The vein of Galen, also known as the great cerebral vein or great vein of Galen, is a short trunk formed by the union of the two internal cerebral veins and basal veins of Rosenthal. It lies in the quadrigeminal cistern. It curves backwards and upward around the posterior border of the splenium of the corpus callosum and drains the anterior and central regions of the brain into the sinuses of the posterior cerebral fossa.",

      "question": "A 30-year-old woman has been experiencing intermittent visual disturbances and episodes of difficulty walking over the past few months. Neurological examination reveals spasticity in the lower limbs and hyperreflexia. T2W MRI of the brain shows periventricular ovoid hyperintense lesions oriented perpendicular to lateral ventricles. Which of the radiological findings is most characteristic of this condition?",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "This patient's clinical features and T2W MRI of the brain showing periventricular ovoid hyperintense lesions oriented perpendicular to lateral ventricles, called Dawson's fingers, are characteristic of multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system characterized by inflammation, multiple demyelinating plaques, and relapsing and remitting symptoms. It is commonly associated with paresthesia (tingling sensations), hypesthesia (numbness), optic neuritis, unilateral/bilateral limb weakness - spastic paralysis, Babinski's sign positive, and bladder dysfunction. Optic neuritis (ON) presents as diminished visual acuity or decreased color perception (desaturation) in the central field of vision. MRI is used for making the diagnosis of MS due to its high sensitivity. The diagnosis of MS requires demonstrating that the lesions are disseminated in space (involving multiple areas of the brain) and in time (multiple episodes over a period of time). The MRI below demonstrates Dawson's fingers, the demyelinating plaques through the corpus callosum, arranged at right angles along medullary veins (callososeptal location). Other options: Option A: A 'puff of smoke appearance', derived from the Japanese term Moyamoya, is a characteristic finding on cerebral X-ray angiography in patients with Moyamoya disease. This rare, non-inflammatory, progressive, occlusive disease involves large intracranial arteries exhibiting bimodal age distribution in the first and fourth decades. Childhood Moyamoya is characterized by ischemic manifestations, and adult Moyamoya by hemorrhagic manifestations. The below image shows the MR angiography findings in a patient with Moyamoya disease. As this is a chronic condition, the lenticulostriate arteries develop a rich collateral circulation around the occlusive lesion, seen as a 'puff of smoke' (moyamoya in Japanese) on X-ray angiography. Option B: Metachromatic leukodystrophy is an autosomal-recessive disease resulting from a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A, causing central and peripheral demyelination, ataxia, and dementia. Symmetric confluent areas of T2 hyperintensity are seen in the periventricular white matter. Radiating T2 hypointense lines through the demyelinated deep white matter represent the sparing of the perivascular white matter. This results in the tigroid and leopard skin patterns when imaged in the long axis or cross-section, respectively. Subcortical U-fibers are spared. The below MRI shows a tigroid pattern. Option D: Progressive supranuclear palsy is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by atrophy of structures at the midbrain-diencephalic junction (e.g., superior colliculi, red nuclei, subthalamic nuclei, and globus pallidus) and cerebellum (dentate nuclei), and mild cortical atrophy. MRI shows a hummingbird sign (atrophy of midbrain structures with a relatively intact pons region).",
