      "explanation": "The Bragg peak effect is pronounced in protons.The proton is a heavy and charged particle that gradually loses its speed as it interacts withhuman tissue. It is easily controlled and delivers its maximum dose at a precise depth and can goas far as 32 cm. The absorbed dose increases very gradually with greater depth and lower speed,388suddenly rising to a peak when the proton is ultimately stopped. This is known as the Bragg peak.The behavior of the proton can be precisely determined, and the beam can be directed, allowingthe Bragg peak to occur within the tumor site. Immediately following this burst of energy, theprotons cease radiating and come to a complete stop. This property of proton therapy enablestargeting tumors within the body, delivering radiation directly to the tumor while sparing thesurrounding healthy cells, offering a much less invasive alternative to treat cancer.The Bragg curve shown below plots the energy loss of ionizing radiation during its travel throughmatter.Stopping Power (MeV/cm)Energy Loss of Alphas of 5.49 MeV inAir (Stopping Power of Air for Alphasof 5.49 MeV)01234Path Length [cm]",
