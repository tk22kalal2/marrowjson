Clozapine, contrary to many other atypicalantipsychotics, has not been found to be useful in the treatment of tics (including Tourette'ssyndrome).Treatment modalities used for Tourette's syndrome (in order of preference):• Detection and treatment of co-morbidities like OCD, ADHD, depression, and anxiety.• Education and behavioral treatments-habit reversal, exposure, and response prevention arethe behavioral treatments of choice.• Adrenergic alpha-2 agonists (always to be tried first before starting antipsychotics) -clonidine and guanfacine are found to be effective.•Antipsychotics aripiprazole and risperidone are effective and preferred over typical-antipsychotics. Pimozide and haloperidol may be more efficient but are often poorly tolerated andneed constant monitoring.Note: Botulinum toxin has been used to treat painful focal motor tics affecting the neck muscles.",
