      "explanation": "Pica is defined as the persistent eating of nonnutritive substances. It can emerge in children,adolescents, or adults (usually pregnant women).A minimum of 2 years of age is suggested by DSM-5 for the diagnosis of pica.Pica is more common among children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder andintellectual disability.The clinical implications can be benign or life-threatening, depending on the objects ingested.Among the most serious complications are:• Lead poisoning - usually after ingestion of lead-based paint346• Intestinal parasites after ingestion of soil or feces-• Anemia and zinc deficiency after ingestion of clay•-Intestinal obstruction - from the ingestion of hairballs, stones, or gravel.No definitive treatment exists for pica. Most treatment is aimed at education and behaviormodification. Medical complications that develop secondarily to the pica must be treated.",
