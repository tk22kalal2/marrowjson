In catastrophic reactions, patients overreact and become agitated when confronted with their cognitive limitations or when facing changes in routine or environment. It is frequently seen in elderly patients with dementia. Option A: The given scenario is not a brief psychotic episode because of the absence of psychotic symptoms. Option B: Altruism is the selfless behavior of helping another member of the community; putting another person's need before one's own and learning that there is value in giving to others. Option C: Catharsis is the expression of ideas, thoughts, and suppressed material that is accompanied by an emotional response that produces a state of relief in the patient.",

Microscopically, the following are seen: • Neuritic plaques containing amyloid-β • Neurofibrillary tangles - containing abnormally phosphorylated tau proteins • Amyloid-β accumulation in the blood vessel walls of the cortex and leptomeninges. Option A: In Korsakoff syndrome, there is inactivation (not hyperactivation) of mammillary bodies due to thiamine deficiency. Option C: Alzheimer's disease initially affects the parietal and temporal lobe, followed by the frontal lobe in the later stages. Hence, personality changes are a late feature of Alzheimer's. Option D: Mesial temporal lobe atrophy is very sensitive to Alzheimer's disease.",

Pick's disease presents with early personality changes (frontal lobe involvement) and loss of social restraints initially, followed by memory loss. By contrast, Alzheimer's patients present with memory loss first and then develop personality changes. Other features include loss of insight, easy distractibility, reduced concern or empathy for others, emotional lability or withdrawal, impulsiveness, poor self-care, and perseveration. There is a second type of presentation of FTD, which is characterized by an early and progressive change in language, with problems of expression of language or severe naming difficulty, and problems with word meaning. The classic imaging findings seen in FTD are preferential atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes with occipitoparietal sparing. Histopathology: Pick cells (swollen neurons) in affected areas of the brain, Pick bodies (intraneuronal argentophilic inclusions).",
