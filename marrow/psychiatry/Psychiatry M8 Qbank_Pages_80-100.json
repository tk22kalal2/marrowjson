      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms, including speaking to himself and hearing two people talk about him, indicate hallucinations and delusions, respectively. Reduced affect and impaired judgment are also characteristic of schizophrenia. Since these symptoms have been present for more than 6 months, the diagnosis is likely schizophrenia.",

      "options": {
        "A": "NMDA receptor hypoactivity in the prefrontal cortex",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Dopaminergic hyperactivity in the subcortical regions is seen in schizophrenia. All of the following neurotransmitters have been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia: Dopamine - dopaminergic hyperactivity in the subcortical region and hypoactivity in prefrontal cortical regions is seen. It is linked to positive symptoms and cognitive deficits respectively. Serotonin excess is linked to both positive and negative symptoms. Norepinephrine - selective neuronal degeneration within the norepinephrine reward neural system is thought to be responsible for anhedonia, a feature of schizophrenia. GABA has a regulatory effect on dopamine activity. In some patients, there is a loss of inhibitory GABAergic neurons, which could indirectly lead to the hyperactivity of dopaminergic neurons. Increased GABAA receptor binding has been reported in the prefrontal and cingulate cortices and the hippocampus. Acetylcholine and nicotine - decreased levels of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors in the hippocampus are seen. NMDA - N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor hypoactivity is seen in the prefrontal cortex.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "This scenario describes an abnormal family dynamic, where one parent is overly close to the child of the opposite gender. This is known as marital schism. Marital schism, marital skew, expressed emotions, and double bind refer to abnormalities of family dynamics. They act as psychosocial stressors, hampering the adaptive capacity of the individual, thus contributing to the development of schizophrenia. Marital schism - one parent is overly close to the child of the opposite gender. Marital skew - a disharmonious situation where one parent dominates over the other. Expressed emotions - parents or other caregivers may behave with overt criticism, hostility, or over-involvement towards a person with schizophrenia, which further worsens the illness. Double bind - a hypothetical family in which children receive conflicting parental messages about their behavior, attitudes, and feelings.",

        "D": "Thought insertion"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Ambivalence is not a Schneiderian first-rank symptom of schizophrenia. It is one of the 4A's of schizophrenia as described by Bleuler. The first rank symptoms of schizophrenia described by Kurt Schneider include: 1. Hallucination: First-person hallucination (audible thoughts) - auditory hallucinations of the person's own voice being spoken aloud. Second-person hallucination (voices directly addressing the patient) - auditory hallucinations of one or more voices talking directly to the person. They can be persecutory, complimentary, or issue commands (command hallucination). Third-person hallucination (voices speaking about the patient) - auditory hallucinations of one or more voices speaking about the person. The voice may deliver a running commentary or the voices may be arguing/discussing the person. 2. Thought phenomenon: Thought withdrawal - thoughts being actively removed from a person's mind. Thought insertion - thoughts inserted into a person's mind by some external agent. Thought broadcasting - the sense that a person's thoughts are experienced by others - the thoughts are made audible or may be experienced by others through telepathy. 3. Made phenomenon: Made affect - feelings are imposed on that person by an external agent. Made impulses or drives - an impulse for action is imposed on a person by some external agent. Made volitional acts - a person's actions are controlled by an external agent; the passive participant in the action. 4. Delusional perception - the person attaches an abnormal significance/meaning to a normal perception, which leads to delusional interpretation. The most common delusion in schizophrenia is the delusion of persecution. These persecutory fears of the patient can range from transient doubts to profound convictions that people are plotting to have them tortured or killed. 5. Somatic passivity - tactile or visceral hallucinations that are thought to be imposed on a person's body by some external agent. These symptoms are not specific to schizophrenia and may also be present in other psychiatric disorders.",

It is common in head trauma, metabolic encephalopathy, and Alzheimer's disease. Symptoms of schizophrenia can be classified as positive or negative. Anything abnormal added to a patient's life is a positive symptom and anything normal lost from a patient's life is a negative symptom.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of brief psychotic episode (DSM-5), as the symptoms are present for less than 30 days. The diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder in DSM-5 is based on the presence of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms for a period of at least 1 day but less than 1 month: • Delusions • Hallucinations • Thought disorder as evidenced by disorganized speech • Disorganized or catatonic behavior. DSM-5 specifies that one of the first three symptoms must be present for the diagnosis to be made.

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario points toward the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. DSM-5 criteria for schizoaffective disorder: \n   1. An uninterrupted period of illness where there is a mood episode (depression or mania) concurrent with psychosis (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, etc.).\n   2. Delusions or hallucinations (psychotic symptoms) for at least two weeks in the absence of a major depressive or manic episode during the lifetime course of the illness.\n   3. Mood symptoms present for the majority of total illness. Not due to intake of substances or another medical condition.\n   Differential diagnosis: \n   1. Major depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features: Psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during mood episodes.\n   2. Schizophrenia: Mood symptoms are absent or present for only brief periods during the course of the illness dominated by psychotic symptoms.\n   Note: According to DSM-5 guidelines, for a definitive diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, there have to be two psychotic episodes. One of the psychotic episodes has to be concurrent with a severe affective (depression or manic) episode. The other psychotic episode should be for two or more weeks in the absence of affective symptoms. And affective symptoms should dominate the major part during the lifetime course of the illness.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of self-mutilation in a patient with schizophrenia is known as Van Gogh syndrome. Van Gogh was a Dutch painter who suffered from schizophrenia. He cut off his ear during one of his psychotic episodes. Pfropf syndrome is schizophrenia associated with mental retardation. 'Pfropf' is the German word for 'graft'. Pfropf schizophrenia literally means schizophrenia grafted on preexisting mental retardation. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is characterized by neurological abnormalities, self-mutilative behavior, and the overproduction of uric acid. It occurs due to a complete deficiency of HGPRTase enzyme (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase). Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome occurs due to a partial deficiency of HGPRTase, and is associated with hyperuricemia but no central nervous system manifestations.",
