      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario is suggestive of the learned helplessness theory of depression. The theory connects depressive phenomena to the experience of uncontrollable events. It was proposed by Martin Seligman. Another good example of this can be a situation of domestic abuse where women tend to leave several times before doing so for good. A person may believe that they can never escape the abuser, even when help and support are available. Option B: The theory of psychosocial development was proposed by Erik Erikson. There are 8 stages of psychosocial development. He states that there are critical time periods, each of which poses a particular psychosocial conflict to the individual. The resolution of this conflict results in either psychosocial growth or regression. Option C: Psychodynamic theory of development explains personality in terms of the interaction between the conscious and unconscious forces of Id, ego, and super-ego. Option D: Social learning theory is a theory of the learning process and social behavior which proposes that new behaviors can be acquired by observing and imitating others.",

      "question": "Detailed Explanations145According to the WHO global health statistics 2020, anxiety disorder is the mostcommon psychiatric illness in the world.Solution to Question 2:Worthlessness is a component of Beck's cognitive triad of depression. It is also known as thenegative triad.Aaron Beck's cognitive triad consists of:• Negative views about one's self - A tendency to devalue to feel personally inadequate(Worthlessness)• Negative views about the world - A tendency to feel that there is no help available (Helplessness)• Negative views about the future - The expectation of suffering and failure (Hopelessness)Anhedonia Decreased ability to experience pleasure.-Solution to Question 3:The clinical scenario is suggestive of the learned helplessness theory of depression. The theoryconnects depressive phenomena to the experience of uncontrollable events. It was proposed byMartin Seligman.Another good example of this can be a situation of domestic abuse where women tend to leaveseveral times before doing so for good. A person may believe that they can never escape theabuser, even when help and support are available.Option B: The theory of psychosocial development was proposed by Erik Erikson. There are 8stages of psychosocial development. He states that there are critical time periods, each of whichposes a particular psychosocial conflict to the individual. The resolution of this conflict results ineither psychosocial growth or regression.Option C: Psychodynamic theory of development explains personality in terms of the interactionbetween the conscious and unconscious forces of Id, ego, and super-ego.Option D: Social learning theory is a theory of learning process and social behavior whichproposes that new behaviors can be acquired by observing and imitating others.Solution to Question 4:The given clinical scenario of low mood along with reduced appetite, reduced interest insocialization, somatic symptoms, and disturbed sleep, points towards a diagnosis of depression(major depressive disorder). Cortisol levels are increased in depression.The diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder are as follows:146A. Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2 week period. Atleast one of the symptoms is either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure.• Depressed mood most of the day• Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities (anhedoni",

The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, orother important areas of functioning.C. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or to another medicalcondition.D. The occurrence of the major depressive episode is not better explained by:• Schizoaffective disorder•Schizophrenia•Schizophreniform disorder• Delusional disorder• Another specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum, or other psychotic disorders.E. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode.Note: The levels of norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine are decreased in depressionSolution to Question 5:The given clinical scenario is suggestive of depression (major depressive disorder). It is associatedwith a premature loss of deep (slow-wave) sleep.Sleep changes in depression:• A premature loss of deep (slow-wave) sleep• An increase in nocturnal arousal manifested as:• An increase in nocturnal awakenings•A reduction in total sleep time• Increased phasic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep147•Increased core body temperatureThe combination of increased REM drive and decreased slow-wave sleep results in a significantreduction in the first period of non-REM (NREM) sleep, a phenomenon referred to as reducedREM latency.Solution to Question 6:Atrophy of the mesial temporal lobe particularly the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex andperirhinal cortex is an MRI change seen in Alzheimer's disease (and not depression).The MRI changes seen in depression are:• Reduction in volume of cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus••Compromised function in the prefrontal area during the implementation of a cognitive taskHyperactivity of the limbic system (including the amygdala) during an emotional taskSolution to Question 7:The given clinical scenario is suggestive of leaden paralysis and it refers to a feeling of extremeheaviness, usually in the arms or legs resulting in the difficulty of moving the limbs. It is seen inatypical depression.Atypical depression is characterized by:•• Low mood• Increased sleep••• Increased appetite• Weight gain• Becomes sensitive to any comments• Leaden paralysisNote: Involutional melancholia is a severe depressive state seen exclusively in people between40-65 years. It is usually associated with the delusions of persecution and nihilism.Solution to Question 8:The given clinical scenario of persistent low mood, anhedonia, guilt, and self-critical thoughtcontent along with nihilistic delusion (rotten intestine), points towards a diagnosis of majordepression with psychotic features.Differentiating features of grief and depression have been enlisted in the following table:Note: Tricyclic antidepressants are considered to be the first-line drugs for psychotic depression.148GriefFeelings of emptyness and loSSDysphoria comes in waves and tends to decrease in intentsity over timeAssociated with thoughts andreminders of deceased/lossMay be present along with positive emotions and humorThought content associatedwith thoughts and memoriesof deceased/lossSelf-esteem is generally preservedIdeas of death focused on joining the deceasedDepressionPersistent low mood and inability to anticipate pleasureLow mood tends to be persistent and consistentNot tied to specific thoughtsand pre-occupationsPervassive unhappiness andmiseryThought content associatedwith self-critical and pessimistic ruminationsWorthlessness and self-loathing is commonIdeas of death focused on ending life due to hopelessnessSolution to Question 9:The given clinical scenario of guilt, hopelessness, and difficulty in concentrating over a period ofmore than 2 years, is suggestive of dysthymia (persistent depressive disorder).The DSM 5 and ICD-11 criteria for diagnosis of dysthymia:A. Depressed mood for most of the day as indicated by either subjective account or observation byothers, for at least 2 years. In children and adolescents at least 1 year.B. Presence of two (or more) of the following while being depressed.• Poor appetite or overeating•Insomnia or hypersomnia••Low energy or fatigue• Low self-esteem• Poor concentration and/or difficulty making decisions• Feelings of hopelessnessC. During the 2-year period (1 year for children or adolescents) of the disturbance, the individualhas never been without the symptoms in criteria A and B for more than 2 months at a time.D. Criteria for a major depressive disorder may be continuously present for 2 years.E. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode, and criteria have never beenmet for cyclothymic disorder.149F. The disturbance is not better explained by a persistent schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia,delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychoticdisorders.G. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug ofabuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g. hypothyroidism).H. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, orother important areas of functioning.Option C: Adjustment disorder is characterized by emotional or behavioral symptoms thatdevelop within 3 months of exposure to an identifiable stressor and usually do not last more than6 months after the stressor ends.Option D: Cyclothymic disorder is symptomatically a mild form of bipolar II disorder,characterized by episodes of hypomania and mild depression.Solution to Question 10:Double depression is the most probable diagnosis in this scenario. Dysthymia and majordepressive disorder in the same period constitute double depression.From the given history:••Features of low mood, fatigue, and insomnia for more than 2 years point towards dysthymia.• Features of low mood, fatigue, insomnia, anhedonia, and suicidal thoughts for more than 2weeks point towards major depressive disorder.Solution to Question 11:The given clinical scenario is suggestive of postpartum blues.It is characterized by a labile mood, sadness, and subjective confusion. It is thought to be due tochanges in hormone levels, the stress of childbirth, and anxiety about the responsibilities ofmotherhood. This usually resolves spontaneously.If symptoms last longer than 2 weeks, an evaluation for postpartum depression is needed.Note: Zuranolone is the first-ever oral drug to be approved specifically for the treatment ofpostpartum depression. It is a neuroactive steroid that enhances the action of GABA in the brainand regulates mood.Solution to Question 12:From the given clinical scenario the patient is showing features of postpartum psychosis(depression with psychotic features). It can often begin within a few days following delivery,although the mean time of onset is usually within 2 to 4 weeks of delivery.150Characteristically, the patient begins to complain of fatigue, episodes of tearfulness, andemotional lability. Later develops, suspiciousness, confusion, irrational statements, and obsessiveconcerns about the baby's health and welfare may be present. Patients eventually developdelusions that involve the idea that the baby is dead or defective. Hallucinations if present mayinvolve voices telling the patient to harm the baby or herself.Solution to Question 13:Postpartum blues is common in mothers in the puerperal period and requires nothing more thaneducation and support. It is characterised by a labile mood, sadness and subjective confusion. It isthought to be due to changes in hormone levels, the stress of childbirth and anxiety about theresponsibilities of motherhood.If symptoms last longer than 2 weeks, an evaluation for postpartum depression is needed.Solution to Question 14:The given scenario is suggestive of depression. Desipramine is the safest to use amongst the givenoptions, for depression during pregnancy.Antidepressants and pregnancy:Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCA):• Cross the placenta.••Imipramine - not safe, due to high anticholinergic and hypotensive propertiesDesipramine, nortriptyline - recommendedNeonatal withdrawal effects are frequent and mildMono Amine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAO-I):• Should be avoided in pregnancy, as they increase the risk of hypertensive crisis•• Associated with pulmonary hypertension in newbornsSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI):•Associated with preterm delivery and spontaneous abortions• Paroxetine - shows cardiac abnormalities in newborns• Citalopram, Sertraline safer drugs-• Neonate shows serotonin toxicity and withdrawal symptomsNote: Antipsychotic drugs like olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone are considered safe duringpregnancy.Solution to Question 15:151SSRIs should be continued for 6-9 months after complete remission of symptoms in a patient witha single episode of depression.Treatment of depression:•⚫ In recent onset mild depression, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is preferred andantidepressants are not recommended.• For moderate to severe depression and dysthymia - Antidepressants (SSRIs) + CBT.⚫ For treatment resistant depression, recommended strategies include augmentation with lithiumor an antipsychotic or the addition of a second antidepressant.• For severe and treatment-resistant depression - Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can also beused.The various classes of drugs used in depression and anxiety are listed below:Class of drugsSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI)Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitorsTricyclic antidepressantsExamplesFluoxetine Fluvoxamine ParoxetineSertralineCitalopramVenlafaxineDesvenlafaxineDuloxetine MilnacipranAmitriptylineImipramineNortriptylineDesipramineAmoxapineAtypical antipsychoticsAripiprazoleOlanzapineQuetiapineRisperidoneMonoamine oxidase inhibitor IsocarboxazidSelegilinePhenes (MAO)Atypical antidepressantsIzineBupropionTrazodoneMirtazapineMianserinSolution to Question 16:Suicidal thoughts or behavior are a side effect of TCAs. Therefore, the attendants of the patientshould be warned regarding this when a patient gets discharged after being treated with TCAs fora major depressive episode.Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are drugs that act by inhibiting the reuptake of noradrenalineand serotonin from the synaptic clefts.The side effects of TCAs are due to blockade of other receptors:●Muscarinic M receptors- constipation, dry mouth, arrhythmia• Histamine H1 receptors- sedation• 5HT receptors - weight gain due to increased appetite• Alpha1 receptors postural hypotension.-152Solution to Question 17:Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the treatment of choice for depression with suicidal thoughtsand refractory depression.Modified ECT uses short-acting anaesthesia and short-acting muscle relaxants.Treatment of depression:•⚫ In recent onset mild depression, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is preferred andantidepressants are not recommended.• For moderate to severe depression and dysthymia - Antidepressants (SSRIs) + CBT.•⚫ For treatment resistant depression, recommended strategies include augmentation with lithiumor an antipsychotic or the addition of a second antidepressant• For severe and treatment-resistant depression - Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can also beused.Somatic and newer treatment modalities for depression include:• Vagus nerve stimulation for resistant depression•• Repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation⚫ Phototherapy• Deep brain stimulation.Solution to Question 18:Lithium is a mood stabilizer with an anti-suicidal role.Maintenance treatment with lithium has been shown to significantly decrease the rate of suicidein patients diagnosed with mood disorders when compared to other mood stabilizers such ascarbamazepine, lamotrigine, and valproate.Lithium is also used as an augmentation agent in treatment-resistant depression. Recurrentdepression with a cyclic pattern can be controlled by either lithium or imipramine.Solution to Question 19:The given clinical scenario points towards a diagnosis of recurrent depressive disorder. Longepisode duration is a risk factor for recurrent depression.Risk factors:•Family history of depressionRecurrent dysthymia153• Concurrent non affective psychiatric illness• Female gender••Long episode duration• Degree of treatment resistance•Chronic medical illness• Social factors (lack of confiding relationships and psychosocial stressors)Solution to Question 20:The above scenario of an elderly depressed patient with memory loss and dementia syndrome issuggestive of pseudodementia. This syndrome has been termed as dementia syndrome ofdepression/depression with reversible dementia. The condition may improve or even completelysubside after the remission of depression.Pseudodementia is a condition that appears similar to dementia but does not have neurologicaldegeneration. Such patients commonly complain of impaired concentration and forgetfulness.Solution to Question 21:Anaclitic depression, also known as hospitalism, is a type of depression in infants where suddenseparation from their primary caregivers leads to depression, withdrawal, nonresponsiveness, andloss of milestones in the infants. However, they recover when their mothers return or whensurrogate mothering is available.Solution to Question 22:In the given image, the arrow indicates Veraguth's sign or Veraguth's fold, a diagonal palpebralfold running from the lateral corners of the eyes, medially upward to the medial end of theeyebrows. It is a physical sign of depression.Another physical sign of depression is the Omega sign. In this, there is vertical wrinkling betweenthe eyebrows joined at the top by a horizontal crease.154Omega signOmega Sign and Veraguth's SignOMARROWVeraguth'ssignNSolution to Question 23:Sleep-onset insomnia is a characteristic feature of anxiety disorder, not melancholia.Melancholia is one of the oldest terms used in psychiatry, to describe the dark mood ofdepression. It is still used to refer to a state of depression characterized by:• Severe anhedonia•• Early morning awakening (terminal insomnia)•Weight loss• Profound feelings of guilt (often over trivial events)Melancholia is sometimes referred to as \"endogenous depression\" or depression that arises in theabsence of external life stressors or precipitants.Solution to Question 24:Persons with hysteroid dysphoria respond well to treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors.Hysteroid dysphoria is a type of atypical depression. The following features can be seen in thiscondition:• Reversed vegetative symptoms:• Insomnia• Tendency to oversleep and to overeat•Mood worsens in the evening• Extreme sensitivity to rejection (hallmark feature)155•Impaired anticipatory pleasure (prediction of pleasure from a future reward), but affectedpersons are capable of mood reactivity i.e., their mood brightens in response to positive events•Craving for chocolate• Like patients with bipolar depression, they respond preferentially to monoamine oxidaseinhibitors (MAOIs).Solution to Question 25:Major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern is the most likely diagnosis in this scenario.Features of major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern:• Onset and remission of major depressive episodes at specific times of the year.•• In most cases, the episodes begin in the fall or winter and remit in spring.• This pattern of onset and remission of episodes must have occurred during at least a 2-yearperiod, without any•nonseasonal episodes during this period.In addition, the seasonal depressive episodes must substantially outnumber any nonseasonaldepressive episodes over the individual's lifetime.• Absence of seasonally linked psychosocial stressors (e.g., seasonal unemployment or schoolschedule).•Major depressive episodes that occur in a seasonal pattern are often characterized by prominentenergy, hypersomnia, overeating, weight gain, and a craving for carbohydrates.Note: According to ICD-11, seasonal depressive disorder is included under recurrent depressivedisorders.Solution to Question 26:Major depressive disorder is the most likely diagnosis in this case.DSM-V criteria for diagnosis of depression:• Depressed mood most of the day• Anhedonia- diminished interest in day-to-day activities•Significant weight loss or weight gain and/or change in appetite.• Insomnia or hypersomnia•Psychomotor agitation or retardation•Feelings of worthlessness or excessive, inappropriate guilt.• Fatigue or loss of energy• Diminished ability to think or concentrate, indecisiveness156• Recurrent thoughts of death and suicideAt least five out of nine symptoms must be present over a two-week periodand one symptom must be depressed mood or anhedonia.Major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern (option",
