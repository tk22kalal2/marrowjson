      "explanation": "Intermittent explosive disorder manifests as discrete episodes of losing control of aggressiveimpulses. The symptoms, which patients may describe as spells or attacks, appear within minutesor hours and, regardless of duration, remit spontaneously and quickly. One discrete episode doesnot justify the diagnosis.A minimum age of 6 years is required to diagnose this condition and it is more commonly seen inmen than women. These episodes can result in serious assault or the destruction of property. Theaggressiveness expressed is grossly out of proportion to any stressors that may have helped elicitthe episodes.After each episode, patients usually show genuine regret or self-reproach. Signs of generalizedimpulsivity or aggressiveness are absent between episodes.",
