      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given pedigree describes an X-linked recessive disorder. The genetic disorder associated withintellectual disability that follows the given pattern of inheritance is Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.The disorder results from mutations in the gene coding for the enzyme hypoxanthine-guaninephosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), leading to deficient enzyme activity. This defect results in319increased uric acid production and hyperuricemia.Mode of inheritance of diseases causing intellectual disability:• Autosomal dominant: Apert syndrome, Tuberous sclerosis, Neurofibromatosis• Autosomal recessive: Galactosemia, Phenylketonuria, Homocystinuria, Hurler's syndrome,Tay-Sachs disease• X-linked recessive: Lesch Nyhan syndrome, Hunter's syndrome.Note: Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked disease. It has atypical pedigree features of an X-linkedrecessive pattern. For instance, 30-50% of female carriers are affected by intellectual disabilityand have other features.",
