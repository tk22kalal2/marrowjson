      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Lithium, diazepam, and bupropion should be withheld before a session of ECT. Lithium combined with ECT has been shown to cause prolonged seizures (lasting more than 180 seconds) and increased postictal delirium. Doses are withheld for 24 hours prior to treatment, allowing for washout. Medications to be withheld before ECT: • Lithium causes prolonged seizures and increased postictal delirium • Benzodiazepines - have anticonvulsant activity • Clozapine is associated with late-appearing seizures • Bupropion is associated with late-appearing seizures. Medications that should not be used during ECT: • Lidocaine markedly increases seizure threshold • Theophylline increases the duration of seizures • Reserpine further compromises respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Note: Tardive seizure is a rare complication of ECT. These are seizures that occur after the completion of treatment once the patient has regained consciousness. The use of β-lactam antibiotics and ciprofloxacin has been associated with tardive seizures.",

      "options": {
        "A": "An effective seizure should last for at least 2 minutes",
        "B": "ECT treatments are usually administered twice or thrice weekly, non-consecutively",

        "D": "All of the above"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "ECT consists of sessions that are scheduled 2-3 times weekly on non-consecutive days. Twice-weekly treatments are associated with less memory impairment than thrice-weekly treatments. For a seizure to be effective in the course of ECT, it should last at least 25 seconds. Treatment should continue until the patient achieves what is considered the maximal therapeutic response. The point of maximal improvement is usually thought to occur when a patient fails to continue to improve after two consecutive treatments. Further treatment does not yield any therapeutic benefit but increases the severity and duration of the adverse effects. If a patient does not improve after 6 to 10 sessions, bilateral placement and high-density treatment (three times the seizure threshold) should be attempted before ECT is abandoned.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "A decrease in retrograde memory is a side effect of ECT that could persist even after the treatment course ends. Retrograde memory disturbances take 1-6 months to recover. Other cognitive side effects of ECT include: • Disorientation • Diminished processing speed • Decreased anterograde memory • Errors in visual-spatial function and word-finding. These effects are seen immediately after a treatment session and diminish fairly quickly after the treatment course ends.",

        "D": "It allows for focal stimulation of the cerebral cortex"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a brain stimulation method that allows for focal stimulation of the cerebral cortex. TMS works by inducing eddy currents in the brain cortex due to the application of rapidly changing magnetic fields. These currents bring about neuronal stimulation. Advantages of TMS over ECT: • TMS allows for focal stimulation of brain areas • It does not induce seizures, but an unintended seizure is a known risk of this procedure. Studies have shown TMS to be less effective than ECT.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is approved for monotherapy in resistant depression. It uses the property of magnetic fields to induce electrical activity in the brain. It is different from MRI, as an MRI just observes but rTMS produces changes in the activity of the brain. rTMS can be used in addition to antipsychotics to treat resistant schizophrenia. However, it is not used as monotherapy.",

        "D": "Swimming skills remain intact after the procedure"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) reduces symptoms associated with movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. It provides a dramatic response with respect to off time and dyskinesias. However, it does not improve features that fail to respond to levodopa and does not prevent the development or progression of non-dopaminergic features, such as freezing, falling, dementia, etc. It is an invasive procedure performed using MRI-guided stereotactic techniques, in which electrodes are implanted in the brain and are connected via a subcutaneous wire to a maximum of two neurostimulators, which are placed under the skin of the clavicle. Impaired swimming skills surfaced as an unexpected risk of the procedure; several Parkinson's disease patients lost their ability to swim after receiving deep brain stimulation.",

Anterior cingulotomy involves creating bilateral lesions in the anterior cingulate cortex under stereotactic guidance. Subcaudate tractotomy (capsulotomy) can also be used in the management of treatment-unresponsive OCD. Prefrontal lobotomy was introduced by Egas Moniz as a method of psychosurgery for treatment-resistant mental disorders, particularly major depressive disorder and OCD. Other indications for psychosurgery include: • Chronic and incapacitating schizophrenia with severe depression not responding to all modes of treatment. • Chronic and incapacitating anxiety disorder not responding to all modes of treatment.",

        "D": "Ongoing major upheaval in life"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "High frustration tolerance is favorable for psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis involves bringing repressed memories and feelings to the surface and resolving unconscious conflicts through understanding. Patient characteristics favorable for psychoanalysis: Significant suffering and a genuine wish to understand themselves. Ability to withstand frustration and anxiety that might emerge during analysis. A reasonable, mature superego that allows them to be honest with the analyst. Average intelligence. Psychologically minded, that is, being able to think abstractly and symbolically about the unconscious meanings of their behavior. Patient characteristics unfavorable for psychoanalysis: The absence of suffering and low motivation to understand. Inability to tolerate frustration and anxiety with poor impulse control. Extreme dishonesty or antisocial personality disorder. Low intelligence - inability to understand the process. Concrete thinking or the absence of psychological mindedness. Serious physical illness, an ongoing major upheaval in life like job loss or divorce.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "When a person reveals his feelings unconsciously by a slip of the tongue, it is known as parapraxis. Freud ascribed parapraxis to unconscious motives. Option B: Transference - A situation where the feelings, desires, and expectations of one person are redirected and applied to another person. Most commonly, transference occurs in a therapeutic setting, where a person in therapy unconsciously develops feelings towards the therapist. Option C: Repression - is a key concept of psychoanalysis, where it is understood as a defense mechanism. It ensures that what is unacceptable to the conscious mind - and would, if recalled, arouse anxiety - is prevented from entering into it. Option D: Displacement - Feelings that are connected with one person are displaced onto another person. E.g., a man who has had a bad day at the office, comes home and yells at his wife and children, is displacing his anger from the workplace onto his family. Catharsis: The expression of ideas, thoughts, and suppressed emotions by the patient, which provides a sense of relief. It is also known as ventilation. In catharsis, the patient reveals information voluntarily and consciously, whereas, in parapraxis, patient details are revealed unconsciously, by a slip of the tongue.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The patient believes 'if it has been true in the past, it's always going to be true', which is demonstrative of maladaptive assumption of temporal causality. Behavioral therapy techniques are used to test and change maladaptive and inaccurate cognitions. The overall purpose of such techniques is to help the patients understand the inaccuracy of their cognitive assumptions and learn new strategies and ways of dealing with issues. Cognitive Error: Overgeneralizing, Selective abstraction, Excessive responsibility (assuming personal causality), Assuming temporal causality (predicting without sufficient evidence), Self-references, Catastrophizing, Dichotomous thinking, Assumption: If it's true in one case, it applies to any case that is even slightly similar. The only events that matter are failures, deprivation, etc. One should measure self by errors, weaknesses, etc. I am responsible for all bad things, failures, etc. If it has been true in the past, it's always going to be true. I am the center of everyone's attention, especially my bad performances. I am the cause of misfortunes. Always think of the worst; it's most likely to happen to you.

      "explanation": "59The therapist first elicited the automatic thought the patient made, which is \"I do not fit anywherein this world\". The next step would be to test the validity of this automatic thought.Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is based on the psychological significance of the cognitivetriad:•· An individual's beliefs about themselves• Their personal world (including the people in their lives)• Their future.Problematic and biased interpretations related to this cognitive triad may lead to excessiveemotional distress.CBT is applied to identify these faulty ideas and beliefs, make the patient aware of the underlyingassumptions that drive them, and modifying their responses to them.The three components of cognitive therapy are:•Didactic aspects: Explaining to patients the cognitive triad, schemas, and faulty logic. Thetherapist must explain all the aspects of treatment.•Cognitive techniques: These involve four steps-Eliciting automatic thoughts - Asking the patient about the thought that causes the emotionalreaction in them.• Testing validity of the automatic thoughts• Identifying the general maladaptive assumptions (a belief that is false and rationallyunsupported)•Testing the validity of maladaptive assumptions•• Behavioral techniques like relaxation techniques and desensitization to the stimulus etc.CBT is used in the treatment of anxiety and panic disorders, depression, phobia, OCD, personalitydisorders, and somatoform disorders.",

Here, theperson overcomes anxiety elicited by a situation or an object by approaching the feared situationgradually and in a relaxed state.•Systematic desensitization consists of three steps:Relaxation training - patients attain a state of complete relaxation and are then exposed to thestimulus that elicits the anxiety response. The negative reaction of anxiety is inhibited by therelaxed state, a process called reciprocal inhibition.•Hierarchy construction - Patients and therapists prepare a graded list (or hierarchy) offear-provoking scenes in the order of increasing anxiety.• Desensitization of the stimulus - Patients proceed systematically through the list from the leastto the most anxiety-provoking scene while in a deeply relaxed state.Option A: Describes a patient with bulimia nervosa.Option C: Describes a patient with major depressive episode.Option D: Describes a patient with schizophreniform disorder.",
