      "explanation": "Aberrant language development and intellectual disability are not part of the core diagnosticcriteria for autism spectrum disorder, according to the DSM-5 update.Core diagnostic impairments in autism spectrum disorders according to DSM-5 are collapsed intotwo domains:1. Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts:• Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity•Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors (e.g. eye contact, body language, use of gestures,and facial expressions)• Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships (e.g. difficulties in sharing,imaginative play, or in making friends)2. Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, as manifested by at least twoof the following:• Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech (e.g. simple motorstereotypies, lining up toys or flipping objects, echolalia)325•Inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns and behavior (e.g. extreme distress atsmall changes, difficulties with transitions, rigid thinking patterns)• Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus (e.g, strongpreoccupation with unusual objects)• Hyper- or hypo-reactivity to sensory input (e.g., apparent indifference to pain/temperature,adverse response to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, visualfascination with lights or movement).",

The gene associated with Rett syndrome is the MECP-2 gene.It is an X-linked dominant condition. It is caused by mutations in the methyl-CpG binding protein2 or MECP2. This condition is extremely rare in males.Features of Rett Syndrome:•Apparently normal prenatal and perinatal period and apparently normal psychomotordevelopment through the first 5 months and normal head circumference at birth.• Deceleration of head growth between 5 months and 4 years and loss of acquired purposeful handskills between 5 and 30 months of age.• Severe impairment of expressive and receptive language, together with severe psychomotorretardation.326•Stereotyped midline hand movements (such as hand-wringing or \"hand-washing\") with an onsetat or after the time when purposeful hand movements are lost.",

It is characterized by asignificant developmental regression resulting in deterioration in behavioral and adaptivefunctioning including self-help skills with loss of language and social skills after a period ofnormal development for at least two years. It is also associated with features of dementia andsignificant intellectual disability.It is now included under autism spectrum disorder in the DSM-5 manual, and ICD-11 also.",
