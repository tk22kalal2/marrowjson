The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization. No psychotic episodes. E.

They are sometimes related to peakserum lithium levels.Dividing the dose of lithium carbonate and decreasing caffeine intake can decrease the severity ofthe tremors. In case of severe coarse tremors, lithium carbonate toxicity (serum lithium levelgreater than 2.5 mEq/L) must be ruled out.Options A and C: Carbamazepine and lamotrigine are off-label agents used for the management ofbipolar disorder, however, they do not cause tremors.Option B: Tremors may occur as an adverse effect of gabapentin, but it is not prescribed for themanagement of bipolar disorder.",
