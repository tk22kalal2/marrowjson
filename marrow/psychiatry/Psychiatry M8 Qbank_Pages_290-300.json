      "question": "A first-year psychiatry resident gets a call regarding one of his patients who has been broughtto the ER with high-grade fever and pharyngitis. The patient was started on clozapine twoweeks back for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. His oral examination reveals the followingpicture. What would be the appropriate management?290",

      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of high-grade fever and pharyngitis and the simultaneous developmentof oral ulcers (image) in a patient on clozapine is suggestive of drug-induced agranulocytosis. Thetreatment is to stop clozapine immediately, administer granulocyte colony-stimulating factor(G-CSF), and start empirical antibiotics.Agranulocytosis is a rare, but fatal complication of clozapine. It is defined as an absoluteneutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 500/mm3, or white blood cell (WBC) count &lt; 2000/mm3. It caninitially manifest as a local infection with high-grade fever, sore throat, oral and perianalulcerations.These symptoms appear rapidly within days to weeks following initiation of drug therapy.Clozapine is generally considered to be more effective than other antipsychotic drugs and is oftenused in treatment-resistant schizophrenia (poor treatment response to 2 or more antipsychoticdrugs). Hence, a switch from clozapine to another (less effective) antipsychotic drug is not done ina patient with drug-induced agranulocytosis.295",

        "D": "Tyramine is involved the pathogenesis of the condition."
      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of cheese reaction, not serotonin syndrome. Here, thepatient on phenelzine (non-selective and irreversible MAO-inhibitor) developed the clinicalfeatures of cheese reaction on having a tyramine-rich food item (red wine, cheese, milk).Inhibition of the MAO-A isoform prevents the metabolism of dietary tyramine in the gut, thusallowing intact tyramine to enter the systemic circulation. It is taken up by adrenergic neuronsand a hypertensive crisis occurs as a result of a powerful pressor effect of tyramine.The drug of choice to treat hypertensive crisis in cheese reaction is phentolamine.Cheese reactionCheeseRed wineBeerBananaTyramineDegradation in the gut inhibited by MAO-ITyramine accumulation in systemic circulationUptake by adrenergic neuronDisplacement of norepinephrine fromstorage vesicles by tyramineHypertensive crisisMARROWMAO-inhibitor with SSRI causes serotonin syndrome.

Haloperidol poses the highest risk for causing NMS. Thecondition may occur within 24-72 hrs after initiation of the treatment, and if untreated, may lastfor 10 to 14 days.Option A: Serotonin syndrome occurs due to an increase of plasma serotonin to toxic levels, dueto concurrent administration of SSRI and an MAO inhibitor, L-tryptophan or lithium.It is characterized by 3 A's:• Neuromuscular hyperactivity - clonus, hyperreflexia, hypertonia, tremor, and seizure• Autonomic stimulation - hyperthermia, diaphoresis, diarrhoea• Agitation.In severe cases, there may be delirium, coma, status epilepticus, and death.Option B: Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by abnormal, irregular, involuntary choreoathetoidmovements of the muscles of the head, limbs, and trunk. Perioral movement is most common.The condition usually develops as a delayed response to antipsychotics, about 6 months aftertreatment.Option C: Hypersensitivity reaction to haloperidol may include anaphylactic reaction,angioedema, facial and laryngeal oedema, rash, urticaria, bronchospasm, and laryngospasm.",
