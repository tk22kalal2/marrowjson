      "explanation": "175The use of illegal drugs or drug-related legal problems is not an exclusive criterion to diagnosesubstance use disorder under DSM-5.Substance use disorder can occur with legally available substances like alcohol, tobacco and someprescription drugs.Substance use disorder is defined as a maladaptive pattern of substance use leading to clinicallysignificant impairment. It is manifested by 2 or more out of 11 criteria occurring within a12-month period.•DSM-5 criteria for diagnosing substance use disorder:• Recurrent substance use resulting in failure to fulfill obligations at work, school, or home. e.g.,substance-related absences or expulsions from school.• Recurrent substance use even in physically hazardous situations e.g., driving an automobilewhen impaired by substance use.• Continued substance use despite having persistent social problems caused by the effects of thesubstance e.g., arguments with the spouse.• Continued substance use despite having a physical or psychological problem that is likely to havebeen caused by the substance.• The substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended.• Efforts are made to cut down or control substance use but are unsuccessful.• Tolerance - there is markedly diminished desired effect with continued use of the same amountof the substance, hence there is a need for increased amounts of the substance to achieveintoxication.•Withdrawal - developing characteristic withdrawal symptoms for the substance, which can berelieved by taking the same or closely related substance.•Craving or a strong desire or urge to use a specific substance.• A great deal of time is spent to obtain the substance, use the substance, or recover from itseffects.• Important activities are given up or reduced because of substance use.",

      "explanation": "When an individual requires a lesser dose of alcohol (drug) to obtain the same effect as before,this phenomenon is known as reverse tolerance.In alcoholics, it is a sign of late-stage alcoholism, where the patient has developed cirrhosis. Theliver doesn't produce enough enzymes like before to metabolize alcohol leading to increased bloodalcohol levels.Option A: Tachyphylaxis is the rapid development of tolerance when a drug is repeatedly used inquick succession, resulting in a marked reduction in response.Option B: Desensitization may be equivalent to drug tolerance and refers to a diminishedresponse/effect with continued use of the same dose of the substance.Option D: Cross-tolerance is a phenomenon that occurs when tolerance to the effects of one drugproduces tolerance to another drug. It often happens between two drugs with similarpharmacological actions. eg. alcohol and benzodiazepines (both are depressants).178Note: A quarter bottle is approximately 180 ml.",

      "explanation": "Disulfiram is a deterrent agent, not an anti-craving drug. It is an irreversible aldehydedehydrogenase inhibitor.Acetaldehyde is the first breakdown product of alcohol, which is further metabolized by aldehydedehydrogenase. If a patient who is on disulfiram consumes alcohol, it results in toxic levels ofacetaldehyde.This causes symptoms such as flushing, pulsating headache, nausea, vomiting, respiratorydifficulties, chest pain, and autonomic manifestations, collectively termed as disulfiram ethanolreaction (DER).Other deterrent agents include citrated calcium carbamide and metronidazole.Anti-craving drugs used in alcohol deaddiction include:• Baclofen•AcamprosateNaltrexone• Newer drugs are topiramate, SSRI and ondansetronAlcohol deaddiction treatment involves the following phases:1. Intervention - aimed at maximizing the motivation for treatment and continued abstinence.2. Detoxification - involves minimizing withdrawal symptoms.3. Rehabilitation and maintenance - includes three major components:• Continued efforts to increase and maintain high levels of motivation for abstinence• Work to help the patient readjust to a lifestyle free of alcohol•Relapse prevention",

Antipsychoticmedications may reduce the seizure threshold in these patients and should be avoided.The best treatment for delirium tremens is prevention. Patients withdrawing from alcohol whoexhibit withdrawal phenomena should receive benzodiazepines, such as 25 to 50 mg ofchlordiazepoxide every 2 to 4 hours until they seem to be out of danger.Once the delirium appears, 50 to 100 mg of chlordiazepoxide should be given every 4 hours orally,or lorazepam should be given intravenously (IV) if oral medication is not possible.A high-calorie, high-carbohydrate diet supplemented by multivitamins is also important.Carbohydrates increase the serotonin levels similar to alcohol, lowering the rates of withdrawalseizures.",

      "explanation": "180The given clinical scenario is suggestive of Marchiafava Bignami disease (MBD). It ischaracteristically associated with a 'sandwich' sign on MRI.MBD is a rare, idiopathic CNS disorder seen as a complication of chronic alcoholism. Earlysymptoms may include depression, paranoia, psychosis, or dementia. Seizures,hemiparesis, aphasia, and abnormal movements, and ataxia are also seen. If not promptlyidentified and treated may progress to coma and death.It is associated with central degeneration of corpus callosum, sparing the dorsal and ventral parts.This characteristic pattern of degeneration presents as the 'sandwich' sign, best visualized onsagittal MRI of the brain.Clinically, conditions such as Wernicke's encephalopathy, delirium tremens, or pontinedemyelination may have similar presentations and their features may overlap. Henceneuroimaging plays a significant role in the accurate diagnosis of MB disease.Ophthalmoplegia and involvement of mamillary bodies and medial thalamic nuclei are associatedwith Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, not MBD.The sagittal MRI image given below shows the characteristic 'sandwich' sign in MarchiafavaBignami disease.Apr 13 205:32:22",

Thiamine administration (100 mg IV or IM for 3 days followed by two to three times aday orally for 1 to 2 weeks) may reduce the risk of it progressing to chronic Korsakoff psychosiswhich is irreversible.Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is seen due to the deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1). Thiamine isa cofactor (TPP) in glucose metabolism. Thus, starting dextrose infusions before thiamineadministration will exacerbate the existing thiamine deficiency, precipitating Wernicke's disease.Thiamine is also involved in the conduction of the axon potential and synaptic transmission.181Alcohol abuse leads to thiamine deficiency by the following mechanisms:• Poor nutritional habits• Folate deficiency - reduces thiamine absorption from the gastrointestinal tract• Direct damage of the intestinal mucosaWernicke's encephalopathy/alcoholic encephalopathy is an acute neurological disordercharacterized by the clinical triad (GOA):• Global Confusion• Ophthalmoplegia ( first symptom to improve with thiamine +dextrose infusion)• Ataxia",
