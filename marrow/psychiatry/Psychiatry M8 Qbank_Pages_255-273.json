Dreams which occur during this state are usually lucid andpurposeful.•REM sleep is characterized by a high level of brain activity. The physiological activity is similar tothat during wakefulness. In REM sleep,Pulse, respiration, and blood pressure are increased.• Brain oxygen use increases during REM sleep.• Thermoregulation is altered - Poikilothermia prevails during REM sleep.• There is loss of muscle tone - body movements are absent during REM sleep.There is partial or full penile erection - This is used to evaluate the cause for impotence.• Dreams are abstract and surreal.In normal adults, a REM episode has a latency of about 90 minutes during which the sleep is inthe NREM stage.

      "explanation": "The history is suggestive of restless leg syndrome and gabapentin is the first-line choice oftreatment for this condition.Gabapentinoids are considered superior to dopamine agonists due to the high frequency ofintermediate and long-term augmentation with dopamine agonists, as well as their risk of impulse270control disorders.Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is an irresistible urge to move the legs when at rest or while tryingto fall asleep or an uncomfortable sensation of creeping-crawling feeling. It is worse at night andmoving legs or walking reduces discomfort. Uremia, neuropathies, as well as iron-deficiency andfolic acid-deficiency anemias can produce secondary RLS.In patients with restless legs syndrome, iron stores are initially repleted, and the aggravatingfactors are eliminated. If RLS still persists, initial therapy with a gabapentinoid (pregabalin,gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil) is preferred, rather than a dopamine agonist (pramipexole,ropinirole, rotigotine).FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of restless leg syndrome:• Gabapentin• Ropinirole• Pramipexole⚫ RotigotineNote: A dopamine agonist is used as an alternative in patients with increased risk for side effectsfrom gabapentinoids, such as those with obesity and its complications, a past or present history ofmoderate to severe depression, a disorder causing gait instability or respiratory failure, and ahistory of substance use disorder.",

It includes,• Continuous EEG recording, from occipital and parietal leads• Electro-oculography- to record eye movements• Electromyography- for muscle potential and its activities• ECG• Multiple sleep latency tests- repeated measures of time taken to sleep•Nasal-oral airflow, respiratory effort, oxyhemoglobin saturation, and leg movements duringsleep are measured.PolysomnographyREOGLEOGC3A2C4A1O1A2O2A1ChinEGG!Spoz0707 97 97 97 97 97 97 07 07 07 97 9796 CHO 06 06 07 07 07 97 0742 40 41 41 40 40CF46 45 45 #1 41 41 40 41 41 4141HRTDo10s159200255MSnoreTHOADDREOG, LEOGC3A2, C4A1,01A2, O2A1ChinECG1SpO2HRMSnoreTHOand ABDElectro-oculographyElectroencephalographyChin electromyographyElectrocardiographyPulse oximetryHeart rateOronasal airflowThoracic andAbdominal movements©MARROWEpworth sleep assessment scale is a questionnaire used to quantify daytime sleepiness.
