      "explanation": "Long-term memory is normal in Korsakoff syndrome. In Korsakoff syndrome, immediate recall is impaired but long-term memory is preserved. Korsakoff syndrome is a type of diencephalic amnesia, caused by chronic thiamine deficiency and alcohol abuse. Clinically, subjects with Korsakoff syndrome present with the following: • Severe anterograde amnesia - striking inability to form new memories • Impaired mental syndrome (especially recent memory) • Present with confabulation, as an attempt to cover the memory deficit • Retrograde amnesia is less severe, but present. • Implicit learning (e.g., learning procedures) are preserved • Overall intact intelligence",

      "explanation": "The symptoms of dementia (MMSE score of 20), diarrhea, and dermatitis in sun-exposed areas like the forehead, neck (Casal's necklace), and hands are seen in vitamin B3 (niacin) deficiency, also known as pellagra. The neuropsychiatric symptoms of pellagra include apathy, irritability, insomnia, depression, and delirium. Option A: Myxedema madness is a rare presentation of hypothyroidism characterized by depression, hypomania, and schizophrenia. Diarrhea and vomiting are usually not seen. Option C: Acute intermittent porphyria is characterized by periodic abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, psychotic features, tachycardia. There is no photosensitivity in acute intermittent porphyria. Option D: Thiamine deficiency can cause Wernicke's encephalopathy, which manifests as an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia, mental status changes, and unsteadiness of stance and gait, or can cause Korsakoff syndrome, which manifests as a chronic amnestic syndrome characterized by severe anterograde amnesia and confabulation.",

      "question": "A 20-year-old woman with no family history of psychiatric illness was referred to the psychiatry OPD from neurology for management of acute psychiatric disturbances. She had the following finding on slit-lamp examination and her 24-hour urinary copper was found to be elevated. Which of the following is a true statement regarding neuropsychiatric manifestations of this disease?",

        "D": "The most common form of progression is the choreatic form"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with elevated urinary copper and Kayser-Fleischer ring is seen in Wilson's disease. The tremor associated with Wilson's disease is called a wing-beating tremor, in which the arms beat in a wide, violent arc. This tremor is a high-amplitude tremor that is prominent with arms abducted, elbows flexed, and palms facing downward. It is characteristically absent at rest and develops after a short period of arm extension. In the majority of cases, neuropsychiatric manifestations follow hepatic manifestations. It is due to the deposition of free copper in the basal ganglia (bilateral degeneration) and cortex. The features include: Dysarthria (most common): irregular word spacing, hypophonic or spastic speech. Dystonia: vacuous smile, i.e., mask-like face with an open mouth. Parkinsonism: bradykinesia, postural instability, rigidity. Subcortical dementia: slow mental processing, memory loss. Psychiatric symptoms: loss of emotional control, depression, hyperactivity. Decreased scholastic performance: deterioration in handwriting, clumsiness. Autonomic symptoms: excessive sweating and salivation, sexual dysfunction.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The development of acute psychotic symptoms after intramuscular administration of penicillin G points to a diagnosis of Hoigne syndrome. It may also be seen after benzathine administration. Hoigne syndrome: Acute psychotic symptoms are seen, such as mental confusion, visual and auditory hallucinations, and perceived changes of body shape. The patient may also present with swelling of the tongue and a fear of impending death. These are usually embolic toxic reactions, possibly due to vascular occlusion by large crystals of the penicillin salts. It is due to a pseudoanaphylactic or pseudoallergic reaction, not penicillin allergy. A Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is a transient clinical phenomenon that occurs in patients infected with spirochetes, like syphilis, leptospirosis, Lyme disease, and relapsing fever, who are treated with antibiotics. The reaction occurs within 24 hours of antibiotic therapy. It generally manifests as fever, chills, rigors, nausea and vomiting, headache, tachycardia, hypotension, hyperventilation, flushing, myalgia, and exacerbation of skin lesions. It is an acute, self-limiting condition.",

        "D": "Alcohol-induced dementia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of disorientation with features of autonomic hyperactivity (tachycardia, diaphoresis, fever) in a patient who stopped alcohol 3 days back is suggestive of delirium tremens. Delirium tremens is the most severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome. It occurs usually within 3-4 days of alcohol withdrawal. Characteristic features are: clouding of consciousness with disorientation to time and place, poor attention and distractibility, visual hallucination and illusions which are often vivid and frightening. Autonomic disturbances like tachycardia, fever, hypertension, sweating, and pupillary dilatation, psychomotor agitation and ataxia. Benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide and lorazepam are used in the treatment and prevention of delirium tremens. Option A: Korsakoff's psychosis is characterized by impaired mental abilities (especially recent memory) and anterograde amnesia in an alert and responsive patient. The patient may have symptoms of confabulation. Option B: Wernicke's encephalopathy is characterized by ataxia (affecting primarily the gait), vestibular dysfunction, confusion, and ocular motility abnormalities. Option D: Alcohol-induced dementia is characterized by the development of multiple cognitive deficits (e.g., memory problems, language impairment, and an inability to perform complex motor tasks) that are judged to be a direct consequence of alcohol use. This persists beyond the usual duration of alcohol intoxication or acute withdrawal.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "PANDAS is associated with Streptococcus pyogenes infection. PANDAS stands for Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections. The symptoms occur usually abruptly and can include the following: • Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) • Tic disorder • Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (coprolalia and tics). In addition to these symptoms, children may become moody or irritable, experience anxiety attacks, or show concerns about separating from parents or loved ones. It has been hypothesized that in response to group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection, autoimmune antibodies are produced, which cross-react with brain tissue (molecular mimicry), leading to neuropsychiatric manifestations. Note: Non-infectious manifestations of streptococcal infection include: • Rheumatic Heart Disease • Glomerulonephritis • PANDAS • Guttate Psoriasis",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The above clinical scenario of severe unilateral headache associated with autonomic changes(rhinorrhea, lacrimation) is suggestive of cluster headache, which is a type of trigeminalautonomic cephalalgias (a group of primary headache disorders). The pain can be so intense thatthe patient may appear to be psychotic because of the screaming and thrashing associated withthe pain.75Characteristic features of cluster headache:• Unilateral, deep retro-orbital excruciating pain.•• Frequent intense attacks (often several per day) over a 1 to 2 month period, separated byheadache-free intervals for as long as 1 or 2 years.• Associated ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms (conjunctival injection, aural fullness,rhinorrhea, or nasal congestion) or cranial sympathetic activation(ptosis).• Patients tend to move about during attacks, rocking, or rubbing their heads for relief; some mayeven become aggressive during attacks. This is in sharp contrast to patients with migraines, whoprefer to remain motionless during attacks.Note: Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TAC) are a group of primary headache disorders thatare characterized by strictly unilateral trigeminal distribution pain associated with ipsilateralcranial autonomic symptoms, and include:• Cluster headache• SUNCT (short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection andtearing) SUNA (short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with cranial autonomicsymptoms)• Paroxysmal hemicrania (PH)• Hemicrania continua",
