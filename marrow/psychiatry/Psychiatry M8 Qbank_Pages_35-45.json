      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Mental Status Examination (MSE) is a structured way of observing and describing a patient's psychological functioning at a given point in time. It does not involve the scoring of a patient. The main components of MSE are: Appearance and behavior, Mood and affect, Speech, Thought process and content, Perceptual disturbances, Sensorium and cognition, Insight, and Judgment. When conducting the MSE or interpreting MSE findings, it is essential to consider the cultural background of both the clinician conducting the MSE and the interviewee because behavioral patterns vary significantly across cultures (e.g., nodding your head as a sign of approval in some countries might signify disagreement in others). Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), also known as Folstein's test, is done out of a score of 30 and is used to measure cognitive impairment. Note: Mental Status Examination (MSE) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) are two different assessment tests.",

It is used extensively in clinical and research settings to test cognitive functioning. A patient with a score less than 24 is considered to have impaired cognition.",

      "question": "A patient is brought to the OPD in a state of euphoria. He was smiling and talking softly when he came in, then he was quiet for a while. He then seemed to be excited and suddenly started to laugh for no reason. How should the psychiatrist record his mood and affect?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Elevated mood and excited affect",

Then the patient learns the three names, repeating until correct. ATTENTION AND CALCULATION · Subtract 7 from 100, then subtract 7 from the result, continue five times: 100, 93, 80, 70, 65. (Alternative: spell 'WORLD' backwards: DUROW). RECALL Ask for the names of the three objects learned earlier, LANGUAGE Name two objects (e.g., pen, watch). Repeat 'No ifs, ands, or buts'. Give a three-stage command, one point for each stage. (e.g., 'Place index finger of right hand on your nose and then on your left ear'). Ask the patient to read and obey a written command on a piece of paper. The written instruction is: 'Close your eyes'. Ask the patient to write a sentence. Score 1 if it is sensible and has a subject and a verb. COPYING: Ask the patient to copy a pair of intersecting pentagons. MMSE scoring 24-30 no cognitive impairment, 18-23: mild cognitive impairment, 0-17: severe cognitive impairment. In this scenario, the patient's mood is elevated because he seems to be euphoric and excited. His affect is labile because there is excessive variation in emotions without any apparent reason (from smiling one moment, to being quiet, then laughing). Mood is a pervasive and sustained emotional state experienced subjectively by the patient. It is not always readily observable. It can be characterized as follows: • Dysphoric - includes sustained emotional states such as sadness, anxiety, or irritability. • Elevated - an exaggerated feeling of well-being, euphoria, or elation. • Expansive - lack of restraint in expressing feelings, frequently with an over-valuation of one's significance or importance. • Irritable - easily annoyed or angered. • Euthymic - mood in the normal range. Affect is the cross-section of mood at a given point in time. It fluctuates with time and context. It can be observed by the clinician. It can be characterized as follows: • Quality (or tone) of a patient's affect includes being happy, irritable, angry, agitated, tearful, sobbing, and flat. • Quantity of affect is a measure of its intensity, e.g., mildly depressed or severely depressed. • Range can be restricted, normal, or labile. • Appropriateness is described in relation to the social situation. • Congruency is described in relation to the thought content of the person.",

In this situation, the man is speaking about his mother's death and is expected to be sad, but he is laughing. His laughter is not congruent with the content of his speech and thoughts. Option B: Labile affect denotes excessive variations in emotion without any apparent reason. For example, a person starts laughing and then crying for no reason. This is seen in mania. Option C: Affective flattening/flat affect is used to describe a severely restricted range of affect (absence of changes in emotion irrespective of the situation). It is seen in schizophrenia. Option D: Inappropriate affect denotes emotional responses that do not match with the social situation one is in. Appropriateness is described in relation to the social situation. For example, if a man is laughing at a funeral, he has an inappropriate affect.",

      "question": "A 24-year-old woman with epilepsy gets repeated thoughts to cut off her fingers with a knife. These thoughts are detailed and distressing but do not urge her to do the action or cause any anxiety. The thoughts last for 5-10 minutes, after which she gets a seizure; then the thoughts disappear and she feels better. What is this phenomenon called?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "In the above scenario, the patient has forced thinking. The thoughts formed are not in control of the patient and are distressing. Forced thinking is one of the recognized pre-ictal events (auras) occurring in focal epilepsy or more specifically, in frontal lobe epilepsy. It usually resolves after the episode of seizure. Pre-ictal events (auras) in complex partial epilepsy include: Automatisms (classical) - e.g., lip-smacking, rubbing, chewing. Cognitive sensations - e.g., deja vu, jamais vu, forced thinking, dreamy states. Autonomic sensations - e.g., fullness in the stomach, blushing, changes in respiration. Affective states - e.g., fear, panic, depression, elation. Option A: Obsessions are recurrent and persistent ideas, thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced as intrusive and unwanted and cause anxiety or distress to the patient. It is seen in obsessive-compulsive disorder. Option B: Thought crowding is characterized by too many thoughts occurring at the same time in the field of consciousness. It is perceived as unpleasant and induces the feeling that ideas are difficult to catch. It is seen in mood disorders such as hypomania and bipolar disorder. Option D: Thought insertion is a disorder of thought possession in which the patient feels that thoughts are being inserted into his mind by some external agent. It is seen in schizophrenia.",

      "explanation": "In the given scenario, test judgment is being assessed. Judgment is the ability to assess a situation, make good decisions, and act on them. Test judgment is assessed by asking the patient what he would do in hypothetical situations, such as a house on fire, or a man lying on the road, or a sealed, stamped, addressed envelope lying on a street. Social judgment is the ability to perceive social situations and act accordingly. The following are observed during the hospital stay and during the interview session: • Does the patient understand the likely outcome of personal behavior? • Subtle manifestations of behavior that are harmful to the patient. • Behavior that is not culturally acceptable. There is no category called response judgment.",
