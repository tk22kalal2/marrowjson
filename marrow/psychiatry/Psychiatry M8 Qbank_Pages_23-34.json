        "C": "Pseudohallucination",
        "D": "Delusion"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Delusion is a disturbance of thought content. Disorders of perception: -Illusion, an incorrect perception or misinterpretation of a sensory stimulus. Hallucination - perception in the absence of any stimulus. Depersonalization - feeling of being a detached observer of oneself. Derealization - feeling that one's environment has changed in some strange way that is difficult to describe. Pseudohallucination is neither a symptom nor a feature of any perception disorder. Hence, delusion is the best answer among the given options. True hallucination arises from external objective space (voices heard in one's ears arising from the outside world) and cannot be recognized as unreal. Pseudohallucination arises from inner subjective space (voices from within one's own mind) and can be recognized as unreal.",

      "question": "A girl wakes the entire hostel dormitory, screaming about a snake in the bathroom. Thematron rushes in and sees her pointing at a rope. Which of the following best describes this?",

        "C": "Delusion",
        "D": "Pseudohallucination"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "In the above scenario, a rope being mistaken for a snake is an illusion. Illusions are perceptions that occur when a sensory stimulus is present but is incorrectly perceived and misinterpreted. Delusion: a fixed false belief that is firmly held despite obvious contradictory evidence and that is not consistent with the person's social, educational, and cultural background. Hallucination: perception in the absence of any external sensory stimulus. Illusion: incorrect perception or misinterpretation of a sensory stimulus. Delusion, e.g., a belief that the person is a snake god. Hallucination, e.g., there is nothing in front of you, but you can see a snake. Illusion, e.g., there is a rope in front of you, but you see it as a snake.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Originates from the inner subjective space",
        "B": "Cannot be recognised as unreal",

        "D": "May be vivid and clear"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Pseudohallucinations can be recognized as unreal. A pseudohallucination is an example of false perception heard within one's own mind (inner subjective space) rather than perceived as coming from the outside world (outer objective space). They lack the substantiality of perceptions, are seen in full consciousness, and can be recognized as unreal even though they are clear and vivid. Like true hallucinations, these are involuntary and cannot be produced at will. The presence of pseudohallucinations does not necessarily indicate psychopathology, unlike true hallucinations, which are indicative of mental illness. True hallucination arises from external objective space (voices heard in one's ears arising from the outside world), cannot be recognized as unreal. Pseudohallucination arises from inner subjective space (voices from within one's own mind), can be recognized as unreal.",

      "question": "A 38-year-old woman complained of an ongoing vibrating sensation in her genitalia caused by her mother opening and shutting doors. Which of the following terms best describes her symptoms?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Functional hallucination.",
        "B": "Reflex hallucination",
        "C": "Panoramic hallucination",
        "D": "Pseudohallucination"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The patient is experiencing reflex hallucinations. In this scenario, a sensory stimulus in one modality (auditory) is resulting in a sensory experience in a different modality (vibratory). Option A: Functional hallucinations are triggered by a stimulus in the same modality, and co-occur with it. E.g., a patient may report that he hears voices criticizing him (auditory hallucination) every time he hears the sound of a rotating fan (auditory stimulus), which stops when the fan is not running. Option C: Panoramic hallucination is a compound hallucination in which the entire sensory input is replaced by hallucinatory perceptions, thus giving rise to a totally different perceptual reality. Option D: Pseudohallucination is a false perception heard within one's own mind (inner subjective space) rather than perceived as coming from the outside world (outer objective space), and is recognized as unreal. Other special types of hallucinations: Hypnogogic hallucination - occurs prior to falling asleep (HypnoGogic: Going to sleep). Hypnopompic hallucination - occurs prior to waking up. Extracampine hallucination - experienced outside the limits of one's sensory field. E.g., a patient in Delhi hearing voices from Chennai.",

      "explanation": "Perceptual distortion of shape, size, color, and reciprocal position of objects is known as Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS). It is seen in schizophrenia and migraine. AIWS may be secondary to seizures associated with an arteriovenous malformation. Alice in Wonderland syndrome is characterized by perceptual distortion of shape, size, color, and reciprocal position of objects. Option A: Kleine-Levin syndrome is characterized by hypersomnia, hyperphagia, and hypersexuality. Option B: Kanner syndrome is characterized by the failure to develop an attachment with a parental figure and a preoccupation with inanimate objects. Option D: Pickwickian syndrome is sleep apnea associated with hypersomnia, in elderly and obese persons.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In the above scenario, the patient is exhibiting neologism. Neologism is a disorder of the form of thought. This refers to making new words (gooder, gerkschier) that do not exist and using them meaninglessly. It is usually seen in schizophrenia.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "In the clinical scenario, thoughts of being followed and harmed by people represent a delusion of persecution. It is the most common type of delusion. A delusion is a false, firm, fixed (unshakable) belief that is not in keeping with the patient's socio-cultural and educational background. They are of two types based on their origin: Primary - arise de novo and cannot be explained based on previous experiences, characteristic of schizophrenia. Secondary - delusions that are secondary to other morbid psychological conditions like depressive moods and hallucinations.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Ambivalence is the inability to decide for or against, due to the co-existence of two opposing impulses for the same thing, at the same time, in the same person. Ambivalence is an important feature of schizophrenia. It is also seen with OCD and other borderline conditions. Option A: Abulia is an inability to make a decision generally. Unlike ambivalence, there are no opposing impulses present. Option C: Anhedonia is a loss of pleasure in previously pleasurable activities. Option D: Alexithymia is an inability to recognize and describe feelings.",

This is a defect in memory that manifests as an unintentional filling of gaps in one's memory with words and content that are not true. It is mainly seen in alcoholism (Korsakoff psychosis), syphilis, senile dementia, and schizophrenia. Option A: Hallucination is a false perception without an external stimulus. Option C: Delusion is a fixed false belief that is firmly held despite obvious contradictory evidence and that is not consistent with the person's social, educational, and cultural background.

      "explanation": "When the person gives a wrong answer to a question, but it is very similar to the actual answer, it is called Vorbeireden, which means to give 'approximate answers'. Here, the person answered 'green' for the colour of the sky. The content of the reply shows that they have understood the nature of the question, but responded wrongly or approximately by talking about an associated topic. Vorbeireden is a feature of Ganser syndrome (hysterical pseudodementia), commonly found in prison inmates. Option A: Neologism refers to making new words that do not exist and using them meaninglessly, as seen in schizophrenia. e.g., 'The world is not 'gooder' for people like me'. Option B: Verbigeration is the meaningless and stereotyped repetition of words or phrases, seen in schizophrenia. e.g., 'I want to go home, go home, go home'. Option D: Circumstantiality is the inclusion of irrelevant details and talking in a roundabout manner, but the patient's thought ultimately reaches the answer.",

The resistance is directlyproportional to the force applied. Also called oppositional paratonia.• Mannerism- repetition of normal movements but inappropriately. They are purposeful. E.g.,repeatedly saluting the people around.•Stereotypy repetitive, odd, purposeless movements. E.g., making strange movements of fingersrepeatedly.• Automatic obedience- commands are followed automatically, irrespective of their nature.34",
