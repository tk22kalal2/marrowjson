Metformin effect is mainly mediated through activation of AMPK andaltering the energy dynamics at mitochondrial respiration.Option A - The reduction in glucose absorption can also occur but the contribution to theantihyperglycemic action is not significantOption B - Metformin increases peripheral glucose utilization by both insulin-dependent (reducinginsulin resistance) and independent ways. But the current evidence does not support thereduction in insulin resistance as the primary mechanism of metformin's action.Option D - Recent evidence shows blunting of glucagon effects as one of the mechanisms ofmetformin's actionNote: All are mechanisms of metformin, however, the key action is Option C and it is the mostappropriate answer.",

Metformin dose should bereduced when the eGFR is less than 45 ml/min/1.73 m2.Metformin is excreted by the kidneys, and accumulation with reduced kidney function mayincrease the risk of lactic acidosis (due to inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis).

It is not avoided in all cardiovascular diseases.Option A Pioglitazone is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8.-Option B - Pioglitazone is a selective agonist of nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor(PPAR). It modulates the expression of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism, insulinsignal transduction and adipocyte differentiation. These effects increase the sensitivity of thetissues to insulin.Option C - Pioglitazone does not increase insulin levels in the body. It sensitizes the tissues to theaction of insulin. Hence, insulin is needed for the action of pioglitazone. However, it does notneed insulin to modulate the expression of genes.",
