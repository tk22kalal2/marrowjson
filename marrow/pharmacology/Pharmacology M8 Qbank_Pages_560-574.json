      "explanation": "The most effective drug against extracellular mycobacteria is Rifampicin.567Option A: Isoniazid and Rifampicin act against both intracellular andextracellular mycobacterium.

It is a bacteriostatic drug. Fast-multiplying bacteria are highly susceptible to itsaction.Note: Streptomycin is primarily active against only the extracellular tubercle bacilli as itspenetration into the cells is very poor.",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Isoniazid is the first-line antitubercular drug that acts by inhibiting the synthesis of mycolic acid.Isoniazid is a first-line bactericidal drug that is used for the treatment of tuberculosis. This drugenters bacilli by passive diffusion. It then gets activated to its toxic form by the enzymecatalase-peroxidase(the enzyme encoded by the Kat gene).Normally, InhA and KasA are involved in the synthesis of mycolic acid. Upon activation, thereactive metabolite of isoniazid forms complexes with NAD that inhibit InhA and KasA. Hence,isoniazid inhibits the production of mycolic acid.The reactive isoniazid metabolite also forms complexes with NADP. This complex inhibitsmycobacterial dihydrofolate reductase which results in the interruption of DNA synthesis.Side effects of isoniazid include:• Peripheral neuritis due to interference with the production of active coenzyme pyridoxalphosphate from pyridoxine. Therefore, pyridoxine 10mg/day (vitamin B6) is given prophylacticallyalong with isoniazid to prevent neurotoxicity.•Hepatitis - isoniazid must be stopped at the first sign of hepatotoxicity.• Rashes• Anaemia• ArthralgiaToxicity of isoniazid results in metabolic acidosis, seizures, and coma.Other options:Option B: Rifampin acts by binding to DNA-dependent RNA polymerase to form a stabledrug-enzyme complex. This complex suppresses RNA synthesis. Side effects of rifampin arehepatitis, flu-like illness, orange-red colored urine, and body secretions.Option C: Pyrazinamide is a prodrug, it is converted into an active metabolite pyrazinoic acidwhich makes the intracellular environment acidic and collapses the transmembrane protonmotive force, thereby killing the bacteria. Side effects include hyperuricemia and hepatotoxicity.Option D: Ethambutol inhibits arabinose transferase III, thereby decreasing arabinogalactanbiosynthesis. This results in disruption in mycobacterial cell wall synthesis. Optic neuritis is an568important side effect of ethambutol. It results in decreased visual acuity and loss of red-greendiscrimination.",

      "explanation": "Isoniazid, a key agent in the ATT, is metabolized primarily through N-acetylation by thegenetically polymorphic N-acetyltransferase-2 (NAT2) enzyme. Slow acetylators (group A) ofisoniazid are prone to develop peripheral neuropathy.The rate of metabolism of isoniazid is determined by the genetic polymorphism of NAT2 enzymeand classified broadly into two groups - slow and fast acetylators.In slow acetylators, the drug accumulates due to slow metabolism resulting in an increased riskof side effects, and hence they should undergo periodic monitoring. Peripheral neuropathy is amore frequent side effect of INH when compared to hepatotoxicity.Fast acetylators metabolize the drug rapidly and show less response to standard doses and thetherapy may be less effective.",
