      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Heteroresistance occurs when a subset of the total microbial population is resistant, despite thetotal microbial population being susceptible on testing. The resistant subpopulation is usually wellbelow the assay-detection limits.Heteroresistant Staphylococci and M. tuberculosis have led to therapeutic failures and mortality.C. albicans and C. neoformans with heteroresistance to fluconazole have resulted in increasedtreatment failures.Note: For viruses, the resistant viral species occurring due to the above phenomenon is termed as'quasi-species'. Quasi-species resistant to antiretroviral agents have resulted in the failure ofantiretroviral therapy.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Aminoglycosides exhibit concentration-dependent killing and are preferably dosed once daily formaximum effect.Peak concentration above MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) matters for certain classes ofdrugs for their antimicrobial action. It is referred to as concentration-dependent killing. Theperiod during which the concentration remains above MIC is not relevant for such drugs.Aminoglycosides and quinolones have this property.Time-dependent killing: The antimicrobial action is dependent on the period for which theconcentration of drug remains above the MIC. Penicillins, 5-fluorocytosine and vancomycin havethis property.",

The main mode of transfer ofresistant gene-containing plasmids is through conjugation.",

      "explanation": "Nitrofurantoin is an antibacterial drug that does not act by inhibiting cell wall synthesis.The antibacterial activity of nitrofurantoin appears to correlate with the rapid intracellularconversion of nitrofurantoin to highly reactive intermediates by bacterial reductases. Theseintermediates react nonspecifically with many ribosomal proteins and disrupt the synthesis ofproteins, RNA, DNA, and metabolic processes.Carbapenems, monobactams, and cephalosporins are beta-lactam antibiotics that act by inhibitingcell wall synthesis.",
