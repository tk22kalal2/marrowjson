      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "707Thromboxane A2 is a pro-aggregatory eicosanoid whose formation requires the activity of COXenzyme. Aspirin blocks this step, thus reducing the chances of clot formation.Thromboxane A2 is an inducer of platelet aggregation and amplifies the signal of more potentplatelet agonists, such as thrombin and ADP.",

PGI2 analogs used for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension are:• Epoprostenol (IV)• Iloprost (IV)• Treprostinil (IV or SC)PGI2 (Epoprostenol) can also be used to prevent platelet aggregation and damage duringhaemodialysis or cardiopulmonary bypass.

        "A": "It is an irreversible inhibitor of the cyclooxygenase enzyme.",
        "B": "Its clearance is independent of plasma concentration at low dose.",

        "D": "Its antiplatelet effect at low dose is related to presystemic COX inhibition."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Aspirin clearance is dependent on plasma concentration at a lower dose.Aspirin shows saturation kinetics. This means that at lower plasma concentrations it hasfirst-order kinetics where the rate of elimination is proportional to the plasma708concentration but at higher plasma concentrations it has zero-order kinetics where the rate ofelimination is independent of its plasma concentration.Around 80-90% of aspirin (salicylates) are bound to plasma proteins, especially albumin.Low dose aspirin acetylates the COX enzyme of platelets in the portal circulation (pre-systemic)and deactivates it which is responsible for antiplatelet action.Aspirin and salicylates are acidic in nature. Alkalinization of the urine increases the rate ofexcretion of aspirin, as ionised form of aspirin increases which is not reabsorbed from the tubularfluid in kidney.",

      "explanation": "Piroxicam is chosen as it has the longest plasma half-life among NSAIDS.Piroxicam is absorbed completely and undergoes enterohepatic circulation. Due to the longhalf-life, once-daily administration of the drug is sufficient for the therapeutic response.",

        "A": "It causes renal toxicity",

        "D": "It has antiplatelet action"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Celecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor. As COX-2 enzyme is constitutively active within thekidney, recommended doses of selective COX-2 inhibitors cause renal toxicities similar to thoseassociated with traditional NSAIDs.Option B - It is less likely to cause gastric ulcers. Celecoxib has analgesic, antipyretic, andanti-inflammatory effects similar to those of non-selective NSAIDs but with better gastrointestinaltolerability.Option C - It inhibits COX-2-mediated prostacyclin synthesis in the vascular endothelium. As aresult, use of celecoxib is associated with increased cardiovascular risk.709Option D - Celecoxib at usual doses does not inhibit platelet aggregation. This is because plateletaggregation is mediated by thromboxane produced by the COX-1.These points are also true for other selective COX-2 inhibitors.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Celecoxib has the least COX-2 selectivity among the following.Some selective COX-2 inhibitors are withdrawn or have restricted use because of an increase inthe risk of cardiovascular events like myocardial infarction, serious skin reactions (valdecoxib),fatal hepatic failure (lumiracoxib).Nowadays, dual inhibitors inhibiting 5-LOX and COX like licofelone and tepoxalin are also usedfor their anti-inflammatory property.",

      "explanation": "Acetaminophen does not antagonize effects of uricosuric agents. It may be used concomitantlywith probenecid in the treatment of gout as it does not have any effect on uric acid levels.Option A - Acetaminophen has analgesic and antipyretic action equivalent to aspirin but lacks asignificant anti-inflammatory effect.Option B Acetaminophen toxicity causes centrilobular necrosis.--Option D It is a weak inhibitor of both COX-1 and COX-2 and has minimal or no effect onplatelet activity.",

        "D": "Nothing as she is asymptomatic"
      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The patient in the given clinical scenario has ingested a potentially toxic dose of acetaminophen.N-acetylcysteine is considered as a definitive antidote for acetaminophen poisoning to preventhepatic injury.N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) is a toxic metabolite of acetaminophen which causeshepatotoxicity. In adults, hepatotoxicity may occur after ingestion of a single dose of 10-15 g(150-250 mg/kg) of acetaminophen; doses of 20–25 g or more are potentially fatal.710In acetaminophen poisoning, due to increased NAPQI, there is utilization of glutathione (GSH).This in turn leads to depletion of GSH leading to oxidative cellular damage of thehepatocytes. N-acetylcysteine replenishes GSH stores and also conjugates with NAPQI andprevents oxidative damage to the cell. It also protects against extrahepatic injury due to itsantioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.Option A: Flumazenil is an antidote for benzodiazepine toxicity.Option C: Methylene blue is used in methemoglobinemia.Option D: Symptoms may take upto 2 days to develop in a case of acetaminophen poisoning bywhich time the hepatic damage may become irreversible.

      "explanation": "Piroxicam is a reversible inhibitor of cyclooxygenase enzyme and cannot be considered as a hitand run drug.Hit and run drugs are a group of drugs whose half-life is short, but cause irreversible inhibition ofa particular enzyme.

Theyoccur in lips, hands, legs, face, genitalia, and oral mucosa, and cause a burning sensation. Thelesion recurs in the same locations upon re-exposure to the offending drug.Some of the drugs commonly known to cause fixed drug eruptions are Sulphonamides, NSAIDs,Analgesics, and Hypnotics.Diagnosis is based on history and lesion morphology. Discontinuation of the offending drug is thefirst step in management.Phenytoin and carbamazepine can lead to Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermalnecrolysis (TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome).712",
