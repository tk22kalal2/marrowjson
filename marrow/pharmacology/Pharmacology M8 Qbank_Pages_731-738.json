You wish toprescribe a second-generation drug as they cause fewer side effects. Which of the followingwill you not choose?a) Olopatidineb) Loratidine",
        "C": "Cetrizine",
        "D": "Clemastine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "H3 receptor agonist decreases H2 mediated gastric secretion.H3 receptors are presynaptic inhibitory autoreceptors on histaminergic neurons. H3 receptoragonists decrease the release of histamine and have actions similar to that of antihistamines.Normally, histamine increases gastric secretion by acting through the H2 receptor in the stomach.H3 receptor agonist decreases histamine release and hence, decreasesH2 receptor-mediated gastric secretion.Options A and C: H1 receptor stimulation by histamine in the CNS causes wakefulness, and atthe bronchus causes bronchoconstriction. Therefore H3 receptor agonists by decreasing histaminerelease inhibit H1 receptor-induced wakefulness and bronchoconstriction.Option D: H3 receptors are also presynaptic heteroreceptors on various neurons and theiractivation can decrease noradrenergic, serotoninergic, cholinergic and glutaminergictransmission. A decrease in noradrenergic transmission in atria can result in a negativechronotropic effect.",

      "explanation": "The truck driver is suffering from allergic rhinitis and fexofenadine can be prescribed to him. Thisis preferred as it is a second-generation antihistamine having minimal/no sedative effects as itcannot cross the blood-brain barrier easily.Pheniramine, promethazine, and hydroxyzine are first-generation antihistamines which shouldnot be prescribed to drivers and heavy machine workers because they are lipophilic and cross theblood-brain barrier easily and cause sedation.•Highly sedative first-generation antihistamines:Diphenhydramine•Dimenhydrinate•Promethazine• Hydroxyzine",

      "explanation": "The scenario points towards a diagnosis of drug-induced Parkinsonism due to long-term intake ofhaloperidol. Promethazine is the preferred antihistamine as it has the strongestanticholinergic (muscarinic blocking) activity among the given options.Drug-induced Parkinsonism is caused by drugs that have D2 dopamine antagonistic action liketypical antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol). The decrease in dopaminergic activity results in anunbalanced cholinergic activity. Anticholinergics act by restoring balance.First-generation H1 antagonists have anticholinergic properties, while second-generation H1antagonists do not have anticholinergic properties.Hi antagonists having high anticholinergic activity are as follows:• Promethazine• Diphenhydramine•Dimenhydrinate•⚫ Pheniramine",

They have good topical activity.736Intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) remain the preferred monotherapy for persistent allergic rhinitis(AR). However, additional studies support the additive benefit of combination treatment withINCS and intranasal antihistamines in AR. For patients receiving INCS, an intranasaldecongestant may be added to the treatment for upto 4 weeks.",
