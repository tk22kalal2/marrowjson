This causes changes in body fat distribution. Type 2 diabetesmellitus has also been reported. This is called HIV/HAART-associated lipodystrophy.Indinavir can also precipitate in the urinary tract, causing nephrolithiasis, unless the patient ismaintained in a high state of hydration.Indinavir binds to the site of HIV-1 protease activity and inhibits cleavage of viral gag-polpolyprotein precursors into individual functional proteins required for infectious HIV. This resultsin the formation of immature, non-infectious viral particles.Option A: Azidothymidine or zidovudine, is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Chroniczidovudine administration has been associated with nail hyperpigmentation.Option C: Ketoconazole is an antifungal agent that inhibits fungal ergosterol synthesis.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Ibalizumab is an anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody approved for use in the treatmentof multidrug-resistant HIV-1. It is administered intravenously.486It acts as an entry inhibitor. It blocks HIV-1 from infecting CD4+ T cells by binding to domain 2 ofCD4 cells. It also interferes with post-attachment steps required for the entry of HIV-1 virusparticles into host cells and thus prevents the viral transmission that occurs via cell-cell fusion.",

      "question": "Which of the following is an integrase inhibitor indicated in the treatment of patients withHIV?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Lopinavir",
        "B": "Abacavir",
        "C": "Raltegravir",
        "D": "Ritonavir"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The integrase inhibitor indicated in the treatment of HIV is raltegravir.It inhibits the catalytic activity of the HIV-encoded integrase and prevents the integration of virusDNA into the host chromosome. It is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation by UGT1A1.The other two FDA-approved integrase inhibitors are elvitegravir (EVG) and dolutegravir (DTG).Options A and D: Lopinavir and ritonavir are protease inhibitors.Option B: Abacavir is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor.Note: Dolutegravir (DTG) is recommended as the preferred third drug for HIV post-exposureprophylaxis as per the recent MOHFW Jan 2020 guideline, in line with WHO.The FDA approved dolutegravir tablets and suspension for the treatment of HIV-1 infection inpediatric patients at least four weeks old and weighing at least 3 kg who have never been treatedfor HIV or who have been treated, but not with an integrase inhibitor class of drug.WHO recently recommended long-acting Cabotegravir, an HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitormay be offered as a HIV prevention option for people at substantial risk of HIV infection. It is anIM injectable form of pre-exposure prophylaxis that has been shown to be highly effective atreducing the risk of HIV acquisition. The first 2 injections were administered 4 weeks apart,followed thereafter by an injection every 8 weeks.487",
