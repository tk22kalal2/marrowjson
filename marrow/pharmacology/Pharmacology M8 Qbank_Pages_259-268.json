      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine. These are allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor. They donot directly activate GABAA receptors to open the Cl- channel.GABAA receptor is a transmembrane inhibitory receptor in the CNS that functions as a chlorideion channel and has 5 subunits.Benzodiazepines are allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor that bind at the ° /y interface ofthe receptor. This increases the affinity of the GABAA receptor for GABA thus increasing the263frequency of the opening of the channel.Barbiturates, on the other hand, have a different binding site to the receptor and they increase theduration of the GABA gated chloride channel opening.",

Nordazepam is further converted to oxazepam which isconjugated with glucuronic acid to form inactive metabolites.Lorazepam, oxazepam, and triazolam are also metabolized in the liver but do not form long-actingactive metabolites. As such, they can be used in elderly patients with liver disease but withcaution.Oxazepam and lorazepam are intermediate-acting and undergo glucuronide conjugation directlyto form inactive metabolites.Triazolam is a short acting benzodiazepine.
