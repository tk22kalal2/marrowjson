      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "L-asparaginase causes a hypercoagulable state. It is an enzyme and toxicity results due to theinhibition of protein synthesis in normal tissues.Side effects of L-asparaginase:••Thrombosis and increased coagulation - physiological anticlotting factors are impaired•Hemorrhage and bleeding - clotting factors are impaired• Hyperglycemia - insulin deficiency.869",
