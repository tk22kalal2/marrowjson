      "explanation": "The targets for the action of ß-lactam antibiotics are collectively termed penicillin-bindingproteins (PBPs) and they are not involved in protein synthesis.Transpeptidase enzyme and related proteins constitute the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)which are present in the bacterial cell membrane. Transpepetidase is involved in the synthesis ofpeptidoglycan of the bacterial cell wall. All ß-lactam groups of antibiotics bind to PBPs and inhibitthe last step in peptidoglycan synthesis.494Mutation in the different PBPs confers resistance to the bacteria against the beta-lactams.Methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) occurs due to alteration in the PBPS.Imipenem targets the PBPS, disrupting cell wall synthesis and causing death of themicro-organism.Beta-lactam group of antibiotics include:• Penicillins• Cephalosporins•Carbapenems• Monobactam",
