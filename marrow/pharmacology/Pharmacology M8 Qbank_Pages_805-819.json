      "explanation": "Ranitidine increases the gastric pH (i.e. less acidic) which reduces sucralfate efficacy; hence thecombination is incorrect.Polymerization of sucralfate occurs only at an acidic pH by crosslinking of the molecules whichforms a sticky gel-like consistency. This adheres to the ulcer base predominantly and remainsthere for almost 6 hours, preventing the ulcer base from coming in contact with the acid.Concurrent use of H2 blockers like ranitidine increases the gastric pH and thus hinders thepolymerization and reduces the efficacy of sucralfate.Sucralfate should be taken at least 2 hours after the administration of any other drug.",
