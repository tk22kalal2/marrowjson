      "explanation": "The clinical features given are suggestive of acute mania in this patient and lamotrigine is notindicated in this condition.It requires a slow, extended titration to minimize the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and isused for maintenance therapy in bipolar disorder.Lithium, sodium valproate, carbamazepine, and atypical antipsychotics are indicated in acutemania.Lithium is indicated in both acute mania and maintenance therapy.",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Prolonged use of lithium causes a benign and reversible flattening of T-wave.Option A: Lithium is usually not given alone in acute episodes as the onset of antimanic action isslow. Benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, or atypical antipsychotics are administered along withlithium in the early phases of treatment.Option B: Lithium has a very narrow therapeutic index and monitoring of serum concentration isused for guiding dose adjustment.Option D: Lithium causes significant weight gain.",

      "explanation": "Thiazides are contraindicated in patients who are on lithium therapy.Thiazide diuretics cause significant reductions in Li+ clearance that result in toxic levels.324The K+ sparing diuretics have modest effects on lithium excretion, with a mild increase in serumlevels.Loop diuretics have a limited impact on Li+ serum levels.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Clinical features are suggestive of lithium toxicity, where serum levels &gt;1.5 mEq/L areconsidered toxic.Lithium has a narrow therapeutic index (0.8-1.2 mEq/L) and therefore requires monitoring tosuspect toxicity. The toxic effects of lithium usually start manifesting when the serum level crosses1.5 mEq/L.Acute intoxication is characterized by:•Vomiting•Profuse diarrhea• Coarse tremors• Ataxia•Coma• Convulsions.A fine action tremor is common in patients taking lithium at therapeutic doses and can develop atany time during treatment. Therapeutic lithium tremor is generally symmetric, limited to thearms, and nonprogressive. Tremor from lithium toxicity is coarser and more disabling, may alsoaffect the legs, and occurs with other symptoms of toxicity.Serious effects of lithium toxicity will involve confusion, hyperreflexia, and seizures. Motor andcognitive side effects can become irreversible with persistent cerebellar tremor being the mostcommon.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In acute mania, even in patients without overt psychotic manifestations, atypical antipsychoticslike olanzapine is used initially for rapid control of psychosis. Atypical antipsychotics are alsoeffective as monotherapy.The therapeutic effects of lithium, carbamazepine, and valproic acid are seen only after a fewdays. Therefore they are effective only with daily dosing with adequate serum monitoring.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The clinical features given in the question are most likely suggestive of lithium toxicity, and henceserum lithium levels should be measured to confirm it.Lithium is a mood stabilizer with a very narrow therapeutic index and is the first line ofmanagement in bipolar disorder.The kidney handles both lithium and Na+ in the same way via ENac channel. Thus duringfasting/dehydration, along with Na+ reabsorption in renal tubules, there will be an increase inthe reabsorption of lithium leading to lithium toxicity.Lithium has a very narrow therapeutic index of 0.8-1.2 mEq/L. The severity of lithium toxicity isoften divided into the following three grades:A fine tremor is common in patients taking lithium at therapeutic doses. Therapeutic lithiumtremor is generally symmetric, limited to the arms, and nonprogressive. The tremor from lithiumtoxicity is coarser and more disabling, may also affect the legs, and occurs with other symptoms oftoxicity. Other adverse effects include mental confusion, hypothyroidism, nephrogenic diabetesinsipidus, and edema.As lithium is readily dialyzed, lithium overdose or toxicity is treated with hemodialysis.*Note - Serum Na+ levels are significant with respect to lithium toxicity, where as serumpotassium levels becomes significant in digoxin toxicity. Hypokalemia increases the risk ofdigoxin toxicity.GradeSr. lithium concentration(inmEq/L)SymptomsMild symptoms1.5-2.5Moderate intoxicatio2.5-3.5nnausea, vomiting, tremor, andfatigueconfusion, agitation, delirium,tachycardia, and hypertoniaSevere intoxication >3.5coma,seizures, hyperthermia,and hypotension",
