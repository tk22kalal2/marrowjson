It inhibits the synthesis of cortisol by inhibiting steroid 11 ẞ-hydroxylasereversibly.Cushing's syndrome (CS) is a manifestation of symptoms that are precipitated by excessivecortisol production. Transsphenoidal surgery, radiation, and pharmacotherapy constitute thestandard treatment for tumor-related causes of CS (e.g. pituitary adenoma).The three main pharmacological approaches are:•Cortisol synthesis inhibitors: Ketoconazole, metyrapone, mitotane, etomidate,aminoglutethimide⚫ ACTH secretion inhibitors: Cyproheptadine, pasireotide, octreotide, cabergoline•Glucocorticoid receptor antagonist: MifepristoneNote: Metyrapone is also used to test the hypothalamic-pituitary feedback pathway in thediagnosis of Cushing syndrome.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "\"A\" here corresponds to 11-beta-HSD2 (11ẞ-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase2). It converts activecortisol to inactive cortisone.Cortisol is active and can bind to both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoid receptors whereascortisone is inactive and does not bind to either. The selective inactivation of cortisol is requiredin certain sites such as the distal nephron so that the specific autoregulatory responses toaldosterone can be achieved.Therefore, cortisol (active) is metabolized to cortisone (inactive) by 11-beta-HSD2 in the kidney, soas to protect renal mineralocorticoid receptors from cortisol binding. Some tissues, like the liver,can convert inactive cortisone back to active cortisol through an enzyme called 11-beta-HSD1 (\"B\"in the image). This completes the \"cortisone-cortisol shuttle\" because the kidney can inactivatecortisol where it is not needed and the liver can reactivate it afterward.627The Cortisol - Cortisone ShuntMineralocorticoidreceptorCortisoneCortisone11ẞ-hydroxysteroiddehydrogenase - 111ẞ-hydroxysteroiddehydrogenase - 2CortisolCortisolGlucocorticoidreceptorCentral nervous systemLiverAdipose tissuePlacentaOMARROWSalivary glandsSweat glandsKidneyColonPlacentaHowever, when circulating cortisol levels are very high, as in severe Cushing syndrome, they canoverwhelm this protective mechanism, allowing cortisol to bind to and activate themineralocorticoid receptor. This leads to volume expansion, hypertension, and hypokalemia oftenobserved in hypercortisolism. A mutation of 11-beta-HSD2 also causes a similar clinical pictureand is the reason for the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess.17ẞ-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 3ẞ-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase are involved in themetabolism of sex steroids.",

This is becausegiving thyroxine first can enhance cortisol clearance and precipitate an adrenal crisis. Also,levothyroxine increases the basal metabolic rate (BMR) leading to an increased requirement ofcortisol, which if not met can also precipitate an adrenal crisis.",
