      "question": "A 60-year-old woman is diagnosed with melanoma. On examination, a palpable lymph nodewas present in the posterior triangle. Biopsy revealed presence of tumour cells. Which of thefollowing drugs used to treat this condition is a MEK inhibitor?844",
      "options": {
        "A": "Dabrafenib",
        "B": "Vemurafenib",
        "C": "Trametinib",
        "D": "Ipilimumab"
      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The scenario is suggestive of metastatic melanoma and trametinib is used in this condition. It is areversible inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular signal regulated kinase (MEK). It inhibitsthe serine-threonine kinase domain of BRAF V600E mutant of MEK.It is widely used in the treatment of metastatic or unresectable melanoma. It can be used as asingle agent but it is more effective when used with BRAF inhibitors like dabrafenib.Adverse effects of this drug include rash, diarrhea, increased ALT, abdominal pain, stomatitis,increased AST, anemia, etc.Dabrafenib and vemurafenib are BRAF inhibitors used in metastatic melanoma.Ipilimumab is a human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) blocking antibody used inmetastatic or unresectable melanoma.Recent update: The FDA has approved the combination of the BRAF inhibitor encorafenib and theMEK inhibitor binimetinib for the treatment of patients with BRAF-mutant unresectable ormetastatic melanoma.",
