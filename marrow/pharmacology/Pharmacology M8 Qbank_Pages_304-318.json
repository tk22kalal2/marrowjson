In addition, carbamazepine is an enzyme inducer andreduces the half-life of clozapine.Option D: Administration of clozapine requires regular blood count monitoring due to the risk ofagranulocytosis. Monitoring is performed weekly for the first 6 months and once in two weeks forthe next 6 months. Patients must be asked to report for evaluation in case of symptoms such asfever or sore throat.
