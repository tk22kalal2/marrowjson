      "explanation": "Single daily dose aminoglycoside administration is more preferable to multiple daily doseadministration because of the long post-antibiotic effect.For certain classes of drugs such as aminoglycosides and quinolones, its antimicrobial action isdependent on the peak concentration above MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration). It isreferred to as concentration-dependent killing.High-dose, extended-interval dosing schemes take advantage of the concentration-dependentactivity of aminoglycosides to achieve maximal initial bacterial killing. And then because of thepostantibiotic effect of aminoglycosides, good therapeutic response can be attained even whenconcentrations fall below MIC for a substantial fraction of the dosing interval.Therefore, a single daily dose would be equal to or more effective than multiple 8 hourlydoses. This dosing strategy may also reduce the ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity of these drugs.456Time-dependent killing is an effect seen when the antimicrobial action is dependent on theduration, the drug concentration remains above the MIC. Beta-lactams, macrolides, andvancomycin have this property.",

      "explanation": "The dose of aminoglycosides is to be reduced in patients with renal failure (AKI) becauseclearance of the drug is reduced.Aminoglycosides undergo minimum metabolism and are primarily excreted almost entirely byglomerular filtration. Therefore, renal failure decreases the clearance of the drug. Because theincidence of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity is likely related to the overall exposure toaminoglycosides, it is critical to reduce the maintenance dose and dosing interval of these drugs inpatients with impaired renal function.Option B: Renal clearances are increased and the half-life is reduced in cystic fibrosis patientsnecessitating higher doses.Option C: Burn patients have a more rapid drug clearance probably due to increased drug lossthrough burnt tissue and require higher doses in them.Option D: Aminoglycoside dose adjustment is not required in liver disease457",
