      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "This is a case of hypocalcemia following a massive blood transfusion and IV calcium gluconate isthe preferred treatment.The hypocalcemia results from Ca2+ chelation by citrate (added to the blood product aspreservative and anticoagulant). Calcium gluconate is the preferred over calcium chloride for theemergency treatment of hypocalcemia because it is less irritating and better tolerated.However, calcium chloride may be preferable to calcium gluconate in the presence of abnormalliver function, because decreased citrate metabolism results in a slower release of ionized calcium.It is generally reserved for severe symptomatic hypocalcemia, (&lt;4 mg/dL) and when given,should be administered via a central venous access device to avoid extravasation and tissuenecrosis.Calcium carbonate and calcium lactate are oral preparations of calcium.639",

They specifically inhibit bone resorption andthus are very effective for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.Bisphosphonates concentrate at sites of active remodeling. They remain in the matrix until thebone is remodeled. Then, they are released in the acid environment of the resorption lacunae andinduce apoptosis in osteoclasts.Classification of bisphosphonates (mainly based on potency):First-generation:• Etidronate (least potent)• Clodronate• TiludronateSecond-generation: 10-100 times more potent than the first generation• Alendronate• Pamidronate• IbadronateThird-generation: 10,000 times more potent than the first generation• RisedronateZoledronate",

      "explanation": "Bisphosphonates are not recommended to be administered with food to minimize esophagealirritation.Oral bisphosphonates have very limited bioavailability (&lt;1-10%). Bisphosphonates arerecommended to be administered after an overnight fast with a full glass of water at least 30minutes before breakfast.Options A and B- Remaining upright for 30 minutes after dosing and taking proton pumpinhibitors at bedtime can decrease the symptoms.Option C- As esophageal irritation is due to the local direct effect of the oral formulation, shiftingto intravenous formulations reduces the symptoms.Note- The prescribing information of all the oral bisphosphonates states that it has to be takenalong with tap or filtered water, and not mineral water as it contains higher amounts of calciumwhich can interfere with the absorption of bisphosphonates. It is prudent to inform patients to nothave the medications with water having higher calcium levels.641",
