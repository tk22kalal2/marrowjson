      "question": "A 24-year-old woman who was started on treatment for MDR-TB 6 months back, presentedwith complaints of fatigue, amenorrhea, and constipation since the past 1 month. Onexamination, a swelling was noticed on the anterior aspect of her neck. Her lab reports showraised TSH levels with low free T3 and T4 levels. Which anti-tubercular drug is likely to causethis adverse effect?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Streptomycin",
        "B": "Pyrazinamide",
        "C": "Cycloserine",
        "D": "Ethionamide"
      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "578The given clinical features and lab reports are suggestive of hypothyroidism with goiter, which is aknown adverse effect of ethionamide.MDR-TB is treated with 2nd line agents that include ethionamide (ETH). ETH is not a first-lineagent due to its gastrointestinal side effects. It is structurally related to thionamides(propylthiouracil and methimazole) and therefore causes hypothyroidism by preventingorganification of iodine in thyroid hormone synthesis. Another antitubercular drug that can causehypothyroidism is Para-amino salicylic acid (PAS).ETH/PAS-induced hypothyroidism should be treated with thyroxine replacement therapy, insteadof changing the regimen. Thyroid function usually optimizes within 2 months after completingMDR therapy.",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The mechanism of anti-mycobacterial action of bedaquiline is by inhibition of ATP synthase.Bedaquiline is a diarylquinoline that targets the subunit c of the ATP synthase of M. tuberculosis.This leads to inhibition of the proton pump activity of the ATP synthase and causes a failure in thebacillary energy metabolism.",

      "question": "575A 68-year-old man with hypertension was diagnosed with drug-resistant pulmonary TB. Oneweek after starting ATT he presented to the casualty following an episode of syncope. ECGshowed a corrected QT interval of 477ms, which is shown below. Which drug used in hisanti-tubercular therapy is responsible for this adverse effect?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Clofazimine",

        "D": "Para-amino salicylic acidav12V5.VE"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario along with a corrected QT (QTc) interval of 477ms is suggestive of QTcprolongation which is an adverse effect associated with bedaquiline.In the ECG QTc (corrected QT interval= QT/√RR) is 477ms. Normal QTc is about 440ms. Valuesof more than 440ms in males and 460ms in females are considered to be prolonged. QTcprolongation usually presents as syncope or cardiac arrest.Although QT prolongation can cause Torsades de pointes, no cases have been reported withbedaquiline. A 5-fold higher rate of death has been reported in patients on bedaquiline versusthose on placebo. Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) advises caution whenadministering this medication. Bedaquiline is contraindicated in the age group of &lt;18 years.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Delamanid acts by inhibiting mycolic acid synthesis.Pretomanid and delamanid are bicyclic nitroimidazoles that act by inhibiting mycolic acid (acomponent of the mycobacterial cell wall) and protein synthesis in the mycobacteria.Pretomanid in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid was approved by FDA in 2019 for thetreatment of adult patients with extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB and for patients whoare treatment-intolerant or nonresponsive to multidrug-resistant pulmonary(MDR) TB treatment.579In India, delamanid is only approved for the management of MDR-TB.Isoniazid also acts by inhibiting mycolic acid synthesis.Other options:Option A: Bedaquiline acts by inhibition of ATP synthase. It is a diarylquinoline that targetsthe subunit c of the ATP synthase of M. tuberculosis. This leads to inhibition of the proton pumpactivity of the ATP synthase and causes a failure in the bacillary energy metabolism.Option C: Fluoroquinolones act by inhibition of DNA gyrase. They are used as second-line agentsin the treatment of tuberculosis.Option D: Cycloserine is a D-alanine analogue used as a second-line drug for MDR-TB that actsby inhibition of alanine racemase. Alanine racemase converts L-alanine to D-alanine which isneeded for the mycobacterial cell wall.",
