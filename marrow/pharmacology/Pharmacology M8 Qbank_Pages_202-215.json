      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Loop diuretics have the maximum efficacy. They act on the thick ascending loop of Henle by blocking Na+-K+-2Cl- symporter. Option A: Although 65% of Na+ is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, diuretics acting here do not have maximum efficacy. This is because the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle has a great reabsorptive capacity and it absorbs most of the filtrate from the proximal tubule. Options C and D: Diuretics acting distal to the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle have limited efficacy because most of the reabsorption of Na+ (>90%) would have already occurred by the time the tubular fluid reaches there.",

Option C: They are also used in the treatment of edema associated with CHF, hepatic cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome.

It is a thiazide diuretic and causeshypokalemia, which can counteract the hyperkalemia caused by lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor.Aldosterone causes Na+ absorption in the collecting duct and the distal tubule in exchange for H+and K+. ACE inhibitors decrease angiotensin II levels and thereby, decrease aldosterone levels.Decreased aldosterone level causes K+ retention by reducing the exchange. Therefore, ACEinhibitors cause retention of K+.Diuretics that cause elevation of plasma K+ levels are not suitable for combining with ACEinhibitors.Potassium-sparing diuretics like spironolactone, eplerenone, and amiloride are contraindicatedwith ACE inhibitors.",
