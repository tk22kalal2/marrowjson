      "explanation": "Moclobemide is a reversible and selective inhibitor of the MAO-A enzyme.Monoamine hypothesis states that in depression, there is a decrease in monoamines like serotonin(5HT) and norepinephrine. These monoamines are metabolized by the enzyme monoamineoxidase (MAO). MAO inhibitors, therefore, increase these monoamines by inhibiting the enzyme.The various classes of drugs used in depression and anxiety are listed below:Class of drugsSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI)Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitorsTricyclic antidepressantsExamplesFluoxetine FluvoxamineParoxetineSertralineCitalopramVenlafaxineDesvenlafaxineDuloxetine MilnacipranAtypical antipsychoticsAmitriptylineImipramineNortriptylineDesipramineAmoxapineAripiprazoleOlanzapineQuetiapineRisperidoneMonoamine oxidase inhibitor IsocarboxazidSelegilinePhenes (MAO)lzine MoclobemideAtypical antidepressants",

      "explanation": "The given clinical presentation of a hypertensive crisis in a patient on MAO inhibitor therapy issuggestive of cheese reaction, which is seen after consumption of foods rich in tyramine (beer).Tyramine is an indirect sympathomimetic. It induces the release of catecholamines from theneurons. Tyramine can be produced in high concentrations in protein-rich foods bydecarboxylation of tyrosine during fermentation.Normally tyramine is inactivated when taken orally because it is readily metabolized by MAO inthe liver. In patients who are on MAO inhibitor therapy, the tyramine taken in the diet is notinactivated and results in its increased sympathomimetic effect resulting in elevated bloodpressure, termed as hypertensive crisis or cheese reaction. Drug of choice for cheese reaction is IVphentolamine.When MAO inhibitors are taken along with SSRI or TCA, it results in serotonin syndrome due tothe overstimulation of 5HT receptors. The clinical features are a triad of:•Cognitive effect - delirium, coma•Autonomic effects- hypertension, tachycardia• Somatic effects- myoclonus, hyperreflexia, tremors350Cheese reactionDOC → PhentolamineCheese, beer, red wine, and banana contain tyramineIn the presence of MAO-I, it escapes degradationMAReaches systemic circulationUptake by adrenergic neuronWEnters storage vesicles and displaces NEHypertensive crisisOMARROW",

      "explanation": "Tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline are competitive antagonists of muscarinic receptors.Atropine being an antimuscarinic drug should not be administered.Tricyclic antidepressant overdose presents with anticholinergic effects. Hypotension occursbecause of alpha1 receptor blockade.TCAs act on Na+ channels and cause slowed conduction and depressed cardiac contractilityresulting in serious arrhythmias. Seizures and agitation may occur followed by depression.Management of TCA overdose:• Initial resuscitation by securing airway, breathing, and circulation..• Hypotension - IV fluids and norepinephrine infusion.352• Cardiac-depressant effects - bolus dose of sodium bicarbonate helps overcome Na+ blockade byincreasing extracellular Na+. It also addresses metabolic acidosis which is often present.• Arrhythmias - lignocaine for ventricular arrhythmias.•Seizures benzodiazepines like diazepam/lorazepam.-Physostigmine can reverse anticholinergic effects but can aggravate cardiac depression and causeseizures.
