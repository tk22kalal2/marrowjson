      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Aromatase (CYP19) converts testosterone to estradiol. Certain effects of testosterone are mediatedby estradiol.In men with deficient CYP19 or ER receptors, the epiphyses do not fuse, the long bones growindefinitely and such patients are osteoporotic. Administration of estradiol can correct the boneabnormalities in CYP19 deficiency. However, this cannot be used in those with ER receptordefects.Testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by 5-alpha-reductase.Androstanedione and epiandrosterone are metabolites of DHT due to the action of 17-beta-HSD.",

        "A": "5-alpha reductase inhibitor",

        "D": "Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator (SARM)"
      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Flutamide acts by competitive inhibition of androgen receptors and is used to treat prostatecancer.Flutamide is a non-steroidal antiandrogen that competes with androgens such as testosterone anddihydrotestosterone for binding to the androgen receptors in the prostate gland. By doing so, itprevents them from stimulating the prostate cancer cells to grow.In addition to its use in prostate cancer, flutamide has been used to treat hyperandrogenism(excess androgen levels) in women, such as in those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and691Hirsutism.Other anti-androgens are:• Bicalutamide, apalutamide, and nilutamide•• Spironolactone (aldosterone antagonist with antiandrogen activity)•Cyproterone acetate (progestin with antiandrogen activity)• Cimetidine (H2 blocker with anti-androgen activity)Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs) are a class of androgen receptor ligands thathave similar anabolic properties to anabolic steroids, but with reduced androgenic side effects.There are no FDA-approved SARMs at present.",

      "explanation": "Gossypol is a non-steroidal agent that inhibits spermatogenesis.Gossypol is obtained from cottonseed. It inhibits spermatogenesis by exerting toxic effects onseminiferous tubules but has low efficacy. Libido and potency are not significantly affected andfertility usually returns after a few months of discontinuation of the drug. But, around 10% of thepatients may remain infertile. Hypokalemia is a major adverse effect and may even lead totransient paralysis.Low efficacy and significant toxicity have caused gossypol to be abandoned as a candidate malecontraceptive.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Tadalafil is a PDE-5 inhibitor used in the treatment of patients with erectile dysfunction.Penile erection is mediated by NO and cGMP. During arousal, the corpus cavernosum producesnitric oxide which in turn stimulates the formation of cGMP. This leads to relaxation of thesmooth muscle of corpus cavernosum and penile arteries, causing engorgement of corpuscavernosum producing an erection. The biological actions of cGMP are terminated by692phosphodiesterase enzymes and PDE-5 is the major cGMP metabolizing enzyme in the peniletissue.Phosphodiesterase-5-inhibitors include:• Sildenafil• Tadalafil - Longest acting (24-36 hrs), bioavailability is not affected by food• Vardenafil.• Avanafil - Most Rapid-acting (within 15 -30 mins)Option A: Podofilox topical cream is used in the treatment of genital warts and molluscumcontagiosum lesions.Option B: Finasteride is a 5 ° -reductase inhibitor.Option C: Apalutamide is a androgen receptor antagonist.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Visual disturbance seen with sildenafil is due to PDE-6 inhibition.Sildenafil is used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction principally due to its inhibitory actionson PDE-5 (Phosphodiesterase 5) in the vascular tissues of the corpus cavernosa. However, it alsoexerts minor inhibitory action against PDE-6, which is present exclusively in rod and conephotoreceptors and results in blurring and blue-green tinting of vision.Tadalafil and avanafil have better PDE-5/PDE-6 selectivity, compared to sildenafil and vardenafiland hence have lesser visual side effects.",

      "explanation": "All anabolic steroids have significant androgenic action and the use of anabolic steroids byathletes is not recommended.Testosterone and its derivatives are used for their anabolic effects but they have significantandrogenic action. Some of them (17 methyl derivatives) are also hepatotoxic. The currentconsensus is to advise against the use of such anabolic steroids.694",
