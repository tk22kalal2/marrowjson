      "explanation": "After 3 hours, 162mg of the drug will remain.In first-order kinetics, a constant fraction of the drug is excreted in a given time.In the given question,20mg out of 200mg is excreted in 90 minutes,20/200 = 0.1 fraction is eliminated every 90 minutes.After 90 minutes, 200mg - 20 mg = 180 mg remainsThe next 90 minutes (i.e. after 180 minutes) = 180 x 0.1 = 18 mg is eliminated.71Therefore, 180 - 18 = 162 mg remains.Simpler way:1/10 fraction of the drug is excreted in 90 minutes → 9/10 remains after 90 minutes.3 hours (180 min) is 2 times 90 minutes.So 200 x (9/10)(9/10) = 162 mg remains after 180 minutes",
