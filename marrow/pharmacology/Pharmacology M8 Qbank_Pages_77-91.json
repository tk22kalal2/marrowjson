      "explanation": "Neostigmine prolongs the muscle relaxation caused by suxamethonium (succinylcholine) insteadof reversing the block.The contraction of a muscle is achieved by a cycle of ACh binding and itsdegradation. Depolarising neuromuscular blockers (such as suxamethonium) acts by binding tothe receptors much longer than ACh and causing a prolonged depolarization, resulting in aneventual blocking of neuromuscular transmission and flaccid paralysis.87AChE metabolizes ACh and plasma cholinesterase metabolizes suxamethonium (SCh).Neostigmine blocks both enzymes. By inhibiting AChE, neostigmine increases the AChconcentration in the synaptic cleft. But this cannot reverse the block as the depolarized nerves areunresponsive to any stimuli during this period. However, the simultaneous inhibition of plasmacholinesterase decreases the degradation of SCh and therefore potentiates the neuromuscularblock of suxamethonium, resulting in prolonged muscle relaxation.Neostigmine can be used only as a reversal agent for neuromuscular blockade caused bycompetitive non-depolarising blockers such as vecuronium.ANS- Parasympathetic systemMitochondriaGlycolysisB-oxidationAcetyl-CoAPresynapticmembranePostsynapticmembraneCholineAcetylcholine (Ach)Chat+VesamicolHemicholinum(Rate-limitingstep)AchAchAchAch)Ach)AchCholinergic receptorAminoglycosidesCa2+ActionpotentialBotulinum toxinSNAPReAnti AchEAcetyl-CoA + CholineAcetylcholinesteraseSNAPReChaTSoluble N-ethylmalamide Attachment protein ReceptorCholine acetyl Tranferase©MARROW",

      "explanation": "Atropine is useful in organophosphate poisoning because it is a competitive antagonist ofacetylcholine.An acetylcholinesterase enzyme has an esteratic and an anionic site.

It has relatively insignificant action on nicotinic receptors.Atropine antagonizes these parasympathetic effects by competitive inhibition of acetylcholine atthe muscarinic receptors.Pralidoxime reactivates the acetylcholinesterase, which had been deactivated in organophosphatepoisoning. Pralidoxime attaches to the anionic site of the enzyme that remains unoccupied.
