      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Orciprenaline is a beta 2 receptor agonist that has uterine relaxing property.Oxytocics are uterine stimulants that increase uterine motility, especially at term.Uterine stimulants are:• Posterior pituitary hormones - oxytocin/pitocin.•.Ergot derivatives - ergometrine, methylergometrineProstaglandins - PGE2, PGF2 alpha, and others• Others quinine, ethacridineEthacridine is used as an abortifacient.",

      "question": "A 32-year-old multipara at 40 weeks gestation developed water intoxication andhyponatremia following prolonged IV infusion with oxytocin by an inexperienced juniorresident. This adverse effect is due to oxytocin's action on which of the following sites?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Vasopressin V2 receptors on serosal surface of renal tubular cells",
        "B": "Vasopressin V2 receptors on luminal surface of renal tubular cells",
        "C": "Vasopressin V1 receptors on serosal surface of renal tubular cells",
        "D": "Vasopressin V1 receptors on luminal surface of renal tubular cells"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Oxytocin can bind to V2 receptors on the serosal surface of renal tubular cells resulting in reducedfree water clearance.This is because oxytocin and vasopressin have structural similarities. Oxytocin can havevasopressin (ADH) like activity at V2 receptors. The increase in water permeability occurs throughthe insertion of aquaporins (water channels) in collecting tubules.Prolonged i.v. administration at high doses in conjunction with large volumes of hypotonic fluidmay cause water intoxication associated with hyponatremia.698To avoid this complication, whenever high doses of oxytocin are administered over a long time:• An electrolyte-containing diluent must be used (not dextrose)• The volume of infused fluid should be kept low (by infusing oxytocin at a higher concentration)Fluid intake must be restricted, fluid balance chart should be kept and serum electrolytes shouldbe monitored",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "699Ergot derivatives are indicated for the prevention and/or treatment of postpartum hemorrhage.Ergot alkaloids markedly increase the motor activity of the uterus. The capacity to inducesustained uterine tetany and fetal distress exclude their use in the initiation or facilitation oflabor.Due to the high incidence of postoperative vomiting and lack of evidence in reducing bleeding,routine or prophylactic use of uterotonic medications at the time of MTP is not recommended.Ergot alkaloids used in PPH include ergometrine and methylergometrine.",

      "explanation": "Progesterone can be given prophylactically to reduce the risk of preterm labor.It inhibits the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and delays cervical ripening. Therefore,progesterone and its derivatives have been advocated to diminish the onset of preterm labor inwomen at high risk due to previous preterm delivery.700Intramuscular hydroxyprogesterone administered weekly as well as vaginal administration hasboth been shown to reduce the incidence of preterm delivery.Ritodrine, terbutaline, and nifedipine are tocolytics that are indicated for inhibition of uterinecontractions of preterm labor and not for prophylaxis against preterm labor.701",
