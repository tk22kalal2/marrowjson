      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Phenytoin follows first-order kinetics at lower concentrations and as the concentration increases,the elimination changes to zero-order kinetics. The rate of elimination of phenytoin varies withthe serum concentration.As the blood levels rise, the maximal capacity of the liver to metabolize phenytoin is reached. Thuseven a small increase in the dosage can result in disproportionally high plasma levels. Therefore,it requires therapeutic drug monitoring.About 90% of phenytoin is bound to plasma proteins, mainly albumin. Phenytoin is metabolizedby the CYP enzymes in the liver.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Fosphenytoin like phenytoin requires continuous ECG monitoring during IV infusion due to therisk of arrhythmias.Fosphenytoin is a water-soluble prodrug of phenytoin. Fosphenytoin is also extensively proteinbound, mainly albumin. This binding is saturable and fosphenytoin displaces phenytoin fromprotein-binding sites.Hydrolysis of fosphenytoin yields phosphate, which increases the risk of hyperphosphatemia inpatients with renal failure. It is contraindicated in patients with sinus bradycardia, sino-atrialblock, second and third-degree A-V block.278",
