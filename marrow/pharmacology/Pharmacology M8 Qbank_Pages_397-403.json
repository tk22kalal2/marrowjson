      "question": "Ethanol ingestion results in enhanced diuresis. What is the most probable mechanismcausing this?",

        "A": "Inhibition of ADH action in collecting tubules",
        "B": "Stimulation of ADH action in collecting tubules",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Ethanol inhibits the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)/ vasopressin from the posteriorpituitary gland. This results in enhanced diuresis observed with ethanol ingestion.Inhibition of ADH action in collecting tubules is not the mechanism by which alcohol inducesdiuresis. Stimulation of ADH release or action will have an antidiuretic action.",

      "explanation": "Acute consumption of ethanol inhibits the function of several cytochrome enzymes that areinvolved in the metabolism of drugs. CYP2E1 is one of the isoenzymes that is specificallyinhibited.Chronic consumption of alcohol causes induction of cytochrome enzymes, particularly CYP2E1,increasing the rate of metabolism of drugs dependent on CYP2E1 for metabolism.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Disulfiram is an irreversible inhibitor of both cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of aldehydedehydrogenase.Ethanol consumption during disulfiram therapy can lead to increased concentrations ofacetaldehyde. Increased acetaldehyde levels can cause flushing, pulsating headache, throbbingpain in the head and neck, and other aversive reactions.Disulfiram is indicated in alcohol deaddiction maintenance therapy.Option 1: Fomepizole is an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase.Option 3: Acamprosate is an NMDA receptor antagonist with modest GABA-A receptor agonisticactivity.Option 4: Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that suppresses craving in chronic alcoholics.401Option 5: Chlordiazepoxide is a benzodiazepine that can be used to treat acute alcohol withdrawaland anxiety.",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The given clinical picture and labs are suggestive of accidental methanol toxicity. Hemodialysis isused in severe cases of methanol toxicity.402A serum methanol concentration greater than 50 mg/dl is serious enough to considerhemodialysis. It can be used to remove both methanol and its toxic metabolite formic acid fromthe blood.Option A: Fomepizole, an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor, is administered intravenously inmethanol toxicity. It acts by inhibiting the formation of formic acid.Option B: Intravenous ethanol is an alternative to fomepizole. It has a higher affinity to alcoholdehydrogenase than methanol. Thus, saturation of ADH enzymes results in less formation of toxicformic acid.Option D: Folate-dependent systems are responsible for the oxidation of formic acid to CO2. Bothfolinic and folic acid are often administered during methanol toxicity but the exact benefit is yet tobe determined.Note: Ethanol is given intravenously in the management of methanol and ethylene glycolpoisoning.",
