        "D": "Carbidopa"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Levodopa crosses the blood-brain barrier.It is a naturally occurring aromatic amino acid and an immediate precursor of dopamine that cancross the blood-brain barrier. Dopamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier because of thepolar nature of the molecule. Levodopa is also a polar compound but it can cross the blood-brainbarrier through an aromatic amino acid transporter.Therefore, levodopa is used therapeutically when dopamine is required for central action.Levodopa is converted to dopamine by the decarboxylase enzyme.Carbidopa is a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor and does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Domperidone is an antidopaminergic antiemetic that can reverse levodopa-induced emesiswithout affecting the therapeutic potential as it cannot cross the blood-brain barrier.The antiemetic effect is through its action on CTZ which is outside the blood-brain barrier.Option A: Typical antipsychotics like phenothiazines can reduce the efficacy of levodopa becauseof its central D2 blocking property.Option B: Levodopa is a prodrug. It is converted into dopamine by the decarboxylase enzyme inCNS.Option C: Pyridoxine can reduce the effect of levodopa by increasing its peripheral conversion todopamine by potentiating peripheral dopa decarboxylase enzyme.",

      "explanation": "Behavioral adverse effects like confusion, hallucinations, nightmares, delusions, posturalhypotension are not reduced after the addition of carbidopa.In fact, they are increased in patients who are taking levodopa with peripheral decarboxylaseinhibitors. This is because higher levels of dopamine are formed in CNS.The combination of levodopa with peripheral decarboxylase inhibitors like carbidopa inhibitsperipheral adverse effects of dopamine. This decreases the adverse effects like:• Anorexia, nausea, and vomiting•Cardiac arrhythmias• On and off effect of motor performance",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The symptoms in this patient are suggestive of restless leg syndrome and gabapentin is thefirst-line choice of treatment for this condition.Restless leg syndrome is a typical sensory-motor disorder that generally affects the legs duringrest periods, especially sleep. There is an irresistible urge to shake the legs associated withburning sensation, itching, and cramps of the legs. In idiopathic cases, dopaminergichypofunction is postulated.In patients with restless legs syndrome, iron stores are initially repleted, and the aggravatingfactors are eliminated. If RLS still persists, initial therapy with a gabapentinoid (pregabalin,gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil) are preferred, rather than a dopamine agonist (pramipexole,ropinirole, rotigotine). This is due to the high frequency of intermediate and long-termaugmentation with dopamine agonists, as well as their risk of impulse control disorders.FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of restless leg syndrome:•• Gabapentin•• Ropinirole• Pramipexole•⚫ RotigotineA dopamine agonist is used as an alternative in patients with increased risk for side effects fromgabapentinoids, such as those with obesity and its complications, a past or present history ofmoderate to severe depression, a disorder causing gait instability or respiratory failure, and ahistory of substance use disorder.Option A: Benztropine is an anticholinergic that can be used for drug-induced parkinsonism.Option C: Riluzole is a benzothiazole derivative that is used in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Option D: Benzodiazepines like clonazepam can be used as co-adjuvant drugs in the treatment ofrestless leg syndrome but should not be used as first-line therapy.",
