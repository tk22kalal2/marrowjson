      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Levetiracetam has a binding affinity to synaptic vesicular protein SV2A. SV2A plays a role invesicle recycling following exocytosis of neurotransmitterWhen levetiracetam bind to this synaptic vesicular protein, it decreases the release of excitatoryneurotransmitter glutamate thus preventing seizures.Levetiracetam also inhibits N-type Ca2+ channels and Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Thus,it is considered a broad-spectrum antiepileptic as it has an effect on multiple channels.",

      "explanation": "Gabapentin exerts its analgesic activity by inhibiting the Ca2+ channel current in this patient whois most likely suffering from post-herpetic neuralgia.Gabapentin and pregabalin have close structural similarity to GABA. Still, they do not act throughthe effects of GABA receptors or any other mechanism related to GABA-mediatedneurotransmission.They inhibit the calcium channel current which decreases the entry of calcium in the presynapticneuron. When calcium entry in the neuron is reduced, there is a decrease in the release ofglutamate. This lowers the excitability of the neuron, thus reducing seizure activity.Therapeutic use of these drugs:Gabapentin: Focal seizures, postherpetic neuralgia painPregabalin: Focal seizures, postherpetic neuralgia pain, diabetic neuropathy pain, spinal cordinjury pain, fibromyalgia pain.",
