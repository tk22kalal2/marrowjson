      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The mechanism of action of nitrates in prinzmetal angina is endothelium-independent coronaryvasodilatation.Prinzmetal angina occurs due to vasospasm of the coronary arteries. Nitrates relax the smoothmuscles of epicardial coronary arteries and relieve coronary artery spasm.In the case of stable angina, the primary mechanism of action of nitrates is preferential dilatationof veins (by increasing cGMP). Venous dilatation leads to a decrease in the venous return to theheart (preload). This decreases the ventricular end-diastolic volume and thereby a decrease inmyocardial oxygen consumption. The diastolic perfusion pressure (aortic blood pressure indiastole - left ventricular pressure in diastole) is increased.",

      "explanation": "The mechanism of action of sodium nitrite as an antidote for cyanide poisoning is by thedevelopment of methemoglobinemia.Cyanide binds to the cytochrome oxidase (complex IV) of the electron transport chain (ETC),thereby blocking it. When sodium nitrite is administered, it releases the nitrite ion. This ion bindsto hemoglobin to form methemoglobin. The methemoglobin so formed, has a high affinity for thecyanide ion and binds to it, thus, detaching it from the cytochrome oxidase. This regeneratesactive cytochrome normalizing the function of ETC.The cyanide ion with methemoglobin forms cyanmethemoglobin. Sodium thiosulphate isadministered for the elimination of this compound. The thiosulfate forms thiocyanate ion withthe cyanide and this is readily excreted.",

It results in an abrupt decrease in blood pressure resulting in reflex tachycardia.Increased contractility leads to an increase in O2 demand which may precipitate angina.Option A: Amlodipine and extended-release preparations of nifedipine do not cause a steep fall inblood pressure and subsequent activation of sympathetic tone. Therefore, they are less likely toprecipitate angina.Options C and D: Verapamil and diltiazem have relatively less action on peripheral vascularsmooth muscles.
