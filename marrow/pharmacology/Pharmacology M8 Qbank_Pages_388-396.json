      "explanation": "392The given clinical picture points towards opioid-induced constipation. Methylnaltrexone, anopioid antagonist with predominant peripheral action is best suited for treating opioid-inducedconstipation.Methylnaltrexone is a peripheral µ receptor antagonist. It was introduced in the treatment ofopioid-induced constipation refractory to other measures.It is a quaternary ammonium compound and hence cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. It canreverse the effects mediated by peripheral opioid receptors and spares CNS effects like analgesia.The peripherally acting opioid antagonists include:• Methylnaltrexone.• Naloxegol•Naldemedine• Alvimopan",

      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Methadone is used as a substitute drug for the maintenance therapy of opioid (heroin)dependence. This is because of its good oral bioavailability and long half-life.Methadone is substituted for opioids during detoxification to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Oncestabilized, the dose is gradually reduced and the drug is stopped slowly over days.Due to its long half-life and accumulation in tissues, discontinuing the drug still results in lowconcentrations of the drug in plasma resulting in protracted withdrawal symptoms.394Maintainance therapy for opioid dependence:• Long-acting opioid agonist - a safer substitute like methadone is given in a supervised manner toprevent withdrawal symptoms•Partial agonist - buprenorphine can also be used•⚫ Clonidine, lofexidine - alpha-2 agonists act as sympatholytic and reduce the withdrawalsymptoms• LAAM (L-Alpha-Acetyl-Methadol) - opioid agonist which reduces craving•• Naltrexone - is an opioid antagonist used in maintenance therapy to prevent relapses",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Naltrexone is used for the prevention of relapse in opioid addiction.It is given only after initial opioid detoxification. The patient should be opioid-free for 7-10 daysand have a negative naloxone challenge (no withdrawal after naloxone administration).Naltrexone is a pure opioid antagonist which is more potent than naloxone. It is orally active andhas a long duration of action which makes it suitable for opioid blockade therapy in post-addicts.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Discontinuation of naltrexone does not cause withdrawal symptoms",
        "B": "It satisfies craving in opioid addicts",
        "C": "It blocks the effects of opioids if they are used",
        "D": "It is administered only when the patient has completed detoxification from opioids"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Naltrexone does not satisfy the craving of opioid addicts. It is an opioid antagonist with a highaffinity for u opioid receptors.Naltrexone does not suppress craving in opioid addiction but it suppresses craving in chronicalcoholics.Opioid agonists such as methadone and buprenorphine suppress craving and withdrawalsymptoms and are therefore used in the first stage of detoxification in opioid addiction.Option A: Discontinuation of naltrexone ingestion has no negative physical consequences, asopposed to discontinuation of agonist maintenance therapies, which results in the emergence ofopioid withdrawal symptoms. This is a major reason for noncompliance and treatment failure.Option C: It blocks the effects of opioids and prevents the user from experiencing subjectivesymptoms of opioid intoxication such as euphoria on subsequent use. As the user does notexperience these symptoms, he does not develop a craving for the substance. Thus, naltrexoneprevents relapse.Option D: It is only administered when the patient has completed a medically superviseddetoxification from opioids because it can cause immediate withdrawal symptoms.",
