As a component of MDT, it has been found tohasten the bacteriological and clinical response.Among the macrolides, clarithromycin has activity against leprosy bacilli and is used foralternative MDT in cases resistant to both rifampicin and fluoroquinolones. Azithromycin showsactivity against Mycobacterium avium complex but not lepra bacilli.Note: Rifampicin is the most potent bactericidal anti leprotic drug.",

It is indicated in recurring and persistent ENL lesions despite the completion of at leasttwo courses of glucocorticoid therapy.587Thalidomide is not effective in type 1 lepra reaction. If type 1 reactions occur after initiation ofantimycobacterial therapy, they are termed reversal reactions and it is histologically moretuberculoid. When they occur before the initiation, they are termed downgrading reactions and itis histologically more lepromatous.",
