      "explanation": "Vasomotor reversal of Dale is a blockade of alpha (° 1) followed by stimulation of beta (ẞ2)receptors.Normally, a high dose of epinephrine injected produces an ° 1-mediated rise in BP followed by aẞ2-mediated fall in BP.Administration of epinephrine after administration of ° -blockers produces only a fall in BP. Thisis because the° -mediated response is abolished and hence, only the ẞ-mediated response is seen,resulting in a fall in BP. This phenomenon is called the vasomotor reversal of Dale.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Dobutamine is used to perform a stress test.Stress echocardiography is primarily done for the evaluation of myocardial ischemia. The basicprinciple is to increase cardiac stress (either with exercise or with a drug) in a controlled fashion,to aid with the identification and localization of ischemic areas (by detecting new or worseningwall motion abnormalities).Performing stress echocardiography with a pharmacologic agent such as dobutamine allows forsimulation of increased heart rate and increased myocardial physiologic demands in patients whomay be unable to exercise due to musculoskeletal or pulmonary comorbidities.Dobutamine causes cardiac stress by acting on ẞ1-adrenergic receptors to increase cardiaccontractility and heart rate, and on ẞ2-adrenergic receptors to cause peripheral vasodilatation. Itis preferred over vasodilators used in stress echo tests such as adenosine, dipyridamole, andregadenoson (adenosine derivative).",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Salbutamol in large doses can result in hyperglycemia, not hypoglycemia.Option A: Tachycardia due to reflex sympathetic stimulation due to vasodilator action on ẞ2receptors and direct effect on cardiac ẞ1 receptors (ẞ2 selectivity is lost at high concentrations)Option B: Tolerance occurs due to desensitization on long-term useOption C: Hypokalemia due to direct effect on skeletal muscle uptake of K+ ions",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Mirabegron is a ẞ3 agonist used for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). Stimulation ofß3 receptors in detrusor muscle increases the bladder capacity and provides symptomatic relief inoveractive bladder.Antimuscarinic drugs are the mainstay of oral pharmacological treatment for OAB. It acts byinhibiting muscarinic receptor subtypes, M2 and M3 in the bladder. Both subtypes are expressedin multiple tissues, resulting in anticholinergic adverse events such as dry mouth, constipation,and cognitive impairment. These adverse effects are not seen with mirabegron as it acts viaadrenergic receptors.Mirabegron is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6. Hence, caution has to be exercised whenprescribing it along with CYP2D6 substrates such as metoprolol, desipramine, digoxin.",

        "D": "1:1000 I.V. - 0.5 ml"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Epinephrine (1:1000 solution) 0.5 ml via intramuscular route is preferred in the treatment ofanaphylactic shock.For intravenous use, 1:1000 adrenaline must be further diluted to 1:10,000 and should be usedvery cautiously as slow bolus.There is a much greater risk of causing harmful side effects by either inappropriate dosage ormisdiagnosis of anaphylaxis when using IV adrenaline. Hence, IM injection is preferred overintravenous (IV) bolus because it is faster in many situations and safer (lower risk ofcardiovascular complications, such as severe hypertension and ventricular arrhythmias).For intramuscular, subcutaneous, and inhalational (nebulization) routes of administration, 1:1000dilution can be used.109In cardiac arrest, the 1:1000 adrenaline must be diluted to 1:10,000 for IV use. The recommendeddose of epinephrine is 1mg = 10 mL of 1:10,000 solution IV administered every 3 to 5 minutesduring resuscitation as per the CPR guidelines.Epinephrine is also used in the treatment of hypotension, to induce local vasoconstriction toreduce the diffusion of local anaesthetics and to induce bronchodilation in asthma and COPD.",

      "question": "A patient was treated for septicemia with norepinephrine infusion. Which of the followingbest explains the benefit of this drug?",

        "A": "Bradycardia",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The benefit of using noradrenaline in septicemia is that it increases the mean arterial bloodpressure. It acts as a powerful peripheral vasoconstrictor and inotrope.Noradrenaline causes a rise in both systolic BP and diastolic BP, resulting in a rise in the meanarterial blood pressure. This increases the organ perfusion in patients in septic shockor cardiogenic shock.Another advantage of noradrenaline is that it does so without causing tachycardia, which is oftena troublesome event with other inotropes in critical care.Options A and B: The rise in mean arterial pressure causes reflex bradycardia which is not a majorcontributor to the treatment of septic shock.Option C: Low-dose dopamine infusions and furosemide are used to increase urine output incritically ill patients.",
