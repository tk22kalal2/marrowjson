      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The given image is of a spacer device. It decreases the incidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis andother propellant-mediated oropharyngeal adverse effects like dysphonia that occur with the use ofa pMDI.Spacers reduce the velocity and size of particles entering the upper airways. This reduces theamount of drug that impinges on the oropharynx and increases the proportion of drug inhaledinto lower airways. The systemic absorption is unchanged by the use of a spacer.Spacer devices are useful in delivering inhaled drugs to children who are not able to use a pMDIalone but can also be used by adults for better drug delivery. The image below shows the use of aspacer device with a face mask which is preferred in children younger than 3 years of age.The various devices used for the delivery of inhalational drugs are:• Pressurized metered-dose inhalers - Drugs are propelled from a canister in the pMDI with theaid of a propellant. These devices are convenient, portable, and typically deliver 50-200 doses of a794drugin N Paciregelmäßig innenWichtig: GehäuseVor Gebrauch schütteln!Allergospasmin Nreinigen80779• Dry powder inhalers - these devices scatter the drug into a fine powder that is dispersed by airturbulence on inhalation. DPIs have been developed to deliver drugs such as insulin, but thedosing is inconsistent. Children &lt;7 years find it difficult to use a DPI.EMPTYRATION ONLYUSE BY 04-2•Nebulizers: Two types of nebulizer are available -•Jet nebulizers that are driven by a stream of gas (air or oxygen)•⚫ Ultrasonic nebulizers that use a rapidly vibrating piezoelectric crystal and thus do not require asource of compressed gas.The nebulizers deliver much higher drug doses as compared pMDIs. These are useful in:• Treating acute exacerbations of asthma and COPD•Extreme airway obstruction (severe COPD)795• Delivering inhaled drugs to infants and small children who cannot use the other inhalationdevices• Administering drugs such as antibiotics in relatively high doses",

      "explanation": "Theophylline has an antagonistic action on adenosine receptors.Theophylline is a methylxanthine. It acts as a non-selective PDE inhibitor. Its other actionsinclude:• Increased IL-10 release• Decrease in gene transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines• Promotes apoptosis of granulocytes• Histone deacetylase activation. The recruitment of histone deacetylase-2 by glucocorticoidreceptors switches off inflammatory genes. Through this mechanism, theophylline enhances theanti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids.Theophylline can be used as a bronchodilator in an asthmatic patient on ICS as an add-on drug.LABAs are more effective but theophylline is a cheaper option.",

      "question": "A known case of CREST syndrome presents with dyspnea. On auscultation, a Graham-Steelemurmur is heard. On further investigation, her pulmonary artery pressure is found to be 28789mm Hg. Which drug will you use to manage her condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Non selective PDE inhibitors",
        "B": "Lipoxygenase inhibitors",
        "C": "Selective PDE-5 inhibitors",
        "D": "Cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors"
      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario points to a diagnosis of pulmonary artery hypertension (pulmonary arterypressure &gt; 20mmHg) which can be managed using selective PDE-5 inhibitors.Inhibition of PDE-5 in the pulmonary bed leads to a reduction in the hydrolysis of cGMP whichcauses pulmonary vasodilation.801Sildenafil and tadalafil are the PDE-5 inhibitors approved for use in PAH.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Riociguat is a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator (SGC), indicated in the treatment of pulmonaryartery hypertension.Riociguat increases the sensitivity of nitric oxide to SGC and also directly stimulates the sGCenzyme resulting in increased formation of cGMP. This leads to relaxation in the pulmonaryvasculature.",
