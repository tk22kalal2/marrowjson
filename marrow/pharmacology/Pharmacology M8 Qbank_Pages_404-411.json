Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is alife-threatening disease caused by the JC virus in patients with multiple sclerosis.It is more common when the patient is immunocompromised during their treatment withnatalizumab. The current recommendation is to start natalizumab only in a patient who testsnegative for JC antibodies.Seroconversion can occur anytime during treatment. Regular monitoring for JC antibody every 6months is recommended in JC antibody-negative patients on natalizumab.",

      "explanation": "This patient is most likely suffering from chorea associated with Huntington's disease, for whichtetrabenazine is indicated. It is a reversible inhibitor of vesicular monoamine transporter-2(VMAT-2).•Other drugs used in Huntington's disease are:Reserpine, an irreversible inhibitor of VMAT-2 and a longer-acting agent as compared totetrabenazine.• Deutetrabenazine refers to deuterium attached to carbon in place of hydrogen, in tetrabenazine(deuterated tetrabenazine). It is a newer form of tetrabenazine approved for the treatment ofchorea associated with Huntington's disease. It slows down its metabolism, hence it is longeracting than tetrabenazine. It is associated with better control of chorea.Option A - Benzhexol is a central anticholinergic indicated in parkinsonism.Option C - Tetrahydrozoline is a topical alpha-adrenergic agonist indicated for the relief ofconjunctival congestion.Option D - Benztropine is a muscarinic receptor antagonist that can be used for the managementof acute dystonia.",

      "explanation": "Edaravone was approved by the FDA for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).It has free radical scavenging properties that may reduce oxidative stress. The exact mechanism ofaction is unknown. It is to be administered as an IV infusion with an initial treatment cycle ofdaily dosing for 14 days, followed by a 14-day drug-free period. Subsequent treatment cyclesconsist of dosing on 10 of 14 days, followed by a 14 day drug-free period.The major adverse effect of edaravone is hypersensitivity because the infusion contains sodiumbisulfite. Other adverse effects include bruising, gait disorder, and headache.Tafinlar (dabrafenib) and Mekinist (trametinib), are both indicated as monotherapy in BRAFV600E/K (BRAF V600E mutation-positive) melanoma. They are approved for combinedadministration, for the treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) that cannot be removed bysurgery or that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic).Piracetam is a nootropic agent (a drug that enhances cognitive function) that is used off-label toenhance memory. It is also used to treat myoclonus.411",
