      "explanation": "Co-trimoxazole is a combination of trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole in the dose ratio of1:5 (trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole).The antimicrobial activity of this combination is because of its actions on sequential steps in thepathway of synthesis of tetrahydrofolic acid as shown in the image.Sulfonamides - Mechanism of actionDihyydropteroate diphosphate +para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)SulfonamidesDihydropteratesynthetaseDihydropteroic acidGlutamateMARKOWDihydrofolic acidNADPHTrimethoprimeNADPDihydrofolatereductaseTetrahydrofolic acid(THFA)OMARROWEach agent alone usually exerts bacteriostatic activity. But when an organism is sensitive to bothagents, bactericidal activity may be achieved.Because trimethoprim is more lipid-soluble than sulfamethoxazole, it has a larger volume ofdistribution than the latter drug.Therefore, when 1 part of trimethoprim is given with 5 parts of sulfamethoxazole (dose ratio is 1:5;trimethoprim:sulfamethoxazole), the peak plasma concentrations are in the ratio of 1:20, which isoptimal for the combined effects of these drugs in vitro.",

      "explanation": "The given neurovisceral symptoms following the use of sulfonamides point towards a diagnosis ofacute intermittent porphyria (AIP).AIP is a rare heme biosynthesis disorder due to a partial deficiency of the enzymeporphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD). Diagnosis is made based on elevated urine PBG levels.Alcohol, infections, pregnancy, and certain medications can trigger attacks by inducing hemesynthesis. This results in the accumulation of porphyrin precursors, causing symptoms.Side effects of sulfonamides are:• Acute intermittent porphyria - sulphonamides precipitate attacks• Hypersensitivity reaction - urticaria, erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme of theStevens-Johnson type, exfoliative dermatitis, and photosensitivity442••Crystalluria - due to low solubility. It is treated with good hydration and alkalization of urineHemolysis in G-6-PD deficiency (sulphonamides are oxidizers)• Kernicterus in the newborn (displace bilirubin)",

      "explanation": "Fluoroquinolones inhibit two essential type II topoisomerases, DNA gyrase (in gram-negativebacteria) and topoisomerase IV (in gram-positive bacteria).DNA gyrase introduces negative supercoils and thereby reduces the torsional strain that occurswhen double-stranded DNA is being unwound for replication or translation. Topoisomerases IV isresponsible for unlinking daughter chromosomes after replication. Quinolone antibiotics form acomplex with the topoisomerase enzyme and the DNA, and thereby block DNA replication andbacterial cell division.",
