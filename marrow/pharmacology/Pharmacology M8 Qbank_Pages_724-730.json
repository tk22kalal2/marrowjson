      "question": "A middle-aged woman with rheumatoid arthritis was on DMARD therapy with a drug thatincreases extracellular adenosine. Which drug was she likely on?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Methotrexate",
        "B": "Lefunamide",
        "C": "Sulphasalazine",
        "D": "Hydroxychloroquine724"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Methotrexate is the DMARD that increases extracellular adenosine.It is a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitor that leads to purine synthesis inhibition and thisis cytotoxic to lymphocytes.It also inhibits amino-imidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) transformylase andthymidylate synthetase. This leads to increased extracellular adenosine which isanti-inflammatory.The increased extracellular adenosine is hepatotoxic and hence monitoring with LFT is neededevery 2-3 months.Mechanism of action of methotrexateDihydrofolatereductaseMethotrexateAICAR(Amino-imidazole carboxamideribonucleotide transformylase)+Tetrahydrofolate andmethyltetrahydrofolate+Purine andpyrimidine synthesis+PolyaminesDe-novo purinesynthesis+LymphotoxinsOMARROW+AICARmetabolitesAdenosine deaminaseand AMP deaminase+Adenosine",

      "question": "A patient with rheumatoid arthritis on treatment with methotrexate came for a follow-upvisit. Her peripheral blood smear shows the following finding. What drug can beadministered to alleviate this side effect?",

        "C": "Thiamine",
        "D": "Folinic acid"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The peripheral smear findings point to a diagnosis of megaloblastic anemia. Folinic acid is givenwith methotrexate to decrease its side effects.Methotrexate is a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitor and thus can lead to a deficiency offolic acid which may present as megaloblastic anemia.Folinic acid/leucovorin calcium/citrovorum factor is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid.Thus, it decreases the side effects caused due to folate deficiency.",

Itis also used in the management of ulcerative colitis and regional enteritis.Sulfasalazine is metabolized into the following:•5-amino salicylic acid (5-ASA) - it is not absorbed and is used to treat ulcerative colitis.Sulfapyridine - it is absorbed and is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis.It is used as monotherapy in mild cases and as an add-on drug in moderate to severe cases.",
