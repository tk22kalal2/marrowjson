      "explanation": "120Atropine does not cause increased bowel sounds. It decreases the amplitude and frequency ofperistalsis, resulting in decreased bowel sounds.Peristalsis suppression due to atropine is incomplete because of the additional control ofperistalsis by local reflexes in the enteric nervous system and involvement of otherneurotransmitters like 5-HT, encephalin, dopamine in peristalsis.Actions of atropine:•Mydriasis by blocking the contraction of sphincter pupillae muscle-• Decreased secretions from salivary glands and lacrimal glands - by blocking M1 &amp; M3receptors•Tachycardia - due to its vagolytic activity at M2 receptor• Decreased sweating - by inhibiting sympathetic cholinergic supply to sweat glands which makesthe skin hot and dry (atropine fever).",

      "explanation": "Atropine at average clinical doses of 0.4-0.6 mg administered parenterally results in transientbradycardia followed by tachycardia.Parasympathetic postganglionic nerve terminals in the SA node contain presynaptic M1 receptors.These receptors normally inhibit the release of ACh. Therefore stimulation of these receptorsdecreases the release of ACh causing tachycardia. Inhibition of these receptors increases AChcausing bradycardia.Atropine initially blocks these presynaptic M1 receptors. This increases the amount of AChreleased at the SA node and causes bradycardia. Then, the progressive increase in the atropineconcentration blocks the postsynaptic M2 receptors on the SA node (decreasing the ACh release)decreasing the parasympathetic tone, thereby causing tachycardia.",

      "explanation": "Mydriatic action of a muscarinic antagonist is due to the paralysis of the sphincterpupillae (circular) muscle of the iris.In the iris, miosis occurs due to the constriction of the pupillary sphincter muscles and mydriasisis due to the contraction of the dilator pupillae (radial) muscles. They counter-balance each other.When muscarinic antagonists are instilled, the pupillary sphincter muscle is paralyzed, causingmydriasis due to the unopposed contraction of the dilator pupillae muscle.Adrenergic alpha agonists also cause mydriasis, but by mediating the contraction of the dilatorpupillae muscle of iris.Parasympatholytic drugs are classified as:ClassDrugsMuscarinic antagonistsNicotinic antagonistsNmantagonistsNon-depolarizingAtropineScopolamineHomatropineTropicamideIpratropium, TiotropiumDarifenacin, Solifenacin Pirenzipine, TelenzipineGlycopyrrolate UmeclidiniumNnantagonistsTrimethaphanHexamethoniumMecamylamineDepolarizingSuxamethonium DecamethoniumPancuroniumVecuroniumRocuroniumd-tubocurarineMivacuriumAtracurium",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Atropine is substituted by phenylephrine in situations where mydriasis is required withoutcycloplegia, like in fundoscopy.Phenylephrine, an alpha 1 agonist, acts on the radial muscle (dilator pupillae) of the iris andcauses isolated mydriasis. It has no cycloplegic action because sympathetic receptors are presentonly on the iris and not on the ciliary body.124Atropine has both mydriatic and cycloplegic action, which is required for refraction testing.In elderly people who have a low ciliary tone, phenylephrine is preferred as a mydriatic. This isbecause other anticholinergics can precipitate or aggravate glaucoma by relaxation of the ciliarybody and altering the forces acting on trabecular meshwork for aqueous outflow.Atropine, cyclopentolate, and tropicamide are antimuscarinics that are available for ophthalmicuse and cause cycloplegia to a variable extent. This cycloplegia/paralysis of accommodation occursdue to their parasympatholytic action, which decreases the tone of the ciliary body.",

The cycloplegiaproduced by tropicamide is unreliable and insignificant. It is indicated for fundoscopy andrefraction testing in adults who have a relatively low ciliary tone when compared to children.Atropine, which produces complete cycloplegia, is preferred in children as they have a higherciliary tone.

      "explanation": "The use of trospium is contraindicated in urinary retention. It is an antimuscarinic agent and canworsen urinary retention.Muscarinic antagonists are contraindicated in urinary tract obstruction and in benign prostatichyperplasia (or used with extreme caution).Bronchial asthma, hypertension, and peptic ulcer disease are not the contraindications for the useof trospium.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Glycopyrrolate usually does not produce central anticholinergic syndrome. It is a quaternaryamine compound and lipid insoluble. Therefore, glycopyrrolate does not cross the blood-brainbarrier.Non-depolarising skeletal muscle relaxants are used in anesthesia. Neostigmine along withglycopyrrolate are used for reversal of this neuromuscular block. Glycopyrrolate blocks theperipheral muscarinic side effects due to the increased acetylcholine levels after theadministration of neostigmine, without causing unwanted central anticholinergic effects.Peripheral and central anticholinergic syndromes are reactions due to either overdose or anyunusual reaction to the usage of drugs like atropine and other muscarinic agents, phenothiazines,antihistamines, and tricyclic antidepressantsOption B: Atropine is a tertiary compound that can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause centralanticholinergic syndrome.Option C and D: Some of the first-generation antihistamines and tricyclic antidepressants havesignificant anticholinergic activity and can cause central anticholinergic syndrome.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The most commonly used drug in narcoanalysis is pentothal sodium (thiopentone).Other drugs used in narcoanalysis are sodium amytal and secobarbital.Scopolamine hydrochloride was also used in narcoanalysis during World War II. It was popularlyknown as the 'lie detector'. The amnesic and depressant actions of scopolamine are due to theinhibition of the brain cholinergic system. It would put the subject off guard in case of sustainedinterrogation and sleep deprivation, eventually forcing the truth out.128",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Both ipratropium and tiotropium have a minimal inhibitory effect on mucociliary clearance whencompared to atropine. Inhibition of mucociliary clearance by atropine results in accumulation oflower airway secretions and formation of mucus plugs.129",
