      "explanation": "The clinical scenario points towards a diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. Rucaparib is a polyADP-ribose polymerase/ PARP inhibitor approved for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer.PARP is a nuclear protein that transfers ADP-ribose from NAD+ to target proteins and this playsan important role in the DNA damage response. Rucaparib and olaparib are PARP inhibitors.Option A: Palbociclib is a selective inhibitor of the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6. It isused in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.Options C &amp; D: Vorinostat and romidepsin are histone deacetylase inhibitors.",

      "explanation": "Denileukin diftitox is an immunotoxin made from the genetic recombination of IL-2 and thecatalytically active fragment of diphtheria toxin.It is indicated for advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in patients with &gt;20% of T cellsexpressing the surface marker CD25. After binding to the IL-2 receptors, it is internalized byendocytosis. The active fragment of diphtheria toxin then is released into the cytosol, where itinhibits protein synthesis through ADP ribosylation, leading to cell death.Immunotoxins are proteins that contain a toxin along with an antibody that binds specifically totarget cells.Antibody-drug conjugates are complex molecules composed of an antibody linked to a biologicallyactive cytotoxic (anticancer) drug. These antibody-targeted drug therapies are cell-specific to killefficiently the target cells that bind and internalize the drug conjugate. Examples are:••Gemtuzumab ozogamicin - Monoclonal antibody against CD33 linked to a semisyntheticderivative of calicheamicin, a potent antitumor antibiotic. It was approved for the treatment ofacute myeloid leukemia.• Brentuximab vedotin - Anti-CD30 IgG1 monoclonal antibody linked with themicrotubule-disrupting agent MMAE. It is used for the treatment of Hodgkin and anaplasticlymphoma.• Ado-trastuzumab emtansine - It combines the HER2-targeted properties of trastuzumab with theantimicrotubule agent DM1 (derived from maytansine), allowing preferential intracellular drugdelivery to HER2+ cells. It is used in the treatment of HER+ breast cancer.904",
