      "explanation": "Lignocaine decreases the incidence of arrhythmias in patients with suspected MI. However,it increases mortality probably by precipitating heart block or congestive heart failure. Hence it isnot routinely used for prophylaxis in MI patients but it is used only when indicated.Gastrointestinal absorption of lignocaine is good but bioavailability is very less due to highfirst-pass hepatic metabolism. Therefore, it is not used through the oral route.Lignocaine has a high volume of distribution. The loading dose is required to achieve rapidaction.In heart failure, both volumes of distribution and clearance are reduced. Both the loading doseand maintenance dose have to be reduced.227",
