      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The most appropriate first-line antihypertensive among the given drugs is Chlorthalidone. Thiazide diuretics are recommended as one of the first-line antihypertensive drugs for elderly patients without any comorbidities. Among them, guidelines recommend Chlorthalidone over Hydrochlorothiazide because of its longer duration of action. First-choice drugs used in the treatment of hypertension in patients without any comorbidities include: • ACE inhibitors or ARBs: No evidence of superiority of one class over the other. However, ACE inhibitors have a higher risk of side effects like dry cough and angioedema. Calcium channel blockers: Extended-release, long-acting dihydropyridines are preferred. Thiazide diuretics: Chlorthalidone is usually preferred to Hydrochlorothiazide. Loop diuretics like Furosemide and Torsemide are less effective antihypertensives than thiazides. They are not indicated for the routine management of hypertension. In the presence of any associated conditions or comorbidities, the first choice drugs for the treatment of hypertension would be as follows: Comorbidities: Diabetes, Chronic kidney disease with proteinuria, Angina, Heart failure, Benign prostatic hyperplasia, Pregnancy, Atrial fibrillation. First choice drugs for hypertension: ACE inhibitors or ARBs, Beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors and alpha+beta blockers (e.g., Carvedilol), ° 1 blockers, Labetalol, Diltiazem or Verapamil.",

        "D": "Thiazides cause water loss, thereby increasing lithium levels"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Thiazides act by increasing the tubular reabsorption of lithium. Thiazide use is accompanied by sodium loss, which is compensated in a few days by increased reabsorption of Na+ in the proximal tubule. The kidney handles both lithium and Na+ in the same way. Thus, along with Na+ reabsorption, there will be an increase in the reabsorption of lithium also, resulting in decreased excretion of lithium.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Indapamide is a thiazide diuretic that increases K+ excretion, decreasing the risk of hyperkalemia associated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs such as losartan. Option A: Beta-blockers can contribute to K+ retention by decreasing renin release and further reducing aldosterone secretion. Non-selective beta-blockers may also interfere with the cellular uptake of K+ ions. Option B: K+ sparing diuretics like amiloride cause a decrease in K+ excretion and increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Option D: Aliskiren is a direct renin inhibitor and increases the risk of hyperkalemia when combined with losartan.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Long-term reduction of blood pressure by thiazide diuretics is mainly due to a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance. Thiazide diuretics initially decrease extracellular volume by their action on the NaCl transporter in distal convoluted tubules in the nephrons. However, the compensatory response from activation of RAAS raises the extracellular volume to almost pre-treatment levels after a few weeks.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "ACE inhibitors such as captopril or ARBs can be considered as a treatment of choice in hypertensive patients with diabetes because of the renoprotective action. It benefits diabetic patients by reducing the risk of occurrence and progression of diabetic nephropathy. They are also recommended in patients with CKD irrespective of diabetes status as they can delay the progression of nephropathy. Option A: Thiazide diuretics worsen glycemic control and are not preferred in diabetic patients. Option B: Beta-blockers, especially non-selective blockers, worsen glycemic control. Option D: Calcium channel blockers have a neutral effect on glycemic control and can be used in diabetes if ACE inhibitors or ARBs cannot be given.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The best course of action for the patient is close monitoring for any signs or symptoms of hemolysis. The Coombs test is done to test the presence of antibodies against Rh antigens on the red blood cells, which result in hemolysis. A positive Coombs test is seen in 20% of patients who receive methyldopa. However, only 1-5% of such patients develop hemolytic anemia, and hence, a positive Coombs test is not a necessary indication for stopping methyldopa treatment. They must be monitored closely, and any signs that indicate hemolytic anemia need prompt discontinuation of the drug.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Prazosin does not antagonize the effect of clonidine. Prazosin is a selective alpha 1 receptor antagonist, whereas clonidine is an alpha 2 receptor partial agonist. On oral administration, clonidine stimulates alpha 2A receptors in the CNS and results in decreased central sympathetic flow. This causes a decrease in blood pressure. However, on IV administration, postsynaptic alpha 2B receptors are activated at higher doses, which cause a transient rise in blood pressure. It also causes significant reductions in HDL lipids, apolipoproteins AI and AII. It can be combined with vasodilators but has to be used with caution, as potentiation of each other's actions can occur.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Propranolol reduces blood pressure by directly decreasing the heart rate. It is a nonselective beta-blocker and blocks the beta 1 receptor of the heart (SA node), thus reducing the heart rate and blood pressure. It also reduces renin secretion by blocking beta 1 receptors in JG cells. Reduction in renin release also contributes to blood pressure reduction. Option B: Prazosin is a selective alpha 1 blocker and dilates both arteries and veins and may cause reflex tachycardia. Option C: Alpha methyl dopa is a selective alpha 2 receptor agonist. Alpha 2 receptors are autoreceptors present on the presynaptic membrane. On stimulation, central sympathetic discharge is reduced. Alpha methyl dopa can indirectly reduce heart rate.

The drug of choice is IV nicardipine, which acts by calcium channel blockage. Nicardipine blocks the influx of extracellular calcium across the vascular and myocardial smooth muscle cell membranes by blocking the voltage-sensitive calcium channels during depolarization. The decrease in intracellular calcium causes dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries. Other preferred agents for malignant hypertension are clevidipine with labetalol or esmolol.

On prolonged infusion, thiocyanate toxicity can also occur, especially in patients with renal failure.",

      "question": "A patient with gout develops hypertension. The uric acid level was found to be elevated. Which of the following is not administered?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Hydrochlorothiazide",
        "B": "Atenolol",
        "C": "Enalapril",
        "D": "Prazosin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Hydrochlorothiazides are not given to this patient. Gout is a metabolic disease associated with hyperuricemia. Thiazides increase direct urate reabsorption in the proximal renal tubules and are associated with elevated serum uric acid levels and may precipitate gout. Hence, hydrochlorothiazides are not used to treat hypertension in gout patients.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "First-dose phenomenon is characteristic of prazosin and patients must be counseled regarding the effects. Within 30-90 minutes of the initial dose of prazosin or when the dosage is increased, there is marked orthostatic hypotension or syncope. This is known as the first-dose phenomenon. After a few initial doses, tolerance develops to this side effect. Initiating low doses at bedtime is recommended to minimize this phenomenon.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Aluminum hydroxide",
        "B": "Candesartan",
        "C": "Telmisartan",
        "D": "Sucralfate"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Telmisartan can be given safely in a patient with chronic renal failure (CRF) because it is mainly cleared from circulation by biliary excretion. Options A and D: Sucralfate is a basic aluminum salt of sucrose sulfate. Sucralfate, aluminum hydroxide, and magnesium hydroxide in CRF patients can cause the accumulation of Al3+ and Mg2+ ions as they are preferentially excreted via the kidney after systemic absorption. Absorbed Al3+ can contribute to osteoporosis, encephalopathy, and proximal myopathy in CRF patients. Option B: Candesartan is cleared from circulation by renal and biliary excretion. Hence, plasma clearance is affected by renal insufficiency.",
