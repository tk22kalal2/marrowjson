As dose increases, homeostasis is achieved, and the bottom of theU-shaped dose-response curve is reached. As the dose increases to surpass the amount required tomaintain homeostasis, toxicity can ensue.Thus, adverse effects are seen at both low and high doses.46AAdverse responseGraph of Adverse response vs DoseDeathThresholdfor adverseresponseRegion ofhomeostasisDoseMARROWHockey stick-shaped dose-response curve for toxicants that are also metabolic by-products.Dose-response curveResponseAdverseresponsethreshold-DoseOMARROWHockey-stick shapedAdverseresponseInverted U-shaped dose-response curve for ligands that downregulate their receptors.47Dose-response curve - Inverted U-shapedMaximalresponseMARROWDoseOMARROW",

      "explanation": "The area between the dotted lines in the graph shows the therapeutic window. It is the range ofsteady-state concentrations of a drug that provides therapeutic efficacy with minimal toxicity.The therapeutic index (TI) describes a relationship between the doses of a drug that causes lethalor toxic effects with the dose that causes therapeutic effects. It is also called the therapeutic ratio.Mathematically, you can calculate TI by following way:Therapeutic Index = LD50/ED50 (or) Therapeutic Index = TD50/ED50Where,.• LD50 (Median Lethal dose) is the minimum amount of drug that causes adverse effects in 50%of the population. LD50 could also be replaced with Toxic dose (TD50).ED50 (Median Effective dose) is the quantity of a drug that can produce desired therapeuticeffects in 50% of the population.",
