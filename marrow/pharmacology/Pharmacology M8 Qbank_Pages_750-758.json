Inpatients with a previous history of sensitivity to vitamin B12 injections, an intradermal skin test ofcyanocobalamine should be done.",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The absorption of iron is impeded by egg-based foods. They contain a high amount of phosphates(egg yolk) that form complexes with iron and impede absorption.Heme-based iron, present in meat products, is easily absorbed without the aid of a carrier and isnot much affected by other foods. Inorganic iron is affected by several factors.Factors increasing iron absorption are:• Reducing substances such as ascorbic acid and amino acids containing -SH groups - reduceferric iron to the soluble ferrous form• Meat-based foods - enhance heme absorption and increase acid secretion.•Factors decreasing iron absorption are:•Phosphates, phytates, and tetracyclines - by forming complexesAlkalies - prevents the reduction of ferric iron to the soluble ferrous form• Presence of other food in the stomach - by increasing pH",
