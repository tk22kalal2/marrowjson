      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The mechanism of action of vancomycin is cell wall synthesis inhibition.The bacterial cell wall has long chains of peptidoglycan and is cross-linked to each other by theaction of the enzyme transglycosylase. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide group of antibiotics thatbinds to the D-alanyl-D-alanine terminus of the synthesized peptidoglycan. This inhibits thetransglycosylase enzyme and prevents elongation and cross-linking of peptidoglycan. This leads tothe weakening of the cell wall causing lysis.It exhibits a time-dependant or concentration-independent killing of bacteria. It primarily acts onGram +ve organisms which are resistant to other antibiotics such as methicillin-resistantstaphylococcus and ampicillin resistant enterococci.Lipoglycopeptides are a new generation of glycopeptide congeners which include telavancin,dalbavancin, and oritavancin.
