      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Acyclovir can enter CSF as it is widely distributed into all body fluid compartments,including vesicular fluid and aqueous humor. It can be used for treating shingles caused by HZV.Option A: Acyclovir is a guanosine nucleoside congener. The other nucleoside congeners arecidofovir, ganciclovir, and famciclovir.594Option B: Nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, though rare and reversible, are dose-limiting sideeffects of acyclovir.Option C: Acyclovir has a low bioavailability which is overcome by administering valacyclovir, aprodrug with higher bioavailability.Mechanism of action of anti-viral drugs:Mechanism of action of anti-viral drugsNucleosideVirus specific enzymes(eg. thymidine kinase, UL97)Valacyclovir(prodrug)Famciclovir(prodrug)AcyclovirGanciclovirPenciclovirMonophosphateTrifluridineCidofovirMARFoscarnet(Pyrophosphate analog)Host kinasesDiphosphateTriphosphateWDNA polymeraseViral DNAOMARROW",

Treatment should be started ideally within 24 hours ofrash onset.Oral acyclovir (800 mg five times daily) is an alternative drug, but valacyclovir is preferred due toits higher bioavailability and less frequent dosing. In immunocompromised patients, varicellainfection is treated with IV acyclovir.Option A: Oseltamivir is used for the treatment of avian influenza.Option B: Ribavirin is used for treating RSV bronchiolitis.Option D: Ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir are approved for CMV retinitis.",

      "explanation": "Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor.Drugs like oseltamivir and zanamivir competitively and reversibly interact with the enzyme sitesto inhibit viral neuraminidase activity. This interferes with the release of the progeny frominfected host cells, halting the spread of infection.Early administration hastens the resolution of symptoms if given within 48 h of infection.Oseltamivir is given at a dose of 75 mg, twice a day for 5 days for the treatment of influenza A andB.
