      "explanation": "Erenumab-aooe is a calcitonin gene related protein (CGRP) receptor antagonist approved for theprophylaxis of migraine.The pathology of migraine is not completely understood but it includes activation of trigeminalganglion nociceptive neurons and the subsequent release of CGRP from fibers associated withmeningeal vessels. This is believed to mediate vasodilation and mast cell degranulation. Thus,CGRP is involved in the development and maintenance of persistent pain, central sensitizationand allodynia, which are events characteristic of migraine pathology.Blockage of CGRP receptors by CGRP receptor antagonists, causes inhibition of the inflammatoryand nociceptive effects of CGRP at multiple sites within the peripheral and central nervoussystems that are implicated in the underlying pathology of migraine.Monoclonal antibodies that directly inhibit CGRP have also been developed. These include:• Fremanezumab• GalcanezumabNote:The FDA has recently approved Atogepant, a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptorantagonist for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults. The recommended dosageis 10 mg, 30 mg, or 60 mg orally once daily. In severe renal impairment or end-stage renal diseaseit is 10 mg once daily.723",
