      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The positive ionotropic effect of digitalis is due to decreased activity of Na+/Ca2+ exchangercausing a decreased influx of sodium and decreased efflux of Ca2+.Digitalis selectively binds and inhibits the Na+/K+ATPase pump of myocardial fiberswhich normally pushes Na+ outside and brings K+ inside. When this pump is inhibited, there isan intracellular accumulation of Na+ ions. This results in a relative decrease in the expulsion ofCa2+ ions via the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) leading to the accumulation of calcium inside thecells resulting in increased contractility.Mechanism of action of digoxinMyocardial cell+Na+Ca2+3Na+Na+ K+ATPase2K+Ca2+↑ InotropyMARROW178DigoxinNa+",
