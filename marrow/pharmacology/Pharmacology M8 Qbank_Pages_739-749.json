      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Clopidogrel acts by irreversible inhibition of P2Y12 receptors of the platelets.Options B and C: The onset of action is slow (starts after 4 hours) as it requires metabolicactivation by the hepatic CYP2C19 enzyme. Patients with a loss of function mutation ofthe CYP2C19 allele exhibit reduced platelet inhibition and experience a higher rate ofcardiovascular events.Option D: Due to irreversible inhibition of platelet P2Y12 receptors the duration of action is longand lasts for 5-7 days.ClopidogrelPrasugrelTiclopidinePlatelet aggregation disordersAspirinVWFFibrinogenADP receptorGlanzmannArachidonic acidCOXTXA2thrombastheniaGpllb/lllato platelet wallGpllb/IllaAbciximabTirofibanEptifibatideBernard-SouliersyndromeGplbVWFVon WillebranddiseaseSubendothelialcollagenOMARROW",

Since the drug doesnot require hepatic activation, it can be used in patients with CYP2C19 mutations. Ticagrelor ismetabolized into another active metabolite by CYP3A4 and is finally excreted in the urine.Clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticlopidine are irreversible antagonists of P2Y12 and are prodrugsrequiring metabolic activation.",
