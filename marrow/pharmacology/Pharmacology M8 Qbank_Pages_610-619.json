      "question": "A 23-year-old hypothyroid patient taking levothyroxine regularly has now become pregnant.What would your advice be regarding levothyroxine?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Switch to liothyronine as levothyroxine is teratogenic",
        "B": "Increase the dose as pregnancy causes an increased demand for levothyroxine",
        "C": "Continue the same dose but monitor the serum levels on a fortnightly basis",
        "D": "Stop levothyroxine till the end of the first trimester as it has teratogenic potential"
      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The dose of levothyroxine in patients who become pregnant should usually be increased. This isbecause demand for levothyroxine increases in pregnancy and low thyroxine levels are associatedwith adverse fetal outcomes such as mental retardation.The dose of levothyroxine is increased by 30-50% by asking the patient to take 2 extra pills perweek. Increased demand for levothyroxine in pregnancy is due to:• The increased serum concentration of thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) induced by estrogen•Increased expression of type 3 deiodinase in the placenta• A small amount of passage of levothyroxine to the fetusThyroid hormones are not teratogenic. Liothyronine is not preferred in pregnancy because T3 hasa short half-life and requires frequent dosing to limit large fluctuations in levels. In addition,excess T3 often acts to normalize TSH while lowering T4, thereby risking inadequate T4availability to the fetus.",

      "explanation": "Patients who start estrogen therapy will need to increase their thyroid supplementation doses.Estrogens raise the circulating levels of thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), thereby increasing thebound fraction and decreasing the free (bioactive) fraction of circulating thyroxine (T4). As aconsequence, estrogen therapy increases the T4 supplementation requirements of women beingtreated for primary hypothyroidism.Drugs increasing TBG levels:Estrogens• Tamoxifen• Methadone• 5-fluorouracilDrugs decreasing TBG levels:615• Androgens• Corticosteroids• NiacinDrugs decreasing binding of T4 to TBG (by displacement):•Salicylates (aspirin, mefenamic acid)• Heparin• Furosemide",

It occurs rapidly andperiodic monitoring of granulocyte levels is generally ineffective.However, it is reversible on discontinuation of the drug.

      "explanation": "The drug of choice for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis during the first trimester of pregnancy ispropylthiouracil (PTU). It is because it has lower teratogenic effects than carbimazole ormethimazole.Carbimazole and methimazole are associated with teratogenic effects such as:•Aplasia cutis congenita• Choanal atresia• Treacheosopageal fistula••Fetal goiterHowever, propylthiouracil use is limited to the first trimester due to the risk of hepatotoxicity. Itis replaced with carbimazole or methimazole in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of the pregnancy.The lowest effective antithyroid drug dose should be used throughout gestation. This is tomaintain the maternal serum-free T4 level in the upper limit of the non-pregnant normalreference range.Radioiodine therapy is contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Wolff-Chaikoff effect is best described as iodine-induced hypothyroidism.It is a normal, protective downregulation of thyroid hormone synthesis and release via transientinhibition of iodide organification in the presence of an iodine load (exogenous supplementation,iodinated contrast dye, drugs like amiodarone). This occurs in the thyroid gland which is underpituitary control.With persistent high iodine load, an escape phenomenon occurs in normal individuals afteraround 10 days as the iodide levels fall inside the follicle. In autoimmune diseases (Hashimoto's orGrave's), however, the suppression may persist.617The Jod-Basedow phenomenon is iodine-induced hyperthyroidism. It is also seen after an iodineload. However, it is seen in thyroid glands where autoregulation and pituitary control have failed.When exposed to an iodine load in excess, instead of blocking the organification process, thethyroid gland (areas of the autonomously functioning gland) continues to uptake the iodine,producing more thyroid hormone independent of normal regulatory mechanisms. It is seen inendemic goiter, toxic multinodular goiter, thyroid adenoma, and sometimes in Grave's disease.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Lugol's iodine does not augment the uptake of radioactive iodine in the thyroid gland.Radioactive iodine uptake into the thyroid gland is reduced by Lugol's iodine as the uptake isinversely proportional to the serum concentration of stable iodine.Lugol's iodine makes the thyroid gland less vascular and firmer.
