      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "C-peptide can be used to rule out the possibility of factitious hypoglycemia resultingfrom exogenously administered insulin.Endogenous insulin is initially synthesized as preproinsulin that is processed to proinsulin insidebeta cells. Proinsulin is released by secretory granules after processing it to form insulin andC-peptide.Synthetic insulin usually lacks C-peptide, so in factitious hypoglycemia secondary to exogenousinsulin administration, plasma insulin will be elevated, but there will be suppression of C-peptideand proinsulin, and insulin to C-peptide ratio will be greater than one.On the other hand, insulinomas and insulin secretagogues like sulfonylureas stimulateendogenous insulin production. As a result, plasma insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin levels willbe all elevated. The only way to differentiate between insulinoma and insulinsecretagogues-induced hypoglycemia is by detecting the drug, e.g., sulfonylurea, in the blood orurine.665C-peptide has no known physiological function or receptor. It has a half-life of about 30 min.",

Insulin therapy alone in a patient withdiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) may result in hypokalemia.DKA is usually associated with a major K+ deficit. Potassium loss is caused by an extracellularshift of potassium (in exchange with hydrogen ions) due to acidosis. Much of the shiftedextracellular potassium is lost due to emesis and osmotic diuresis.When insulin therapy is initiated for DKA, the serum K+ is shifted intracellularly. Dangeroushypokalemia might occur if K+ supplementation is not initiated subsequently. Insulin should bewithheld if the serum level of potassium is below 3.3 mmol/L.",

This reduces the effectiveness of the insulin dose.Insulin degludec and detemir have a pH of 7.4 that is very near to neutral pH and they do notform such aggregates when mixed with short-acting insulins.But the manufacturers do not advise manual mixing with short-acting insulin as it may alter theactivity profile of the combination that can turn unpredictable.
