      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Metoclopramide enhances gastrointestinal motility.Acetylcholine increases gastrointestinal motility and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) tone.Dopamine which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter suppresses ACh release. This decreasesgastrointestinal motility and LES tone. Therefore, D2 receptor inhibition augments ACh releaseand enhances GI motility and LES tone.The action of metoclopramide is generally confined to the upper digestive tract and an increase incolonic motility is clinically insignificant.",
