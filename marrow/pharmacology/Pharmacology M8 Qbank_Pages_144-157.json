      "explanation": "Timolol is a non-selective beta-blocker. Beta-blockers reduce intra-ocular pressure primarily byreducing aqueous humor production. Another hypothesis states that by reducing ocular bloodflow, there may be a decrease in ultrafiltration responsible for aqueous production.Netarsudil is a rho-kinase inhibitor that acts by increasing trabecular outflow.Brimonidine is an alpha-agonist that has a small effect on increasing both uveoscleral andtrabecular outflow.Latanoprost is a prostaglandin PGF2-alpha analog that primarily acts by releasing matrixmetalloproteinases, thereby increasing trabecular and uveoscleral outflow.",

      "explanation": "Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic having significant anticholinergic action. Drugs havingsignificant anticholinergic action should be avoided or used with extreme caution in patientsprone to developing acute angle-closure glaucoma.The anticholinergic action results in the relaxation of the sphincter pupillae muscle. This results inthe iris coming in contact with the lens and thereby obstructing the movement of the aqueousfrom the posterior to the anterior chamber.This results in bulging of the iris and further leads to the obliteration of the narrow iridocornealangle.
