      "explanation": "Prazosin causes dilation of both arterioles and veins.As a result, both afterload and preload decrease. However, the reflex tachycardia is lesspronounced due to the absence of ° 2 blockade.Prazosin blocks all subtypes of the ° 1 receptor (° 1A, ° 1B, and ° 1D). It also has a beneficial effecton lipid profile as it decreases LDL and triglycerides and increases HDL levels.",

      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of postural hypotension caused by prazosin. These symptoms canbe avoided by using silodosin which has a selective antagonist action on ° 1A receptors over ° 1Breceptors.The prostate stroma has a maximum concentration of ° 1A receptors over other ° 1 receptorsubtypes. ° 1B receptors are present on blood vessels which play a role in vasoconstriction. Hence,selective 1A receptor antagonists have minimal effect on blood pressure as compared tonon-selective ° 1 antagonists like prazosin.○1 receptor antagonists can be classified as:•Selective antagonists• Silodosin (° 1A)• Tamsulosin (° 1A + ° 1D)• Non-selective• Prazosin• Terazosin• Doxazosin• Alfuzosin",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and tamsulosin should begiven to this patient as it has the least effect on blood pressure.It is an ° -blocker that has more selectivity towards ° 1A/1D when compared to ° 1B receptors. Thevasodilatory effects are mainly attributed to the blockade of ° 1B receptors present on bloodvessels.The relief of BPH symptoms is mainly due to the blockade of ° 1A receptors presentpredominantly in the prostatic stroma.

      "explanation": "Retrograde ejaculation is the main side effect of tamsulosin.It is a selective ° 1A/1D blocker and the relief of BPH symptoms is mainly due to blockade of ° 1Areceptors. Blockade of ° 1D receptors present in the bladder relaxes the urethral sphincter, whichis normally closed during ejaculation. This results in the redirection of semen into the urinarybladder.138Silodosin causes ejaculatory dysfunction due to absence of seminal emission.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Propranolol is generally avoided in diabetic patients because it masks the hypoglycaemicsymptoms.Non-selective ẞ blockers interfere with the counter-regulatory hormones secreted duringhypoglycemia, resulting in prolonged hypoglycemia. It also decreases the perception of symptomssuch as tremors, tachycardia, and nervousness. These symptoms are manifested due tostimulation of sympathetic beta receptors in response to hypoglycemia. Blunting of sympatheticresponse results in hypoglycemic unawareness.Cardioselective beta-blockers have relatively lesser interference on the sympathetic response tohypoglycemia and are preferred in diabetic patients.",
