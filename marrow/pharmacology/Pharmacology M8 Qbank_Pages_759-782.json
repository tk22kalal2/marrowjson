      "explanation": "Antithrombin-III is mandatory for the action of heparin as an anticoagulant. Reducedantithrombin levels can lead to resistance.Heparin resistance refers to failure to achieve a therapeutic aPTT with daily doses of heparin of35,000 units or more.In true heparin resistance, there is an actual blunting of heparin's anticoagulant effect. Thisoccurs due to:• Low ATIII levels (most common cause)• Increased heparin-binding plasma proteins (acute phase reactants)• Increased heparin clearance (e.g. due to splenomegaly in liver disease)Low ATIII levels could be due to decreased synthesis (hereditary, hepatic failure), increasedconsumption (DIC, MAHA, or in a bypass circuit) or increased loss (nephrotic syndrome).The dose of heparin has to be increased to achieve therapeutic aPTT.

It binds to acidic heparin withhigh affinity and neutralizes anticoagulant activity. The resultant protamine-heparin complexesare cleared. Protamine binds only to long heparin molecules (UFH). Therefore, protamine onlypartially reverses the activity of LMWH and has no effect on fondaparinux.It is most commonly used to neutralize heparin-induced anticoagulation after separation fromcardiopulmonary bypass. It is also utilized in the setting of dialysis, invasive vascular procedures,and acute ischemic strokes.Note: Protamine sulfate has anticoagulant activity at higher doses and hence, only small amountsof protamine (1mg/100 units of heparin) are used for heparin-induced bleeding.",

Direct thrombininhibitors, such as argatroban is the anticoagulant of choice in HIT.Management of HIT:•Stop heparin/LMWH• Give an alternative anticoagulant, such as lepirudin, argatroban, bivalirudin, fondaparinux orrivaroxaban• Do not give platelet transfusions (it only worsens the consumptive coagulopathy)774• Do not give warfarin until the platelet count returns to its baseline level.

It partiallyreverses the anticoagulant activity of LMWH also. But it has no effect on fondaparinux.There is no known specific antidote approved for use in fondaparinux overdose.Fondaparinux-associated bleeding complications are managed by treatment discontinuation andsearch for the primary cause.

Drugsthat are bound to plasma proteins are lost in the urine. Similarly, warfarin is lost in urine innephrotic syndrome, resulting in a decreased effect.779Option C: Warfarin is mainly metabolized by the CYP2C9 enzyme. In patients being treated withmetronidazole (a CYP2C9 inhibitor), the metabolism of warfarin is decreased.

      "explanation": "Warfarin therapy is usually monitored by measuring prothrombin time.Prothrombin time is sensitive to the reduction in levels of prothrombin, factor VII, and factor X.The test is performed by adding thromboplastin, which is a reagent containing tissue factor,phospholipid and calcium to citrated plasma and determining the time to clot formation.Due to the variable sensitivity of thromboplastin, the International normalized ratio (INR) wasdeveloped to standardize the reporting of prothrombin time. In INR, the patient's prothrombintime is divided by mean normal prothrombin time and this ratio is multiplied by the InternationalSensitivity Index (ISI) of the particular thromboplastin reagent.Warfarin therapy should be monitored with INR every 3-4 weeks. The target INR is 2.0–3.0. Inpatients with mechanical heart valves, the target INR is 2.5–3.5.",

Factor VII may be included or produced separately.Option D: Vitamin K1 is the specific antidote for warfarin-induced bleeding, but it takes 6-24hours for the clotting factors to be resynthesized and released in blood after Vitamin Kadministration and hence its action is delayed for several hours.Option A: Cryoprecipitate mainly contains factor VIII and fibrinogen and therefore is not suitablefor warfarin-induced bleeding, as warfarin inhibits factors II, VII, IX, X.780Option B: Fresh frozen plasma can also be used but prothrombin complex concentrate normalizesthe INR more rapidly.",
