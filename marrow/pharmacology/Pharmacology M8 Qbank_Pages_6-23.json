      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Alkalinization of the urine is done in barbiturate poisoning. When the urine is alkaline, weakly acidic drugs like barbiturates are present in a highly ionized form and excreted more rapidly. When the tubular urine is made more alkaline, weak acids like barbiturates become highly ionized and are excreted to a greater extent. Similarly, acidification of urine increases the excretion of weak bases. This property is used in the management of drug overdose. Drug: Weak acids (e.g., phenobarbital, aspirin), Weak bases (e.g., amphetamine). Treatment of overdose: Alkalinization of urine with sodium bicarbonate, Acidification of urine with ammonium chloride.",

      "explanation": "When the pH = pKa of a drug, the concentration of the drug is 50% ionic and 50% non-ionic. pKa is defined as the pH at which a drug exists as 50% ionized (hydrophilic) and 50% unionized (lipophilic). For example, phenobarbitone is an acidic drug with a pKa of 7.2. At a pH of 7.2, 50% will be unionized. In a more basic plasma (pH = 7.4), a lesser fraction (around 40%) will be unionized. Small changes in pH near the pKa of a drug may cause large variations in the degree of ionization.",

      "explanation": "In a patient with nephrotic syndrome, drug toxicity is least likely with morphine. Acidic drugs generally bind to plasma albumin, while basic drugs bind to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Nephrotic syndrome reduces plasma albumin levels; therefore, there is a decrease in the protein-bound drug fraction and an increase in the free form, resulting in drug toxicity. This is less likely with drugs having low plasma protein binding, such as morphine (only around 35%). Efavirenz, diazepam, and valproate have a very high plasma protein binding of >90% and predominantly bind to albumin and are associated with toxicity in hypoalbuminemia.",

It depends on both the administered site and the drug formulation. This is used to determine the timing of the administration of hypnotics with respect to sleep timings. A hypnotic with a higher rate of absorption might be preferred to induce sleep at a shorter latency as the target concentration can be achieved earlier.",

        "D": "Distributed in extracellular fluid volume"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "In the present case, the volume of distribution of the drug is 6L/kg (420 L in a normal adult with a reference weight of 70kg), which is very high when compared to the total body water of 42L. Therefore, it can be implied that the drug is having high sequestration in tissues. The apparent volume of distribution (Vd) is an imaginary volume throughout which the drug is distributed if the plasma concentration remains constant throughout. Vd = Dose administered IV / plasma concentration. The difference in the volume of distribution based on drug type: \n   • Low Vd: Restricted to the intravascular compartment. Seen in drugs with high molecular weight (e.g., heparin) or high protein binding (e.g., warfarin - 9.8L).\n   • Medium Vd: Lipid-insoluble drugs (e.g., gentamicin - 20L) do not enter the cells and are distributed in the extracellular fluid volume. Small water-soluble molecules (e.g., ethanol - 42L) are distributed in the total body water.\n   • High Vd: Sequestered and accumulated in the tissues. Small lipophilic molecules (e.g., chloroquine - 13000L).",

Two drugs may have the same rate of absorption but a different extent of absorption or bioavailability. The factors upon which the extent of drug absorption depends are: - Lipophilicity: If too lipophilic (e.g., acyclovir), the drug is not soluble enough to cross the water layer adjacent to the cell. - Hydrophilicity: If too hydrophilic (e.g., atenolol), the drug cannot cross the lipid cell membrane.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The volume of distribution of the drug determines the loading dose of the drug. Loading dose is a relatively large dose of the drug given initially to rapidly achieve the target plasma concentration. It is given by the formula: Loading Dose = Volume of Distribution x Desired Steady-state plasma Concentration. The bioavailability determines the route of administration. Though bioavailability may affect the dose necessary, it will not be the primary factor considered during the calculation of the loading dose. Option A: Clearance is used to determine the maintenance dose. Maintenance dose = Clearance x Desired Steady-state plasma concentration.

      "explanation": "Phenytoin kinetics changes from first-order to zero-order kinetics at higher therapeutic levels. True zero-order kinetics is shown only by ethanol. Some drugs have first-order kinetics at low plasma concentrations, while at higher plasma concentrations (within therapeutic range), the mechanism for elimination gets saturated and they change over to zero-order kinetics. Drugs that show early saturation kinetics include: Warfarin, Aspirin, Theophylline, Verapamil, Fluoxetine, and Phenytoin.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Hepatic first-pass metabolism occurs in drugs administered via the oral route. When drugs are given orally, they are absorbed in the intestine and reach the liver through the portal vein. During this process, the drug is acted on by enzymes of the liver and intestine. Additionally, the liver may excrete part of the drug in the bile, further reducing the bioavailability. This is called the first-pass metabolism. In all the other routes, the drug directly enters systemic circulation without reaching the liver. Note: Bioavailability is the fraction of an administered dose of unchanged drug that reaches the systemic circulation. Hence, the bioavailability of a drug administered intravenously (I.V.) is 100%. It is neither subjected to the first-pass metabolism as in the oral route nor does it depend on local factors as in subcutaneous, intramuscular, or transdermal.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Omeprazole is replaced with another proton pump inhibitor (PPI) during coadministration withclopidogrel because of the action on CYP2C19.Clopidogrel is a prodrug that is activated to its active metabolite by the liver enzyme CYP2C19.Apart from CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9 are also involved to a certain extent.Omeprazole serves as both substrate and inhibitor for CYP2C19. It may inhibit the activation ofclopidogrel and decrease its antiplatelet action. Hence, they are not prescribed together.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The subfamily of CYP3A4 is A. In CYP enzymes nomenclature, the root CYP is followed by a number designating the family, a letter denoting the subfamily, and another number designating the gene. Therefore, in CYP3A4: • 3 - family • A - subfamily A • 4 - individual gene coding for one specific isoenzyme. There are numerous CYP isoenzymes in humans. Among them, CYP3A4 is the most abundant and carries out the metabolism of nearly 50% of clinically used drugs.",

      "explanation": "In first order kinetics, a constant fraction of the drug is excreted in a given time.75 mg of 200 mg is excreted in 90 minutes75/200 37.5/100 = 0.375 is eliminated=After 90 minutes; 200 mg-75 mg = 125 mg remainsThe next 90 minutes (after 180 minutes) = 125 x 0.375 = 46.875 mg is eliminated, and 125-46.875= 78.125 mg remainsThe next 90 minutes (after 270 minutes) = 78.125 x 0.375 = 29.297 mg is eliminated, and78.125-29.297 = 48.828 remainsThe next 90 minutes (after 360 minutes) = 48.828 x 0.375 = 18.310 mg is eliminated,48.828-18.310 = 30.518 mg remains after 6 hours.Simpler way to calculate3/8 fraction is excreted in 90 minutes →5/8 remains after 90 minutes.6 hours (360 min) is 4 times of 90 minutes.22So 200 x (5/8)(5/8)(5/8)(5/8) = 30.518 mg remains after 360 minutes23",
