      "question": "A patient with hypercholesterolemia on statin therapy presents to your OPD for follow-up.You notice his cholesterol is still high and decide to add on another drug that directly inhibitsthe absorption of cholesterol. Which of the following will you prescribe?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Ezetimibe",
        "B": "Orlistat",
        "C": "Cholestyramine",
        "D": "Niacin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Ezetimibe is the drug that prevents hypercholesterolemia by directly inhibiting the absorption ofcholesterol.Ezetimibe acts by interfering with a specific cholesterol transport protein NPC1L1 in the intestinalmucosa and reduces the absorption of both dietary and biliary cholesterol. It causesa compensatory increase in hepatic cholesterol synthesis but LDL cholesterol is decreased. Statinsblock this enhanced cholesterol synthesis (cholesterol synthesis inhibitors) and so theircombination has a synergistic effect.Option B: Orlistat is an anti-obesity drug that acts by inhibiting pancreatic and gastric lipase andthus interferes with the digestion and absorption of dietary triglycerides.Option C: Cholestyramine is a bile acid sequestrant. The bile-acid sequestrants are highlypositively charged and bind negatively charged bile acids. Because of their large size, the resinsare not absorbed, and the bound bile acids are excreted in the stool.Cholestyramine primarily reduces LDL levels by increasing hepatic bile acid synthesis; whichresults in increased LDL uptake and diversion of cholesterol to bile acid production.Option D: Niacin reduces lipolysis by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and reduces hepatictriglyceride synthesis.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The drug that decreases Lipoprotein(a) is niacin.Niacin is the only lipid-lowering agent that lowers lipoprotein(a) levels significantly. It also resultsin a decrease in LDL, VLDL, and triglycerides along with an increase in HDL cholesterol.The main adverse effect of niacin is cutaneous flushing and pruritus which can be controlled bypretreatment with aspirin. Niacin can also cause hepatotoxicity, GI toxicity, and hyperuricemia.238",

        "C": "Colestipol",
        "D": "Niacin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Myopathy risk is highest when statins are used along with gemfibrozil.Gemfibrozil is a fibrate that inhibits the uptake of statins into the hepatocytes and prevents itsmetabolism, thereby increasing its bioavailability. Thus, the risk of toxicity of statins increases.Other drugs interacting similarly with statins include:•Cyclosporine•Digoxin• Warfarin•Macrolide antibiotics• Azole antifungals.Option A: Fenofibrate does not have much interaction with statins.Option C: Colestipol is a bile acid sequestrant and does not have much effect on statinmetabolism.Option D: Niacin can also rarely increase the risk of statin-induced myopathy but the risk is muchlower than that with gemfibrozil. So here gemfibrozil is the best answer.",

      "explanation": "Evolocumab is a PCSK-9 inhibitor that is administered as a subcutaneous injection.PCSK-9 is a protease that binds to the LDL receptors on the surface of hepatocyte and enhancesthe lysosomal degradation of the LDL receptor. This results in higher plasma LDL levels.inhibition of PCSK-9 results in a reduction of plasma LDL levels.Two approved PCSK-9 inhibitors are alirocumab and evolocumab.",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitor is lomitapide.MTP adds triglycerides to nascent VLDL in the liver and to chylomicrons in the intestine. Itsinhibition decreases VLDL secretion and thus decreases the accumulation of LDL in the plasma. Itis approved for use in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.Options A: Ticlopidine is an antiplatelet agent.Option B: Gugulipid is a plant extract that is commonly used for hyperlipidemia but has verylittle/no evidence to support its use.239Option D: Evinacumab is a recently approved angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) inhibitor. It isindicated as an adjunct to other LDL-cholesterol lowering therapies for homozygous familialhypercholesterolemia in adults and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older.",

Fibrates bind to PPAR alphaand cause stimulation of lipoprotein lipase enzyme. Increased LPL synthesis enhances theclearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.
