      "explanation": "GH deferral is only recommended for the first year after treatment of leukemia.605Because of the anti-insulin action of GH, there is an increased incidence of type 2 diabetes.mellitus and therefore, fasting glucose levels should be monitored periodically during GHtherapy. Due to the rare potential for developing intracranial hypertension, fundoscopicexamination is recommended at the initiation of therapy and at periodic intervals thereafter.Rapid growth induced by GH can cause slipped epiphyses or scoliosis in children.Estrogens (OCPs and estrogen supplements) inhibit GH action so that a larger dose is needed tomaintain the same IGF-1 level.The adverse effects of growth hormone are:ChildrenAdultsIntracranial hypertension Increased risk oftype 2 diabetesSlipped epiphysisScoliosisPeripheral edemaCarpal tunnel syndrome ArthralgiasMyalgia",

Cabergoline is preferred overbromocriptine for hyperprolactinemia due to lower adverse effects such as nausea and also due todosing advantage (twice a week instead of daily dosing).Lisuride is indicated in early Parkinson's disease but is also known to decrease prolactin levelsand prevent migraine attacks. Apomorphine is a morphine derivative used to treat hypomobile\"off\" episodes of advanced Parkinson's disease.",

It is a somatostatin analog thatreduces azygous blood flow significantly and decreases variceal bleeding.Other drugs that can be used for the management of bleeding esophageal varices:• Terlipressin• Vasopressin• PropranololOption A: Desmopressin is a selective V2 receptor agonist used for central diabetes insipidus andnocturnal enuresis.Option B: Propranolol (non-selective beta-blocker) is used in the prophylaxis of variceal bleedingand not in its acute management.Option D: Terlipressin is a vasoconstrictor used for bleeding esophageal varices but maycompromise cardiac function and induce ischemia and hence can't be used in this case.Note: Although terlipressin is a vasoconstrictor and is be used for bleeding oesophagal varices, thepatient in this scenario has a history of MI (undergone coronary bypass surgery). Terlipressin cancompromise cardiac function (reduces cardiac output and ejection fraction) and induce ischemia.Hence, it is not preferred in this case.",
