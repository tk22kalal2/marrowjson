      "options": {
        "A": "Naltrexone is an antagonist at μ receptor",
        "B": "Meperidine is a pure agonist at μ receptor",
        "C": "Nalbuphine is an agonist at k receptor",
        "D": "Butorphanol is an antagonist at k receptor"

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Butorphanol is an agonist at к receptor. It may be a partial agonist or antagonist at µ receptor.Pentazocine, butorphanol, buprenorphine, meptazinol, nalorphine, nalbuphine, and dezocine aremixed agonist-antagonist opioids.All opioid agonist-antagonists are μ antagonists and k agonists, except buprenorphine,pentazocine, and dezocine. Buprenorphine, pentazocine, and dezocine are partial agonists at thereceptor.Option A: Naltrexone is a pure antagonist at µ, k, and § receptors.Option B: Meperidine is a pure agonist of both µ and к receptors.u387",
