      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Tensor veli palatini helps in opening the Eustachian tube during the Valsalva maneuver. It is closed at rest and opens intermittently during swallowing, yawning, and sneezing. Opening of the tube: The medial fibers of the tensor veli palatini are attached to the lateral lamina of the tube and contract to open the tubal lumen. It is also called the dilator tubae muscle. Accessory muscles for opening are levator veli palatini and salpingopharyngeus. Closure of the tube: It is mainly due to the elastic recoil of the cartilage aided by the high degree of elastin on the roof. Ostmann's pad of fat helps to keep the tube closed.",

      "explanation": "The Eustachian tube in children is wider, shorter (13-18mm), and more horizontal. Thecartilaginous part is flaccid due to less elastin.The above differences make children more prone to retrograde reflux of nasopharyngealsecretions and middle ear infections.

      "explanation": "247Cleft palate is a cause for functional Eustachian tube (ET) obstruction.Eustachian tube obstruction can be mechanical, functional or both. Mechanical obstruction canresult from intrinsic causes such as inflammation or allergy or extrinsic causes such as tumour oradenoids. Functional obstruction is caused by collapse of the tube due to increased cartilagecompliance or failure of active tubal opening mechanism due to poor function of tensor velipalatini.In the cleft palate, the obstruction is due to high elastin content at torus tubaris and the poorfunction of tensor veli palatini.",

      "explanation": "The given image depicts the Valsalva manoeuvre and it builds up positive pressure in thenasopharynx and not negative pressure.In this test, the patient is asked to close the mouth and nostrils and blow. This produces positivepressure within the nasopharynx which opens the patent eustachian tube and is confirmed by thetympanic membrane bulge via otoscopy.It is used to assess the Eustachian tube patency and to auto-inflate the middle ear.It is contraindicated in:•Atrophic tympanic membrane as it might get ruptured.•URTI as the infection can spread into the middle ear.248",

      "explanation": "The procedure depicted in the image is Eustachian tube (ET) catheterization and it uses Politzer'sbag and an ET catheter.The catheter is passed along the nasal floor and manoeuvred into the ET opening and the bag isinsufflated. The outward movement of the tympanic membrane is then noted with an otoscope.It is an unsafe and outdated ET function test. It can lead to complications like TM rupture,scarring of ET, epistaxis, spread of nasal/pharyngeal infection to the middle ear.In the methylene blue dye test, the dye is instilled into the middle ear and the time taken by it tostain the pharynx is noted.Politzer test is a non-invasive alternative for this and works on the same principle. It uses a nasalolive instead of a catheter and is useful in children who can't perform the Valsalva or Toynbeetest.",
