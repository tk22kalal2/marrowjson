In most cases, thedeformity is due to edema. So, ice packs and head elevation are advised initially after injury. After3-5 days, the edema would subside and the underlying deformity will be apparent on clinicalassessment.After 2 weeks it is difficult to reduce since the process of callus formation and the bony andfibrous union would have started.",
