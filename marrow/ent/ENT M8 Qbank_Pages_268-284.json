      "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes a patient with post-pregnancy hearing loss. The audiogram showsconductive deafness along with Carhart's notch (dip in bone conduction at 2000 Hz). Thesefindings are highly suggestive of otosclerosis.Ototoxicity, Meniere's disease, and noise-induced hearing loss cause sensory neural hearing loss(SNHL) and not conductive hearing loss.Otosclerosis is caused by bony overgrowth involving the enchondral layer of the bony otic capsule.It presents with bilateral progressive conductive hearing loss and tinnitus. It has an autosomaldominant inheritance and can worsen with stress and hormonal changes like during pregnancyand menopause.Stapedial otosclerosis is the most common type of otosclerosis. Here the lesion starts just in frontof the oval window in an area called fistula ante fenestrae.The presence of a reddish hue on the promontory through the tympanic membrane, known as theSchwartze sign, suggests an active focus. PTA shows loss of air conduction with air-bone gap,more for lower frequencies and Carhart's notch may be seen. Tympanometry shows an As type oftympanogram in which there is reduced compliance at or near the ambient air pressure.Medical management with sodium fluoride is used in the active stage. Definitive treatment isstapedectomy/stapedotomy with the placement of a prosthesis. Carhart notch usually disappears278after a successful stapedectomy.Other options:Option A: Ototoxicity causes SNHL and shows a high-frequency hearing loss in the SNHL curve.Option B: In Meniere's disease, pure tone audiometry shows an SNHL pattern with a rising curvein the early stages (as lower frequencies are involved first) and as the disease progresses higherfrequencies are involved, the curve becomes flat or a falling type.Option D: Noise-induced hearing loss is SNHL and PTA shows a characteristic acoustic dip at4000 Hz both for air and bone conduction.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "In caloric testing, cold water irrigation produces horizontal nystagmus towards the opposite side of irrigation. The direction of nystagmus can be remembered by the mnemonic, COWS (cold-opposite, warm-same). The mechanism for the nystagmus is the creation of a temperature gradient by the cold water, which pulls the cupula away from the utricle, causing nystagmus towards the opposite side. As the horizontal semicircular canal is closer to the outer ear canal, most of the response comes from it and the nystagmus is horizontal. The Fitzgerald-Hallpike test (bithermal caloric test) is done to assess this phenomenon. The patient lies in a supine position with head tilted forward at a 30° angle, ensuring the horizontal canal becomes vertical. Alternatingly, water at temperatures of 30°C and 44°C (7° below and above normal body temperature, respectively) is irrigated into the ears for a duration of 40 seconds each. The examiner closely observes the patient's eyes for the emergence of nystagmus until its endpoint is reached. The time taken from the start of irrigation to the endpoint of nystagmus is recorded and plotted on a calorigram. If no nystagmus is evoked from either ear, the test is repeated with water at a temperature of 20°C for a duration of 4 minutes before labeling the labyrinth dead. A 5-minute interval should be allowed between testing each ear to ensure accurate results.",
