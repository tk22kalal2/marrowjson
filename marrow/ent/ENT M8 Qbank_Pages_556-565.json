      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Glottic carcinoma presents with hoarseness of voice as its earliest symptom. Lesions of the vocalcords affect its vibratory capacity. Therefore they are diagnosed early and have a better prognosis.Supraglottic and subglottic growths are often silent. Hoarseness is a late symptom.",

        "D": "Phonotrauma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Phonotrauma is not the reason behind the development of hoarseness of voice in laryngeal carcinoma. It occurs due to overuse of the voice and is associated with the development of benign lesions, such as vocal nodules and cysts. Hoarseness in supraglottic cancer and subglottic cancer indicates spread of disease to: vocal cords with infiltration of the thyroarytenoid muscle, involvement of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and cricoarytenoid joint involvement. Hoarseness in glottic carcinoma is early because lesions of the cord affect its vibratory capacity.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Tumours limited to the glottis usually do not spread to any lymph node station as there are nolymphatics in the vocal cords.However, if the tumour invades the supra- or the infra- glottic spaces, lymph node spread canoccur.Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignant tumour of the larynx. Glottis is the mostcommon site of cancer.560",

      "explanation": "Hoarseness of voice is a late symptom of supraglottic carcinoma.The most common site of supraglottic carcinoma is the epiglottis followed by false cords and thenaryepiglottic folds. Nodal metastases occur early to the upper and middle jugular lymphnodes. Bilateral metastases can be seen in cases of epiglottic cancer.

      "explanation": "Endoscopic resection with CO2 laser is most commonly used in laryngeal surgeries.Carcinoma of the mobile membranous vocal cords can be precisely excised with the CO2 laserunder the microscope.

      "explanation": "Tumour limited to both vocal cords with normal mobility can be classified as stage T1b. Treatment will include radiotherapy or transoral laser microsurgery. There is no indication for a total laryngectomy. Total laryngectomy is indicated in: • All T4 lesions • Invasion of thyroid or cricoid cartilage • Bilateral arytenoid cartilage involvement • Lesions of the posterior commissure • Failure after radiotherapy or conservation surgery • Transglottic cancers with cord fixation. It is contraindicated in patients with distant metastasis. Treatment of T3 cancers is controversial; open vertical hemilaryngectomy and more extensive partial laryngectomies are used in carefully selected cases. Total laryngectomy or CRT is recommended for bulky T3 tumors or tumors not suitable for conservation laryngeal surgery.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Laryngeal carcinoma is an indication of high tracheostomy. It is done at the level of the 1sttracheal ring and an opening is made above the isthmus of the thyroid gland.564The disadvantage of a high tracheostomy is subglottic stenosis at the level of the cricoid andperichondritis of the cricoid. However, in laryngeal carcinoma this would be a temporary measureas the definitive management is total laryngectomy.Tracheostomy involves making an opening and placing a stoma in the anterior wall of thetrachea.Functions:••Provides an alternative pathway for breathing by bypassing the obstruction.Improves alveolar ventilation by reducing dead space by 30-50% and reducing airway resistance• Uses a cuff to protect the airways from secretions and blood• Allows suction of secretions in the setting of the impaired cough reflex..Allows positive pressure respiration• Allows administration of anesthesiaIndications:•Respiratory obstruction due to• Infections (laryngo-tracheo-bronchitis, epiglottitis).•Trauma due to external injury, mandibular or maxillofacial fractures• Neoplasms• Foreign bodies or edema• Bilateral abductor paralysis•Congenital anomalies• Retained secretions•⚫ Inability to cough due to coma, spasm, or paralysis of respiratory muscles•Aspiration of pharyngeal secretions• Painful cough•Respiratory insufficiency due to emphysema, chronic bronchitis565",
