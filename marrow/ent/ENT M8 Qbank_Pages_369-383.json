Clinical features of DNS: • Nasal obstruction - unilateral in C-shaped deviation and bilateral in S-shaped deviation • Headache - may be due to associated sinusitis or due to spur pressing on the lateral wall of the nose • Sinusitis - due to obstruction of ostia and poor ventilation of sinuses • Epistaxis - from vessels over spur or due to crusting of the nasal mucosa • Compensatory hypertrophy of turbinates on the roomier side • Anosmia - especially in bilateral nasal obstruction. Frequent middle ear infections • Association with external deformities",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The clinical test depicted in the image is Cottle's test, where the cheek is drawn laterally while the patient breathes quietly. This test is used to assess the patency of the nasal valve in patients with a deviated nasal septum. If the nasal airway improves on the test side, the test is positive and indicates an abnormality of the vestibular component of the nasal valve on that side. Option A: Epley's maneuver is used in the treatment of BPPV. Epley's maneuver: return the patient to an upright, seated position with the neck flexed for 20-30 seconds. With the patient seated on the table, turn the head 45° toward the affected side while extending the neck. Lay the patient down, keeping the head rotated and extend the neck 10° to 20°, depending on the patient's ability and comfort. Hold this position for 20-30 seconds or until nystagmus ceases. Turn the head another 90°, rolling the body toward the unaffected side. Hold this position for 20-30 seconds or until nystagmus or vertigo ceases. Turn the head 90° toward the unaffected side. Hold this position for 20-30 seconds or until nystagmus or vertigo ceases. Option B: Heimlich maneuver is used in the treatment of accidental inhalation of a foreign body. Procedure: stand behind the person and place your arms around their lower chest and give four abdominal thrusts. The residual air in the lungs can dislodge the foreign body, providing some airway. Option D: Trotter's method is used in the treatment of epistaxis. In Trotter's method, the patient is made to sit, leaning a little forward over a basin to spit any blood. They should pinch the nose firmly for 5 to 10 minutes and breathe quietly from the mouth.",
