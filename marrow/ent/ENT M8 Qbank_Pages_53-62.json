      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The mastoid antrum is the largest mastoid air cell. It is the most constant mastoid air cell because it is present even in a sclerotic mastoid. The attic, or the epitympanum, is the part of the middle ear adjacent to its roof. Aditus ad antrum is the pathway or the connection between the mastoid antrum and the attic.",

      "explanation": "Macewen's (suprameatal) triangle is used as a surgical landmark to locate the mastoid antrum. In an adult, the antrum lies 12–15 mm from the surface. This triangle is also the site of tenderness in acute mastoiditis. Macewen's (suprameatal) triangle, Suprameatal triangle of MacEwen, Mastoid process, Spine of Henle-Styloid process.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The mandible is not a pneumatic bone. Some bones of the skull, notably the mastoid process of the temporal bone and the paranasal sinuses of the frontal, maxilla, sphenoid, and ethmoid bones, have many of the internal cavities filled with air, i.e., they are variably pneumatized. The maxillae are the largest of the pneumatized bones of the midface. They contain the maxillary air sinuses and bear the upper teeth. The mastoid consists of a bone cortex with a 'honeycomb' of air cells underneath.",

      "question": "You are evaluating a patient with a past history of chronic suppurative otitis media. The CT is suggestive of sclerosis and loss of aeration of mastoid air cells. What is this type of mastoid pneumatization called?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The type of mastoid pneumatization in the given clinical scenario is acellular or sclerotic mastoid. Here, sclerosis and loss of aeration of mastoid air cells are seen. Sclerotic mastoids contain only the mastoid antrum, which is small with an anteposed sigmoid sinus. It can occur due to Eustachian or middle ear disease in childhood, preventing mastoid development. Other types of mastoid pneumatization: well-pneumatized or cellular - contains multiple air spaces; diploetic - contains air cells and marrow spaces.",

        "C": "Parietal",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The parietal is not a part of the temporal bone. The temporal bone consists of the following parts: Squamous part - anterosuperiorly. It articulates with the parietal bone. The persistence of petrosquamous suture is called Korner's septum. Mastoid part - posteroinferiorly. Its outer surface forms a conical projection called the mastoid process. Sternocleidomastoid, splenius capitis, and longissimus capitis attach here. Petrous part - medially. The arcuate eminence is related to the superior semicircular canal below. The posterior surface contains the internal auditory meatus (IAM). The vestibular aqueduct is present behind the IAM. The inferior surface contains the carotid canal and the jugular fossa (jugular notch). Tympanic part - centrally. It contains the external auditory meatus (EAM), and the bony EAM is 16 mm long. The suprameatal triangle is present above the EAM. Styloid process - anteroinferior; it gives attachment to: three muscles - stylohyoid, styloglossus, stylopharyngeus; two ligaments - stylohyoid ligament, stylomandibular ligament. The temporal bone gives the zygomatic process, which articulates with the temporal process of the zygomatic bone to form the zygomatic arch.",

        "D": "Sigmoid sinus and tegmen"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Citelli's angle or sinodural angle is the angle between the sigmoid sinus plate and tegmen or dural plate. The boundaries of cortical mastoidectomy are: Tegmen plate superiorly, Sigmoid sinus plate posteriorly, and posterior bony external auditory canal wall anteriorly. This is also called the triangle of attack. Image showing sinodural angle: Mastoid tegmen, Sigmoid sinus, Sinodural angle. Patel, Carlson. 3D Temporal Bone Atlas @headmirror.com",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Donaldson's line is the surgical landmark to locate the endolymphatic sac. It is an imaginary line drawn from the horizontal semicircular canal, which bisects the posterior semicircular canal. The endolymphatic sac lies just below it.

      "options": {
        "A": "Anterior cranial fossa",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Trautmann's triangle is a landmark to approach the posterior cranial fossa. It is a triangular area on the medial wall of the mastoid antrum. It is bounded superiorly by the dura or superior petrosal sinus, posteriorly by the sigmoid sinus, and anteriorly by the bony labyrinth. Since here the bone is thin, it can lead to the spreading of infections from the mastoid to the cerebellum.
