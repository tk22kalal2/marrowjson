      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The structure marked A is the adenoids. It is not surrounded by a capsule.Adenoids are comprised of vertical ridges of lymphoid tissues separated by deep clefts. They formthe superior aspect of Waldeyer's ring. They have no crypts and no capsule, unlike palatine tonsilswhich have both.It is present at birth, enlarges up to the age of 6 years, and then starts regressing from puberty. Itcompletely disappears by the age of 20 years.",

      "explanation": "The given x-ray shows enlarged adenoids and suggests the diagnosis of adenoid hypertrophy.Patients show an absent nasolabial fold.Clinical features:• Nasal obstruction is the most common symptom. This leads to mouth breathing. Nasalobstruction also interferes with feeding or suckling in a child. As respiration and feeding cannottake place simultaneously, a child with adenoid enlargement fails to thrive.• Nasal discharge, sinusitis, and epistaxis.• Bilateral conductive hearing loss and serous otitis media due to eustachian tube obstruction.• Rhinolalia clausa - hyponasal voice.• Adenoid facies - elongated face with a dull expression, pinched up nose, absent nasolabial crease,open mouth, prominent and crowded upper teeth.•Sleep apnoea - chronic cases lead to hypoxemia and pulmonary vasoconstriction. Thisconsequently leads to pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale.•Aprosexia lack of concentration.455Idiotic appearance-Pinched nose-Shallow naso-labial furrowsCrowded teethOpen mouthHyperplasia ofGumDribbling of salivafrom angle ofmouthAdenoidTonsil",

Rhinolalia clausa/ hyponasal voice can be seen in these patients.It is also seen in conditions like common cold, nasal allergy, etc.-Option A Hot potato voice is a muffled and thick speech often seen in a peritonsillar abscess(quinsy).Option C - Rhinolalia aperta causes a hypernasal voice.Option D - Staccato voice or scanning speech is a broken speech seen in cerebellar lesions as wellas multiple sclerosis.456",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Beta 2 agonists have no role in conditions of upper airway obstruction like adenoidhypertrophy. They are bronchodilators used in lower airway obstructive diseases.When symptoms of adenoid hypertrophy are not marked, breathing exercises, decongestant nasaldrops, and antihistamines for any coexisting nasal allergy can cure the condition without resortingto surgery.Marked adenoid hypertrophy with associated complications can be treated with adenoidectomyand grommet insertion.",

Indications of adenoidectomy: • Adenoid hypertrophy causing snoring, mouth breathing, sleep apnea syndrome or speech abnormalities, i.e., (rhinolalia clausa) • Recurrent rhinosinusitis • Chronic otitis media with effusion associated with adenoid hyperplasia • Recurrent ear discharge in benign CSOM associated with adenoiditis/adenoid hyperplasia • Dental malocclusion. Adenoidectomy does not correct dental abnormalities but will prevent its recurrence after orthodontic treatment.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Cleft palate is a contraindication to performing adenoidectomy as removal of adenoids causes velopharyngeal insufficiency. Velopharyngeal insufficiency is a condition where the soft palate does not close tightly against the back of the throat. This leads to air coming out the nose (characterized by hypernasality) during speech. Contraindications for adenoidectomy: • Cleft palate or submucous palate. • Hemorrhagic diathesis. • Acute infection of the upper respiratory tract.",

      "explanation": "Grisel syndrome involves paraspinal muscle spasm that occurs post adenoidectomy.Grisel syndrome refers to non-traumatic atlantoaxial joint subluxation. The patient complains ofneck pain and develops torticollis. It is mostly due to spasm of paraspinal muscles but can also bedue to atlantoaxial dislocation requiring cervical collar and even traction.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Thornwaldt cyst is located in the midline of the posterior wall of the nasopharynx in the adenoid mass. It is an epithelial-lined median recess found within the adenoid mass and extends from pharyngeal mucosa to the periosteum of the basiocciput. It represents the attachment of the notochord to the pharyngeal endoderm during embryonic life. When infected, it may be the cause of persistent postnasal discharge or crusting. Sometimes an abscess can form in the bursa (Thornwaldt's disease). It is managed surgically by marsupialization of the swelling and complete removal of the lining of the cyst.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Antitubercular treatment has no role in the treatment of Thornwaldt's abscess. Thornwaldt's abscess is formed due to the infection of Thornwaldt cyst. Treatment includes administration of antibiotics to treat the infection and marsupialization of the cystic swelling. There should be adequate removal of its lining membrane.",
