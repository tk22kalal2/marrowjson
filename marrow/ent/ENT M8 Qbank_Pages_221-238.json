      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Right upper motor neuron (UMN) facial nerve palsy causes paralysis of lower facial muscles onthe left side.The upper part of the facial nerve's motor nucleus, which innervates forehead muscles, receivesfibers from both the cerebral hemispheres. The lower part of the nucleus, which supplies thelower face, only receives crossed fibers from the contralateral hemisphere. Therefore, the upperpart of the face gets bilateral innervation and the lower part of the face gets crossed innervationfrom the opposite side.Hence, in supranuclear lesion (UMN palsy), forehead is spared and muscles of the lower half ofthe opposite side of the face are affected.In LMN palsy, all muscles of the same side are affected.229Drooping ofangle of mouthFacial Nerve PalsySupranuclearlesionFacial nerveDeviation ofangle of mouthSupranuclear lesion/UMN lesionBNucleus offacial nerveLesion infacial nerveFacial nerve lesion/LMN lesion (Bell's palsy)OMARROW",

It is the first branch given at the level of the geniculate ganglion.Injury to the nerve to stapedius, the first motor branch of the facial nerve, leads to loss ofstapedial reflex and hyperacusis, which can be detected by tympanometry.Injury to chorda tympani nerve leads to loss of taste from anterior 2/3rd of the tongue which isdetected by electrogustometry and reduced submandibular and sublingual salivary flow detectedby salivary flow test.So in this patient, the lesion is proximal to the origin of nerve to stapedius i.e. tympanic segment,and not proximal to geniculate ganglion as the lacrimation is normal.233",
