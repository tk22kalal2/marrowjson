      "explanation": "Allergic rhinitis is an IgE-mediated immunologic response of nasal mucosa to airborne allergens. Patients typically present with recurrent bouts of sneezing, nasal obstruction, watery nasal discharge, and itching, and clinical signs include allergic shiners (dark circles around the eyes) and allergic salute (a black transverse nasal crease on the dorsum of the nose due to repeated upward rubbing). Treatment options include: • Avoidance of the allergen • Treatment with drugs like oral antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids, intranasal cromolyn sodium • Immunotherapy is through the delivery of allergen in gradually increasing doses until the maintenance dose is reached. It suppresses the development of IgE. It has to be given for a year to see significant improvement in symptoms. Intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) remain the preferred monotherapy for persistent allergic rhinitis (AR). However, additional studies support the additive benefit of combination treatment with INCS and intranasal antihistamines in AR. For patients receiving INCS, an intranasal decongestant may be added to the treatment for up to 4 weeks.",

During this time, the mucosa becomes normal, and thecrusting is reduced.In Modified Young's operation, the procedure has been modified to avoid discomfort fromcomplete closure of the nostrils. Here the nostrils are only partially closed.

Roomy nasal cavities with foul-smelling crusts are seen. The patient presentswith a foul smell from the nose, marked anosmia (merciful anosmia), and paradoxical nasalobstruction (nasal obstruction despite wide nasal passages). Paradoxical nasal obstruction occursdue to degenerative changes in the sensory nerves of the nasal mucosa, leading to an inability tosense airflow.Medical management includes nasal irrigation and removal of crusts. 25% glucose in glycerine,antibiotics (quinolones or metronidazole), estradiol nasal spray, and mucolytics can be used.368",
