      "question": "A 25-year-old patient is to undergo mastoid surgery. Which of the following instruments will not be present in the operation theatre?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Lempert's curette",

        "D": "Lempert's trocar"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Lempert's trocar does not exist. Option A: Lempert's curette (scoop) is used for removal of bony septa and granulations in mastoid surgery. Lempert's curette is used for this purpose. Option B: Lempert's endaural retractor is used for endaural approach to ear surgery. It has two lateral blades which retract the flaps and a third central blade with holes. The central blade retracts the temporalis muscle. The central blade can be fixed to the body of the retractor by its hole. Lempert's endaural retractor is used in this manner. Option C: Lempert's endaural speculum is used to spread open the meatus when giving the local injection or making an endaural incision. Lempert's endaural speculum is utilized for this purpose. Lempert's incision is used in endaural approach. It consists of two parts: Lempert I: It is a semicircular incision, made from 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock position in the posterior meatal wall at the bony-cartilaginous junction. Lempert II: Starts from the first incision at 12 o'clock and then passes upwards in a curvilinear fashion between tragus and the crus of helix. It passes through the incisura terminalis and thus does not cut the cartilage. Both mastoid and external canal surgery can be done.",

      "explanation": "The image is of a tympanometer. It is used in evaluating the status of the middle ear.It is based on a simple principle that when a sound strikes the tympanic membrane, some of thesound energy is absorbed while the rest is reflected. A stiffer tympanic membrane would reflectmore sound energy than a compliant one.By charting the compliance of the tympano-ossicular system against various pressure changes,different types of graphs called tympanograms are as follows:ComplianceType AType AsType ADType BType CTypes of tympanogramNormal tympanogram.Compliance is lower at or near ambient airpressure. Seen in fixation of ossicles,e.g. otosclerosis or malleus fixation.High compliance at or near ambient pressure.Seen in ossicular discontinuity or thin and laxtympanic membrane.A flat or dome-shaped graph. No change incompliance with pressure changes. Seen inmiddle ear fluid or thick tympanic membrane.Maximum compliance occurs with negativepressure in excess of 100 mm H20.
