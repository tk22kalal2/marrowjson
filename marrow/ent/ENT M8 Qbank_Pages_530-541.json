      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The clinical picture and omega-shaped epiglottis are suggestive of laryngomalacia. Conservative treatment is preferred for laryngomalacia as this condition self-corrects by two years of age. Tracheostomy may be required for some cases of severe respiratory obstruction. Supraglottoplasty is required in severe laryngomalacia. Signs of severe laryngomalacia include: • Difficulty feeding • Increased effort in breathing • Poor weight gain • Pauses in breathing • Frequent spitting up",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Myer Cotton's grading is used for subglottic stenosis. It is the abnormal thickening of cricoid/fibrous tissue proliferation below cords. It causes the airway to narrow and presents with dyspnea, biphasic stridor, and a normal cry. Diagnosis: In full-term infants, subglottic diameter <4mm. In premature infants, subglottic diameter <3mm. The Myer Cotton's grading system allows to stratify the stenosis and plan for treatment: Grade 1: <50% stenosis, Grade 2: 51-70% stenosis, Grade 3: 71-99% stenosis, Grade 4: No lumen detected. Other options: Option A - Hyams grading is a predictive tool used in olfactory neuroblastoma. Option B - House Brackmann grading is used as a facial nerve grading system. Option D - Modified Mallampati classification is used to assess difficult airway.",

It is an abnormal dilation of the laryngealsaccule and extends beyond the thyroid cartilage and the ventricle.537It is seen in trumpet players, glass-blowers, or weight lifters due to raised transglottic air pressure.It can be internal, external, or combined. External laryngocele presents as a reducible swelling inthe neck which increases in size on coughing or performing Valsalva maneuver.Internal laryngocele is managed by marsupialization.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The given clinical picture is of congenital subglottic hemangioma. Embolization is not preferred in congenital laryngeal conditions. All congenital laryngeal conditions tend to regress with growth. The principal management is conservative as many hemangiomas involute spontaneously. Depending on the status of the airway, treatment can involve: to wait and watch, steroid therapy, tracheostomy and observation. If the condition does not regress with time, the modalities of treatment include: LASER excision, laryngofissure and excision, and pexy and plasty procedures (epiglottopexy, supraglottoplasty, etc.)",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The image showing grape-like projections, involving the anterior part of the vocal cords depictsa laryngeal papilloma.Laryngeal papilloma is a benign tumor of the larynx caused by the human papillomavirus (HPVtype 6 and 11). They can occur in children, most commonly around 3-5 years of age (juvenilepapillomatosis), as well as in adults. They involve the supraglottic and glottic regions of thelarynx. Seeding of the lesions can occur during invasive laryngeal procedures, such as intubation.They have a high recurrence rate and very low potential for malignancy.Adult-onset laryngeal papillomatosis is less common and usually seen in males aged 30-50 years.It is less aggressive and involves the anterior part of the vocal cords. The treatment is the same asjuvenile papillomatosis.Patients present with hoarseness, aphonia, dyspnea, or stridor. Laryngoscopy shows pinkish towhite grape-like projections that can be sessile or pedunculate with a visible central vascularcore. The diagnosis is confirmed by direct laryngoscopy and biopsy. Treatment consistsof micro-laryngoscopy and CO2 laser excision.The image below depicts laryngeal papillomatosis on laryngoscopy:Reinke's edema (Option A) is a collection of fluid in the subepithelial space of Reinke. It generallyoccurs in patients with vocal abuse or smoking. The vocal cords will show diffuse, symmetricalswelling.The laryngoscopic image below shows Reinke's edema:53965Hz 51dB",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of a child presenting with chronic hoarseness (3 months) of voice andrespiratory distress for 2 weeks suggests the diagnosis of respiratory papillomatosis (juvenilepapillomatosis).Croup (Option A) and acute epiglottitis (Option D), which cause acute upper respiratory tractobstruction, are ruled out due to the chronic nature of the symptoms. In croup, the upper airwayobstruction becomes apparent after 1 to 3 days of low-grade fever, rhinorrhea, and pharyngitis. Onthe other hand, in epiglottitis, a child experiences respiratory distress within hours of developinga fever.Vocal nodules (Option C) are not typically associated with respiratory distress.Respiratory papillomatosis is the most common respiratory tract neoplasm in children. They aresimple warts (benign tumors) caused by human papillomavirus types 6 and 11 commonly seen inchildren aged 3 to 5 years.The course involves remissions and exacerbations of recurrent papillomas, mostly affecting theglottic area (vocal cords), and supraglottis. The patient presents with progressively worseninghoarseness, sleep-disordered breathing, dyspnea, stridor, and severe airway obstruction if leftuntreated.Diagnosis confirmed by direct laryngoscopy, which shows grape-like projections (shown below),and biopsy. Treatment consists of micro laryngoscopy and CO2 laser excision. Antivirals likeinterferon alpha2a, ribavirin, cidofovir, and acyclovir are used as adjunct therapies.540Other options:Option A: Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) is caused by the parainfluenza virus. The patientinitially presents with an upper respiratory tract infection (rhinorrhea, pharyngitis, cough,low-grade fever) followed by a characteristic barking cough, hoarseness, and inspiratory stridor.Option C: Vocal nodule (singer's or screamer's nodule) occurs as a result of chronic vocal abuse.They appear symmetrically at the junction of the anterior one-third and posterior two third of thevocal cord. The patient presents with chronic hoarseness and voice fatigue.The image below shows symmetric vocal nodules:Option D: Acute epiglottitis is caused by streptococcus pyogenes, pneumococci, Hemophilusinfluenzae, and staphylococcus aureus. It is characterized by an acute rapidly progressive courseof high-grade fever, dyspnea, and stridor.541",
