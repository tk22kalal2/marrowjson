      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The tympanic branch of the facial nerve does not contribute to the tympanic plexus. The tympanic plexus is formed by three nerves: the glossopharyngeal nerve forms the tympanic branch, and the sympathetic fibers from the internal carotid plexus form the superior and inferior caroticotympanic nerves. The tympanic plexus innervates the tympanic membrane's medial surface, the tympanic cavity, mastoid air cells, and the bony Eustachian tube. It also carries secretory fibers for the parotid gland, and in Frey's syndrome, the tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve can be sectioned.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The facial nerve runs horizontally in the medial wall and vertically in the posterior wall of the middle ear. The medial wall is related to the 3rd part, which runs from the 1st genu (processus cochleariformis) to the 2nd genu (pyramid). It is called the tympanic or horizontal part. The posterior wall is related to the 4th part, which runs from the genu (pyramid) to the stylomastoid foramen where it exits the temporal bone. It is called the mastoid or the vertical part.
