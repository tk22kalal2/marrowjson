      "explanation": "Intolerance to loud sounds in this patient is due to the recruitment phenomenon (sound is amplified to be heard better). It is a feature of all cochlear pathologies. The characteristic presentation of a middle-aged man with vertigo, tinnitus, and intolerance to loud sounds points to a diagnosis of Ménière's disease. It is a cochlear pathology, hence shows the recruitment phenomenon. The rollover phenomenon is a feature of retro-cochlear pathologies like an acoustic neuroma. Diplacusis is the perception of a single auditory stimulus as sounds of a different pitch in two ears. Tullio phenomenon is a condition where loud sounds precipitate a vertiginous attack.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical history points to a diagnosis of Ménière's disease. The glycerol test is useful for the diagnosis of Ménière's disease. Glycerol is an osmotic diuretic which, when given orally, reduces hydrops and improves symptoms. Electrocochleography done along with a glycerol test; an improvement after administration of glycerol is diagnostic of Ménière's disease. The caloric test used in Ménière's disease is not diagnostic, as it is abnormal in many other conditions, like ototoxicity, vestibular schwannoma, vestibular neuritis, etc. The Dix-Hallpike test is performed to diagnose BPPV; a positive test would result in a vertiginous episode and nystagmus observed by the clinician.",

      "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis would be Lermoyez syndrome. It is a variant of Ménière's wherein the symptoms appear in reverse order. The patient presents with a progressive hearing loss followed by an attack of vertigo, which causes improvement in hearing. Lemierre's syndrome is a condition characterized by infectious thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein and bacteremia caused by primarily anaerobic organisms, following a recent oropharyngeal infection. Leriche syndrome, commonly referred to as an aortoiliac occlusive disease, is due to thrombotic occlusion of the abdominal aorta just above the site of its bifurcation. Leigh syndrome (subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy) is a rare genetic neurometabolic disorder characterized by degeneration of the CNS.",

        "C": "Vestibular neurectomy",
        "D": "Intratympanic gentamicin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The definitive treatment of intractable vertigo due to Meniere's disease is labyrinthectomy. Labyrinthectomy involves uniform destruction of hearing and vestibular function. Ideal candidates have no functional hearing and have failed more conservative treatments, such as gentamicin injection. Despite this morbidity, labyrinthectomy has the highest rate of vertigo control (over 95%), more than vestibular neurectomy (78-90%), and is considered the single definitive treatment. The step-by-step management approach for Meniere's disease consists of dietary modifications and vestibular suppressants as the initial measures, followed by intratympanic gentamicin ablation, and finally, surgical intervention. Primarily, the management of Meniere's disease involves a sodium-restricted diet and diuretics like acetazolamide (Option A). They are more useful for short-term control. Gentamicin (Option D) is a selective vestibulotoxic aminoglycoside antibiotic that is preferentially taken up by type I hair cells. It is opted for only if dietary modifications and vestibular suppressants have failed to control the symptoms. If used judiciously, hearing is preserved. The options for surgical management include endolymphatic sac surgery, vestibular neurectomy, and labyrinthectomy. Endolymphatic sac surgery is currently declining in popularity due to a lack of evidence of vertigo control. Vestibular neurectomy (Option C) refers to selective ablation of the vestibular nerve. Even though it is considered a hearing-sparing surgery and carries comparable rates of vertigo control as labyrinthectomy, it is an intradural procedure and carries a greater risk of complications. Hearing loss will still progress as it would have in the natural course of illness.",

        "A": "Gaze-dependent nystagmus",
        "B": "Positive Fistula test",
        "C": "Sensorineural hearing loss",
        "D": "Positive Tullio phenomenon"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Sensorineural hearing loss is not seen in superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome (SSCDS). They may experience mild to moderate conductive hearing loss. Conductive hearing loss is due to the abnormal transmission and dissipation of acoustic energy through the defect (third window), leading to reduced conduction to the cochlea for lower frequencies. This can manifest as a low-frequency air-bone gap at multiple frequencies. There is no defect in the cochlea or the auditory pathway. Superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) is a condition in which bone between the apex of the superior semicircular canal and the middle cranial fossa is absent. This causes endolymph in the labyrinthine system to move with sound or pressure, causing an activation of the vestibular system. Patients may have vestibular symptoms like vertigo triggered by loud sounds (Tullio phenomenon) or pressure such as coughing and can also experience hyperacusis for bone-conducted sounds. They may perceive the sounds of their own eye movements or footsteps in the affected ear. The patients may exhibit nystagmus when exposed to loud sounds or during the Valsalva maneuver or pressure in the ear canal (positive fistula test). The direction of the nystagmus aligns with the affected superior semicircular canal, and some patients may tilt their heads in the plane of the affected superior semicircular canal in response to loud sounds. Noncontrast HRCT of the temporal bone can demonstrate the defect. The click-evoked VEMP (vestibular evoked myogenic potential) response and vestibuloocular reflex are pronounced in SSCD patients, in which the evoked eye movements align with the affected superior canal. For mild symptoms, avoidance of triggers is recommended. In case of severe disabling symptoms, surgical resurfacing of the superior semicircular canal or plugging of the superior semicircular canal may be attempted.",

        "C": "Labyrinthitis",
        "D": "Syncope"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario, with complaints of dizziness associated with postural change and no history of loss of consciousness, is suggestive of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is one of the common causes of recurrent vertigo, and the episodes are brief (<1 minute) and are always provoked by changes in head position. The attacks are caused by free-floating calcium carbonate crystals usually dislodged from the posterior canal. A positive Dix-Hallpike maneuver confirms the diagnosis of BPPV. In this maneuver, the patient begins sitting up with their head turned 45 degrees toward the ear to be tested. Then the patient is made to lie down quickly with their head past the end of the bed. Then, the patient's neck is extended 20 degrees below the horizontal. The clinician then watches the patient's eyes for torsional and up-beating nystagmus, which should persist for no more than one minute. This would indicate a positive test. Epley's maneuver is performed to reposition the crystals into the macula from the semicircular canals. This is only a temporary cure, and there is a high rate of recurrence. Epley's maneuver: Return patient to upright seated position with neck flexed for 20-30 seconds. With patient seated on the table, turn head 45° toward the affected side while extending the neck. Lay the patient down, keeping the head rotated, and extend the neck 10 to 20 degrees, depending on the patient's ability and comfort. Hold this position for 20-30 seconds or until nystagmus ceases. Turn head another 90°, rolling the body toward the unaffected side. Hold this position for 20-30 seconds or until nystagmus or vertigo ceases. Turn head 90° toward the unaffected side. Hold this position for 20-30 seconds or until nystagmus or vertigo ceases.",

The diagnostic maneuver used in BPPV is the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, the gold standard for diagnosing BPPV. The therapeutic maneuver is Epley's maneuver. BPPV is one of the common causes of recurrent vertigo, and the episodes are brief (<1 min) and are always provoked by changes in head position. The attacks are caused by free-floating calcium carbonate crystals usually dislodged from the posterior canal. A patient presenting with vertigo should be evaluated for ruling out central lesions (like a tumor in the fourth ventricle, multiple sclerosis, etc.) before confirming the diagnosis of BPPV. Dix-Hallpike maneuver helps rule out central lesions and also diagnose BPPV. Dix-Hallpike maneuver: • The maneuver starts with the patient in a sitting position. • Their head is turned 45 degrees towards the ear to be tested. • The examiner quickly brings the patient to a supine position with their head 30 degrees below the horizontal. • The 45-degree head rotation is maintained during the procedure. Now the examiner observes the patient for nystagmus.",
