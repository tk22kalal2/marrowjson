      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Incisura terminalis cannot be used to harvest cartilage as it is devoid of cartilage. It is the part of the pinna between the tragus and the crus of helix. Being devoid of cartilage, the incision for endaural approach for ear surgery can be made here. The lobule is also devoid of cartilage. Hence, it is the safest site for piercing. The parts of the pinna are: Helix, Antihelix, Concha, Antitragus, Triangular fossa, Incisura terminalis, External acoustic meatus, Tragus, and Lobule.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Ceruminous glands are modified apocrine sweat glands. They open into hair follicles and participate in wax production. Apocrine glands release their products by decapitation. It is a process by which membrane-bound cytoplasm from the apical surface of the cells buds off into the lumen of the duct and is secreted. Some apocrine glands have specific names. Those on the eyelids are referred to as Moll's glands, and those on the external auditory meatus are termed ceruminous glands.",

      "explanation": "Cough on scratching the external acoustic canal is due to the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (Arnold's nerve). Arnold's nerve supplies the concha and corresponding eminence on the medial surface. It also supplies the posterior wall and floor of the external auditory canal. Scratching or mechanical stimulation of the ear leads to activation of Arnold's nerve, which evokes reflex cough (ear-cough reflex/otorespiratory reflex). The image below shows the nerve supply of the pinna: Causes of referred otalgia - Temporomandibular joint and dental conditions, parotid infections/tumors, and anterior 2/3rd of tongue. Nerve responsible - Site: Auriculotemporal nerve - Tragal area, crus of the helix, and anterior wall and roof of the external auditory canal. Causes of referred otalgia - Acute tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, carcinoma base of the tongue or tonsils (oropharynx), carcinoma of the larynx (cough), hypopharynx, epiglottis, vallecula, esophagus, and thyroid; Cervical spondylitis; Acoustic neuroma. Nerve responsible - The glossopharyngeal nerve (Jacobson's) - Auricular branch of the vagus nerve (Arnold's/Alderman's nerve) - Great auricular nerve (C2,3) - Facial nerve (nervus intermedius/nerve of Wrisberg). Site - Medial surface of the tympanic membrane, and middle ear - Concha, posterior wall, and floor of the external auditory canal - Lateral and medial surfaces of the pinna - Concha, retroauricular groove, and posterosuperior part of the external auditory meatus. Numbness in the posterosuperior meatal wall, known as Hitzelberger's sign, is seen in acoustic neuroma.
