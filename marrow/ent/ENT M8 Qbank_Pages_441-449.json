      "explanation": "Descending pharyngeal artery does not pass through the sinus of Morgagni and hence is least likely to be affected. All the other options are contents of the sinus of Morgagni. The sinus of Morgagni is a space between the base of the skull and the upper free border of the superior constrictor muscle. The structures passing through the space are: Eustachian tube, Levator veli palatini, Tensor veli palatini, and Ascending palatine artery - a branch of the facial artery. Trotter's triad or sinus of Morgagni syndrome is seen in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which spreads laterally to involve the sinus of Morgagni. It is characterized by: conductive hearing loss, ipsilateral immobility of the palate, and neuralgic pain.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical picture is suggestive of a diagnosis of Plummer-Vinson syndrome. The post-cricoid region is a common site for carcinoma in women suffering from Plummer-Vinson syndrome. Plummer-Vinson syndrome/Patterson-Kelly-Brown syndrome is a condition that can occur in people with long-term (chronic) iron deficiency anemia. The triad seen in these patients: • Post-cricoid webs • Glossitis • Angular cheilitis. The post-cricoid region is the part of the anterior wall of the laryngopharynx between the upper and lower borders of the cricoid lamina.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Pyriform sinus is richly supplied by lymphatics and drains into the upper deep cervical group oflymph nodes.The lymphatics exit through the thyrohyoid membrane to drain into the upper jugular chain.Pyriform sinus lies on either side of the larynx and extends from the pharyngoepiglottic fold to theupper end of the esophagus. It forms the lateral channel for food. The rich lymphatic network ofpyriform fossa explains the high frequency of nodal metastasis seen in carcinoma of this region.449",
