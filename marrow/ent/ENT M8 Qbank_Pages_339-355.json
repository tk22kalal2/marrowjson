Streptomycin (1g/day) and tetracycline (2 g/day) are given for a minimum of 4-6 weeks and continued till 2consecutive biopsies are negative. Surgery is reserved to establish airway or correct deformity.Biopsy in the case of rhinoscleroma shows infiltration of submucosa with plasma cells,lymphocytes, eosinophils, Mikulicz cells, and Russell bodies.Mikulicz cells are large foam cells with a central nucleus and vacuolated cytoplasm containingcausative bacilli.Russell bodies are homogenous eosinophilic inclusion bodies found in the plasma cells. Theyoccur due to the accumulation of immunoglobulins secreted by the plasma cells.The following image shows rhinoscleroma with Mikulicz cells.H&amp;E showing a mixture of plasma cells (arrow), lymphocytes (short arrow), Miculikz cellswhich are vacuolated macrophages containing causative bacilli (double arrow).Option A: Rhinoscleroma is endemic in several parts of the world.
