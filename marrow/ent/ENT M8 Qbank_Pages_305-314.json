      "explanation": "Occipitomental view is called Water's view. Water's view with an open mouth is known as Pierre'sview. Among the given options, Water's view is the best answer.In Water's view, the patient's head is positioned such that the nose and the chin touch the filmwhile the X-rays are projected from backward. The mouth is usually kept open, which allowsvisualizing the sphenoid sinus.Structures seen in Water's view are:•Maxillary sinuses (seen best)• Frontal sinuses• Sphenoid sinus (if the film is taken with an open mouth)•Zygoma• Zygomatic arch• Nasal bone.• Frontal process of the maxilla•Superior orbital fissure• Infratemporal fossaOther options:Option B: Towne's view is an angled anteroposterior radiograph of the skull. Structures seen arethe petrous part of the pyramids, arcuate eminence, superior semicircular canal, mastoid antrum,internal auditory canal, tympanic cavity, cochlea, and external auditory canal. This view is taken313for acoustic neuroma and apical petrositis.Option C: Law's view is a lateral oblique X-ray view of the mastoid. Structures seen are theexternal auditory canal, mastoid air cells, tegmen, lateral sinus plate, and temporomandibularjoint.Option D: Stenver's view is an X-ray view of the skull where the long axis of the petrous bone isparallel to the film. Structures seen are the entire petrous pyramid, arcuate eminence, internalauditory meatus, labyrinth with its vestibule, cochlea, and mastoid antrum.314",
