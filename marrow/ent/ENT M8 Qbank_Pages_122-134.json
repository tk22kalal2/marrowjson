        "A": "It is a benign tumor",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The image shows the presence of a large mass of white keratin debris in the left upper quadrant of the left tympanic membrane. This, along with the clinical scenario, is suggestive of cholesteatoma, which is also known as epidermosis or keratoma. Cholesteatoma is the presence of stratified squamous epithelium in the middle ear, where it is not usually present, i.e., skin in the wrong place. A central white mass, consisting of keratin debris, is produced by the matrix. For this reason, it has also been named epidermosis or keratoma. The term cholesteatoma is a misnomer because it neither contains cholesterol crystals nor is it a tumor to merit the suffix 'oma.'",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario suggests a diagnosis of secondary acquired cholesteatoma. The history of middle ear infection and hearing loss after surgery of the tympanic membrane makes the diagnosis more likely. Classification of cholesteatoma: 1. Congenital cholesteatoma is that which has its nidus of trapped squamous epithelium present at birth. 2. Primary acquired cholesteatoma presents with no history of previous otitis media or a pre-existing perforation. It is associated with a defect in pars flaccida. 3. Secondary acquired cholesteatoma presents with a history of previous otitis media or a pre-existing perforation. It is associated with a defect in pars tensa.",

      "explanation": "von Békésy proposed the traveling wave theory, whereas Sade's metaplasia theory explains the origin of cholesteatoma. Cholesteatoma can be of 2 main types: • Congenital cholesteatoma - explained by the presence of congenital cell rests within the middle ear and other parts of the temporal bone. • Acquired cholesteatoma - explained by a pathology either within the mastoid air cell system and Eustachian tube drainage, or the tympanic membrane epithelium.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The most accepted theory for secondary cholesteatoma is Habermann's theory. It proposes that the skin of the external auditory meatus grows or migrates into the middle ear through the posterosuperior marginal perforation or attic perforation, forming cholesteatoma.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with the otoendoscopy showing a white pearly mass behind the intact eardrum in the anterosuperior quadrant is suggestive of congenital cholesteatoma. Levenson criteria should be satisfied in order to diagnose this condition. Levenson criteria: • A white mass behind the normal tympanic membrane • Normal pars tensa and pars flaccida • No prior history of otorrhoea • No prior history of otological procedure • Episodes of otitis media with effusion should not be considered as exclusion criteria. Another popular guideline used is Derlak and Clemis which includes all the above except for the 4th criteria.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Release of enzymes like collagenase and acid phosphatase at the site of destruction",

        "D": "Erosion of ossicles is more common in children compared to adults"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Cholesteatoma does not cause bone destruction by pressure necrosis. Bone destruction by cholesteatoma has been attributed to enzymes liberated by osteoclasts and mononuclear inflammatory cells, such as: • Collagenase • Acid phosphatase and • Proteolytic enzymes. Pediatric cholesteatoma (PC) has more inflammation and greater chances of ossicular erosion compared to adults. However, PC has lesser chances of petrous labyrinth invasion and lateral semicircular canal fistula formation.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Residual cholesteatoma is most likely to be seen in the sinus tympani. The involvement of sinus tympani, along with posterior mesotympanum, is a recognized risk factor for residual cholesteatoma. This is because it is particularly difficult to remove the disease from these areas. Canal wall-up procedures have a higher risk of leaving residual disease behind than the canal wall-down procedures. Sinus tympani or infra pyramidal recess is the medial of the two posterior spaces in the middle ear. It is bounded by: the pyramid and vertical segment of facial nerve laterally, the stapes and oval window medially, the ponticulus superiorly, and the subiculum inferiorly.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Tubotympanic type (TTD) of CSOM is considered the safe type in relative terms to atticoantral disease (AAD) as TTD has less chance of complications than AAD. Note: TTD can also lead to complications, but the incidence is much less than that in AAD.",

      "explanation": "The given otoscopic image shows a subtotal perforation. It involves all four quadrants of the tympanic membrane but is covered by remnant pars tensa/annulus all around.

      "options": {
        "A": "No evidence of bone destruction in CT scans",
        "B": "Mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections are seen",
        "C": "Aural polyp if present, should never be avulsed",
        "D": "Often associated with cholesteatoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario of intermittent mucoid discharge and central perforation of the tympanic membrane points to a diagnosis of tubotympanic type of CSOM, which is not associated with cholesteatoma. Atticoantral type is associated with cholesteatoma and it leads to dangerous complications due to its bone-eroding properties. Etiology of tubotympanic (benign or safe) type of CSOM: • As a sequela of acute otitis media • Ascending infection via the eustachian tube. Allergic conditions. Bone destruction is not present in this type. Culture reveals mixed aerobic and anaerobic infection. Aural polyp if present should be removed and not avulsed before starting local treatment. This is due to the fact that the polyp may be arising from the stapes, facial nerve, or horizontal canal and its avulsion can lead to facial paralysis or labyrinthitis.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of tympanosclerosis. It is a sequela of long-standing middle ear disease where there are hyaline deposits within the middle ear, which calcify leading to impaired mobility of the ossicles. The common sites are the tympanic membrane, promontory, ossicles, joints, tendons, and oval and round windows. When hyalinization and calcification involve only the tympanic membrane, it is known as myringosclerosis.",

        "A": "Bone conduction",
        "B": "Cholesteatoma hearer",
        "C": "Round window shielding effect",
        "D": "Patient is malingering"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given scenario describes the round window-shielding effect that is seen in the tubotympanic type of CSOM. The round window-shielding effect is where the ear discharge shields the round window from sound waves. During the inactive phase (no discharge), the sound strikes both the oval window and round window together and the noise cancels itself out. So, the hearing is worse when the ear is dry. Cholesteatoma hearer is a patient with a discontinuous ossicular chain but the sound is conducted through the cholesteatoma to the footplate. On removing the cholesteatoma by surgery, the patient has worse hearing.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Nine-step test",
        "B": "Side-step test",
        "C": "Patch test",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The patch test is useful in assessing the status of the ossicles preoperatively so that the surgeon can be prepared for ossicular reconstruction if required. It is done in the tubotympanic type of CSOM. A thin, paper-like cigarette foil is soaked in vaseline and cut into the size of the perforation and is used to close the perforation. Pure tone audiometry is done before and after the closure of the perforation. Results are as follows: Improved hearing – intact ossicular chain; Decreased hearing – ossicular fixity or discontinuity; No improvement – technical fault or improper hearing. Another test done in the tubotympanic type of CSOM is Bonsin's test. When the eardrum is painted with a 1 in 20% solution of silver nitrate, the perforation stands out as a black spot against a white background. Option A: The Nine-step test is used to predict the ears at risk of middle ear barotrauma. Options B and D: The side-step test and Unterberger test are vestibular tests and are positive in perilymphatic fistula.",
