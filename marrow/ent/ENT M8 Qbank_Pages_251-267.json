      "explanation": "The negative Rinne test for 512 Hz indicates a minimum air-bone gap of 30 dB.261Rinne's test is a tuning fork test performed commonly with tuning forks of frequencies such as128, 256, 512, and 1024 Hz.Rinne's test is done by placing a vibrating tuning fork on the patient's mastoid and when he stopshearing, it is brought beside the external auditory meatus (EAC). If he still hears the sound, airconduction (AC) is better than bone conduction (BC) i.e. AC&gt;BC. The inferences are as follows:• Rinne's test is considered positive (normal) when the air conduction AC&gt;BC is seen in normalpeople and people with sensorineural deafness.• It is considered negative when the BC&gt;AC, and is seen in patients with conductive deafness.As a general prediction, a negative Rinne's test with any tuning fork frequency suggests aminimum hearing loss of at least 15 - 20 dB.The table below indicates a rough minimum air-bonegap for negative Rinne's test at different frequencies:A prediction of the air-bone gap can be made based on the combination of tuning fork tests of256, 512, and 1024 Hz:•• A Rinne test negative for 256 Hz but positive for 512 Hz indicates an air-bone gap of 20-30 dB.• A Rinne test negative for 256 and 512 Hz but positive for 1024 Hz indicates an air-bone gapof 30-45 dB.• A Rinne test negative for 256, 512, and 1024 Hz indicates an air-bone gap of 45-60 dB.Negative Rinne teMinimum air-bonestgap256 Hz15 dB512 Hz30 dB1024 Hz45 dB",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario indicates severe sensorineural hearing loss as a consequence of untreated suppurative labyrinthitis and Rinne's test is a false negative in this case. Initially, the patient had a positive fistula test, which implies that the labyrinth is still functioning. Rinne's test is positive which could be due to normal hearing or sensorineural hearing loss. Currently, the patient has a negative fistula test which implies that the labyrinth is dead. This is an example of severe sensorineural hearing loss and here, Rinne test is a false negative. If intermittent pressure applied to the external ear produces vertigo and nystagmus, it is a positive fistula test. The pressure changes in the external ear are transmitted to the labyrinth. This is suggestive of abnormal communication between the middle ear and the inner ear.",

      "explanation": "The image shows the Weber test being performed. Ménière's disease causes sensorineural hearing loss and hence the Weber test is lateralized towards the better ear. In Weber's test, a vibrating tuning fork is placed in the middle of the forehead or the vertex and the patient is asked in which ear the sound is heard. It is lateralized to the worse ear in conductive deafness and to the better ear in sensorineural deafness. Option A: Superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome causes conductive hearing loss. Thus, Weber is lateralized to the worse ear. Option B: In normal individuals, the sound is heard equally in both ears. So Weber is not lateralized. Option C: Cochlear otosclerosis causes sensorineural deafness, whereas stapedial otosclerosis causes conductive hearing loss. Thus, Weber is lateralized to the better ear in case of cochlear otosclerosis.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) damages the outer hair cells, starting in the basal turn of thecochlea. Outer hair cells are affected before the inner hair cells.NIHL occurs after chronic exposure to less intense sounds. The damage caused by noise traumadepends on the frequency of noise (frequency of 2000 to 3000 Hz causes more damage) intensity,duration of the noise, and preexisting ear disease.The audiogram in noise-induced hearing loss shows a typical notch at 4000Hz both for air andbone conduction known as acoustic dip/boiler's notch. Patients at this stage complain ofhigh-pitched tinnitus and difficulty hearing in noisy surroundings. Pre-employment and annualaudiograms for persons working at places where noise is above 85 dB (A) help in the early265detection of NIHL.The human ear can hear frequencies from about 20 to 20,000 Hz. Below 20 Hz, the vibrations areinfra-audible, and above 20,000 Hz, they are ultra-sonic. Pure tone audiometry can detect only upto 8000 Hz.Extended high-frequency audiometry is recommended for early detection of hearing loss, as it canidentify hearing impairments before the frequencies necessary for speech comprehension areaffected. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions is a more sensitive tool than conventionalaudiometry, particularly in children under 5 years old for early detection of hearing loss.A noise of 90 dB(A) SPL (acceptable noise levels, sound pressure level), 8 hours a day for 5 daysper week is the maximum safe limit as recommended by the Ministry of Labour. As per WHO, 85dB(A) is considered the highest safe exposure level up to a maximum of 8 hours.The silence zone extends to a distance of 100 meters around the premises of hospitals, nursinghomes, educational institutions, and courts.Permissible limits of noise as per the noise pollution (Regulation and Control) rules:Noise levels are measured in dB(A), which prioritizes middle-range frequencies for assessingnoise-induced hearing loss while giving less weightage to low and high frequencies.The image below shows an acoustic dip at 4000Hz:Zone/AreaDay(6 am to 10 pm) limits indB(A)Industria 751Commerc65ialResidenti55alSilence50Hearing level (dB ISO)Night(10 pm to 6 am) limits in dB(A)7055554540Pure tone audiogram showingnoise-induced sensorineural hearing loss-20-10RightO10203040506070Characteristicacoustic dip at 4000Hz80901001101201252505001000DQ200040008000Frequency (Hz)OMARROW266Other options:Option A: Crista ampullaris is a thickened ridge of neuroepithelium in the ampullated end ofsemicircular ducts.Option B: Macula is the sensory epithelium of the utricleOption C: Cupula is a gelatinous mass extending from the surface of the crista (peripheral receptorlocated in the ampullated end of semicircular ducts) to the ceiling of the ampulla, into whichproject the cilia of sensory hair cells.267",
