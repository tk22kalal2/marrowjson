Structures seen are the maxillarysinus (best seen), sphenoid sinus (if the film is taken with an open mouth), frontal sinus, zygoma,zygomatic arch, nasal bone, and infratemporal fossa.Option C: Pierre's view is the occipitomental with an open mouth. It helps in visualizing thesphenoid sinus as well, in addition to the sinuses that can be seen in water's view.Option D: Towne's view is an angled anteroposterior radiograph of the skull. Structures seen arethe petrous part of the pyramids, arcuate eminence, superior semicircular canal, mastoid antrum,internal auditory canal, tympanic cavity, cochlea, and external auditory canal.
