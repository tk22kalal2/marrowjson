      "explanation": "The image shows a dark-colored summit over a swelling, usually seen in a sebaceous cyst. Sebaceous cysts are the retention cysts of the sebaceous gland that are usually present on the face, scalp, or scrotum. They contain yellowish-white cheesy material with fat and epithelium. Clinical features: • The swelling is painless, soft, and freely mobile. • Though non-transilluminating, they are Paget's test positive (fluctuant). • Punctum is seen in 70% of the patients with sebaceous cysts. They are dark in color due to the accumulation of denuded epithelium. • They also have an unpleasant sebum odor. • The swelling can ulcerate and become painful (Cock's peculiar tumor). Some cysts over the scalp may also harden over time (Sebaceous horn). • Many may get infected and lead to abscess formation. Treatment: • Excision including skin adjacent to punctum using elliptical incision-dissection method. • Incision and avulsion of cyst wall. • In the presence of an abscess, an initial treatment with an incision later followed by excision of the cyst. Other options: Option A: Dermoid cysts present as firm painless subcutaneous nodules and are of 4 types: • Sequestration dermoid - sequestration of epithelium during embryological development • Tubulodermoid - accumulation of secretions from ectodermal tube/duct • Implantation dermoid - implantation of the epidermis due to trauma • Teratomatous dermoid - having all 3 germ layers (ecto, meso, and endoderm). Option C: Meningiomas are benign tumors arising from the meningothelial cells of the dura. They present with headaches, seizures, or focal neurological deficits. Option D: Postauricular cutaneous mastoid fistula is a rare complication of chronic otitis media that heals very slowly and needs surgical closure.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Rollover phenomenon is diagnostic of acoustic neuroma. It is a feature of retro-cochlear/neural lesions wherein the speech discrimination steadily increases with intensity but suddenly drops significantly beyond a particular intensity of sound. Meniere's disease is an important differential for acoustic neuroma as the patients suffer from similar symptoms. Meniere's is a cochlear pathology and acoustic neuroma is retrocochlear. Option A - Stapedial reflex is present in cochlear lesions (Meniere's) and absent in retrocochlear lesion (acoustic neuroma). Option B - Recruitment phenomenon is the abnormal growth in loudness in the affected ear, seen in cochlear pathologies. Option C - SISI (short increment sensitivity index) is a test of intensity discrimination which is very high in cochlear pathologies but low in retro-cochlear.",

It is used for the conization ofthe cervix in cervical carcinoma.Stereotactic radiosurgery is a reasonable alternative for people who refuse or cannot toleratesurgery. Here, beams are modified and focused only to concentrate on the tumor and have little.effect on surrounding tissue. It can be done by using• X-knife using a linear accelerator (LINAC)• Gamma-knife using Cobalt 60•CyberKnife-image-guided linear accelerator using real-time image guidance to deliver radiationfrom multiple angles.External beam radiation is not recommended as it causes significant damage to the surroundingbrain and neural structures.204",
