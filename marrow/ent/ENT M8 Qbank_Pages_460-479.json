The glossopharyngealnerve and the styloid process lie in relation to the lower part of the tonsillar fossa. Therefore, anyirritation or pain can be referred to the ear along the tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal(Jacobson's) nerve.Causes of referred otalgia via the glossopharyngeal nerve include acute pharyngitis, tonsillitis,peritonsillar abscess, post-tonsillectomy, foreign bodies embedded in the base of the tongue ortonsillar area and an elongated styloid process (Eagle's syndrome).The ear receives extensive sensory innervation via four cranial nerves (V, VII, IX, and X) and twospinal segments (C2 and C3).The image below shows the anatomic relations of the tonsil and tonsillar bed:Relations of tonsil-Tonsillar bed10Palatine tonsilLoose areolar tissue with paratonsillar veinPharyngobasilar fasciaSuperior constrictor muscleStyloglossusBuccopharyngeal fasciaFacial arteryGlossopharyngeal nerveSubmandibular glandMedial pterygoidAngle of mandible©MARROW",
