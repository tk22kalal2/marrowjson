      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario points to a diagnosis of refractory posterior epistaxis. The artery that is most commonly ligated in a case of refractory posterior epistaxis is the sphenopalatine artery. Posterior epistaxis is most commonly seen in older age groups. The bleeding is spontaneous, often due to hypertension, and is severe, requiring hospitalization. Refractory epistaxis is defined as recurrent or persistent bleeding after appropriate packing or multiple episodes of epistaxis during a short period, each requiring medical attention. Sphenopalatine artery ligation gives high success in the control of refractory posterior bleeding. Therefore, transnasal endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation (TESPAL) is the preferred method. It is ligated at the sphenopalatine foramen situated 1 cm behind the posterior end of the middle turbinate. Anterior epistaxis: Children and young adults. Most common type. Age: Incidence: Cause: Trauma. Site: Little's area, anteroinferior part of the nasal septum. Bleeding: Mild, can be controlled by local pressure or nasal packing. Posterior epistaxis: >40 years. Less common. Spontaneous; often due to hypertension or arteriosclerosis. Site: Posterosuperior part of the nasal cavity; difficult to localize. Bleeding: Severe, often requires hospitalization and posterior nasal packing. Blood supply of the nasal septum: Internal carotid artery, anterior ethmoidal artery, Kiesselbach's plexus, septal branch, superior labial artery, ophthalmic artery, posterior ethmoidal artery, sphenoid sinus, sphenopalatine artery, greater palatine artery, maxillary artery, facial artery, external carotid artery.",

      "explanation": "Ethmoidal artery can cause epistaxis not controlled by external carotid artery ligation.335The ethmoidal artery is a branch of internal carotid artery, whereas sphenopalatine, greaterpalatine and facial artery are branches of the external carotid artery. Hence if the bleeding is notcontrolled by external carotid artery ligation, the subsequent step would be to ligate the ethmoidalartery.Epistaxis may be classified as anterior or posterior epistaxis.Little's area is situated in the anterior inferior part of the nasal septum, just above the vestibule. Itis the site of epistaxis in 90% of the cases.Four arteries anastomose here to form a vascular plexus called the Kiesselbach's plexus. This areais exposed to the drying effect of inspiratory current and to fingernail trauma and is the usual sitefor epistaxis in children and young adults.The four contributing arteries are as follows:•⚫ Septal branch of sphenopalatine and greater palatine branches of the maxillary artery, which inturn is a branch of the external carotid artery.•Septal branch of the superior labial artery which in turn is a branch of the facial artery.
