      "explanation": "Spasmodic dysphonia is not only a local laryngeal disorder. It is associated with manyneurological conditions too.There are 2 types of spasmodic dysphonia:Adductor dysphonia•The adductor muscles of the larynx go into spasm causing vocal cords to go into adduction. Thevoice becomes strained/strangled.•Treatment consists of botulinum toxin injections in the thyroarytenoid muscles on one or bothsides to relieve the spasm.Abductor dysphonia• It is due to the spasm of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle and thus the glottis is kept open.• The patient gets a breathy voice or breathy breaks in voice.Treatment consists of botulinum toxin injections in posterior cricoarytenoid muscles. Patientswho do not respond to toxin injection can be treated by type 1 thyroplasty or fat injection.",

Here, both thyroarytenoid and interarytenoid muscles are involved. Phonasthenia is the weakness of voice due to fatigue of laryngeal muscles. This leads to an aphonatory gap. The shape of the gap depends on the muscle involved: Thyroarytenoid alone: elliptical space. Interarytenoid alone: triangular space. Both thyroarytenoid and interarytenoid: keyhole appearance. Appearances of glottis in phonasthenia: Normal, Elliptical space - Weakness of thyroarytenoid, Triangular space - Weakness of Interarytenoid, Vestibular fold, Keyhole appearance - Weakness of both thyroarytenoid and interarytenoid.",

      "explanation": "Common cold leads to rhinolalia clausa. A large nasopharynx doesn't cause rhinolalia clausa but instead rhinolalia aperta. Rhinolalia clausa or hyponasality is a lack of nasal resonance for words that are resonated in the nasal cavity. Words with M, N, NG sounds like B, D, G. It is due to the blockage of the nose or nasopharynx. Common causes of rhinolalia clausa are: • Common cold • Nasal allergy • Nasal polypi • Nasal growth • Adenoids • Nasopharyngeal mass • Familial speech pattern.",

      "explanation": "Rhinolalia aperta or hypernasality of speech will be seen in this condition of cleft palate. It is seen when certain words, which have little nasal resonance, are resonated through the nose. The defect is the failure of the nasopharynx to cut off from the oropharynx or abnormal communication between the oral and nasal cavities. Common causes are: • Velopharyngeal insufficiency • Congenitally short soft palate • Submucous palate • Large nasopharynx • Cleft of soft palate • Paralysis of soft palate post adenoidectomy • Oronasal fistula • Familial speech pattern • Habitual speech pattern. NOTE: • Clausa = Close; closed nose and nasopharynx • Aperta = Open/aperture; abnormally open nose and nasopharynx",
