      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The image shows a cauliflower ear deformity, which is likely due to auricular hematoma. Auricular hematoma is a collection of blood between the auricular cartilage and its perichondrium. If left untreated, the extravasated blood may clot and then organize, resulting in a typical deformity called cauliflower ear. It is also called pugilistic or boxer's ear. It is often seen in boxers, wrestlers, and rugby players due to blunt trauma. Treatment comprises aspiration of the hematoma under strict aseptic precautions and a pressure dressing, to prevent reaccumulation. Aspiration may need to be repeated. If aspiration fails, incision and drainage should be done. All cases should receive prophylactic antibiotics.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of painful, erythematous ear swelling is suggestive of perichondritis. The most common cause is trauma, either iatrogenic (surgical incision) or non-iatrogenic (laceration, hematoma). It can be due to the extension of infection from diffuse otitis externa or a furuncle of the meatus. The most common organism responsible is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The image given below shows a patient with a cauliflower ear deformity. It is also known as perichondrial hematoma or wrestler's ear. It is usually caused by repeated episodes of trauma. Chondrodermatitis chronica helicis is a small, nodular, tender, chronic inflammatory lesion occurring on the helix of the ear.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Patients with repeated attacks of furunculosis should be investigated for diabetes mellitus. A furuncle is a staphylococcal infection of the hair follicle. As the hairs are confined only to the cartilaginous part of the meatus, a furuncle is seen only in the outer one-third of the EAC. Symptoms are severe compared to signs as the skin over the EAC is tightly adherent. The tragal sign is positive, and there is an obliteration of the retroauricular groove. It is treated by incision and drainage or 10% ichthammol glycerine wicks and antibiotics.",

        "C": "Antibiotics",
        "D": "Analgesics"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario is suggestive of diffuse otitis externa following a trauma. Aural toilet remains the most effective single treatment for this condition. All exudate and debris should be carefully removed, with special emphasis on the anteroinferior meatal recess, which forms a blind pocket and acts as a reservoir of infective secretion. The aural toilet can be done by dry mopping, suction clearance, or irrigating the canal with warm, sterile normal saline. Further treatment modalities: • After the aural toilet is done, wicks medicated with antibiotic-steroid preparation can be used. These wicks have to be changed daily for 2 to 3 days, which thereafter can be substituted by ear drops. • Broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics are used when there is cellulitis and acute tender lymphadenitis. • Analgesics are usually a part of management, as otitis externa is associated with severe pain. • Gauze wick soaked in 10% ichthammol glycerine is used to reduce swelling. • Astringents such as aluminum acetate (8%) or silver nitrate (3%) are used to dry up an oozing meatus.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario, along with the otoscopic image showing black-headed filamentous growth, is suggestive of otomycosis by Aspergillus niger. Irritation and itching are the most predominant symptoms of Aspergillus niger infection. Pain is predominant in Aspergillus flavus infection. The fungal mass in otomycosis is likened to a wet blotting paper/wet newspaper appearance. The appearances of otomycosis on otoscopy and the causative organisms are: • Black-headed filamentous growth - Aspergillus niger infection; • Green or brown - Aspergillus fumigatus infection; • White and creamy deposit - Candida infection. Rhizopus oryzae is one of the causative agents of mucormycosis. The common clinical form of this opportunistic infection is rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM).

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of facial paralysis along with vesicular eruptions in the external auditory canal and tympanic membrane is suggestive of Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus). Ramsay Hunt Syndrome is caused by the reactivation of Herpes zoster in the geniculate ganglion. In most patients, there is an involvement of the trunk of the facial nerve, which results in severe facial palsy. Often, the 8th cranial nerve is also involved, which causes hearing loss and vertigo. There may also be anesthesia of the face due to the involvement of the 5th cranial nerve. Bell's palsy is an idiopathic, peripheral facial paralysis or paresis of acute onset due to a lower motor neuron lesion of the facial nerve. Möebius syndrome is a congenital unilateral/bilateral lower motor neuron facial nerve paralysis with abducens palsy causing limited ocular abduction. Melkersson syndrome is an idiopathic disorder consisting of a triad of: facial paralysis, swelling of lips, and fissured tongue.",

        "D": "Narrowing of meatus causing facial nerve palsy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Keratosis obturans, by pressure effect, causes absorption of bone which causes widening (not narrowing) of the meatus leading to facial nerve palsy. Normally, epithelium from the surface of the tympanic membrane migrates onto the posterior meatal wall. Failure of this migration, or obstruction to migration caused by wax, may lead to keratosis obturans which is the accumulation of a large plug of desquamated keratin in the external auditory meatus. Features of keratosis obturans: • Severe otalgia • Conductive hearing loss • Thickened tympanic membrane • Keratin plug/pearly white mass occluding the canal • Widened ear canal - may lead to facial nerve paralysis • Hyperemia of canal skin, sometimes with ulcerations and granulomas. Staphylococcus aureus is the most frequent isolate. Keratosis obturans may be associated with systemic conditions like bronchiectasis and chronic sinusitis.",

        "C": "Myringoplasty",
        "D": "Otoplasty"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The surgery done to widen the cartilaginous part of the external auditory canal is meatoplasty. Meatoplasty is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of a crescent-shaped portion of conchal cartilage to widen the external auditory meatus. It is performed in combination with all-canal wall-down procedures like modified radical and radical mastoidectomies, for easy access to the mastoid cavity for periodic inspection and cleaning. It is also done as an isolated procedure in elderly people with sagging auricles. A sagging auricle causes obstruction to the meatus, leading to the retention of wax and difficulty in hearing. Other options: Option B: Tympanoplasty is the surgical reconstruction to correct damage in the middle ear and restore the integrity of the tympanic membrane for improved hearing. It is ossicular reconstruction only or ossicular reconstruction with myringoplasty. Option C: Myringoplasty refers to the reconstruction of the tympanic membrane only. Option D: Otoplasty is the correction of external ear/deformities of the pinna.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Meatoplasty is not a part of canal wall-up (CWU) procedures as the meatus appears normal. However, meatoplasty is performed in combination with all canal wall down procedures, like modified radical and radical mastoidectomies, for the treatment of middle ear disease such as cholesteatoma. The widened meatus helps to easily visualize and access the mastoid cavity for periodic inspection and cleaning. It is also done in atresia/stenosis to recanalize the ear and in tortuous canals post-tympanoplasty to improve hearing.",
