        "D": "Third pharyngeal pouch anomaly"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given image showing the presence of a sinus seen between the tragus and crus of the helix is suggestive of the preauricular sinus. It is due to improper fusion of the auricular tubercles formed from the first and second arches. The preauricular sinus is apparent at birth and is usually bilateral. There may be occasional sebaceous discharge from the punctum. It does not regress spontaneously.",

        "C": "5 or 6 years of age",
        "D": "3 or 4 years of age"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Reconstructive surgeries for congenital malformations of the pinna (auricle) are usually performed around 5 or 6 years of age. Autologous cartilages from ribs are harvested for these purposes and the ideal timing is between 6-10 years. At around 3 years of age, 85% of the auricular growth is complete and the cartilaginous growth is almost complete by 5 years. Surgery performed on the auricle after 5 years doesn't hinder further growth.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Invagination of the first pharyngeal groove, which is also known as the first branchial cleft, gives rise to the external auditory meatus. Previously, it was believed that the external auditory meatus develops from the first pharyngeal cleft. But recent studies suggest that the first pharyngeal groove, or the first branchial cleft, gives rise to the external auditory meatus.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Given clinical scenario is suggestive of a congenital auroral fistula, and the first branchial cleft is abnormal here. The fistula has two openings: • One situated in the neck just below and behind the angle of the mandible and • The other one in the external canal or the middle ear. The track of the fistula traverses through the parotid in close relation to the facial nerve.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The Eustachian tube develops from the first pharyngeal pouch. Initially, the first pharyngeal pouch forms the tubotympanic recess. The distal part of this recess widens to form the middle ear cavity. The proximal part forms the Eustachian tube.",

        "C": "Tympanic membrane",
        "D": "Tympanic cavity"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The mastoid does not reach adult size at birth. It develops fully by 2 years of age. In infants and children up to 2 years of age, the mastoid process is not developed completely. So, the facial nerve lies just beneath the skin near its exit. Hence, during surgical procedures, the incision is given slanting posteriorly, avoiding the lower part of the mastoid. This spares the facial nerve.",

        "B": "Petrosquamous suture",
        "C": "Temporosquamous suture",
        "D": "Petromastoid suture"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The persistence of the petrosquamous suture is called Korner's septum and it is responsible for the difficulty in locating the mastoid antrum and the deeper cells. Korner's septum separates superficial squamosal cells from the deep petrosal cells. Incomplete removal of disease at mastoidectomy can occur if Korner's septum is not identified. Mastoid antrum cannot be reached unless the Korner's septum has been removed.",

        "C": "Pars superior",
        "D": "Pars inferior"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The saccule develops from pars inferior. The development of the inner ear begins in the 3rd week of fetal life and is completed by the 16th week. The surface ectoderm on each side of the rhombencephalon thickens to form otic/auditory placodes, which then invaginate to form the otic vesicle (otocysts). The cells of the otic vesicle differentiate to form ganglion cells, which later develop into the vestibulocochlear ganglia. Later, each otic vesicle divides into a dorsal component called pars superior and a ventral component called pars inferior. Pars superior gives rise to the utricle, semicircular canals, and endolymphatic ducts. Pars inferior gives rise to the saccule and cochlear duct. The saccule is connected to the cochlea through a narrow duct called ductus reuniens.",
