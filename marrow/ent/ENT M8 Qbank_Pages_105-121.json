      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Choanal atresia does not predispose to Eustachian tube obstruction. Eustachian tube obstruction is caused by: Extrinsic causes, such as adenoid hypertrophy, nasopharyngeal tumors, and nasal pack. Intrinsic causes include allergic rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, and upper respiratory tract infection. Defective functioning of the tube can be due to cleft palate, Down syndrome, and submucous cleft palate. Eustachian tube obstruction can lead to complications such as acute suppurative otitis media, otitis media with effusion, chronic suppurative otitis media, atelectasis, and ossicular necrosis.",

      "explanation": "The clinical picture and image show the stage of pre-suppuration of acute suppurative otitis media (ASOM). During this stage, due to prolonged tubal occlusion, pyogenic organisms invade the tympanic cavity. An inflammatory exudate appears in the middle ear and there is congestion of pars tensa. A leash of blood vessels appears along with the handle of malleus and at the periphery of the tympanic membrane, imparting it a cart-wheel appearance. Later, the whole of the tympanic membrane, including pars flaccida, becomes uniformly red. Symptoms of this stage include marked earache, a high degree of fever, hearing loss, and tinnitus (seen only in adults). Tuning fork tests show the conductive type of hearing loss.",

Note: As per Dhingra Diseases of Ear Nose and Throat 7th edition, the perforation most commonly occurs in the anteroinferior quadrant. However, as Scott-Brown's Otorhinolaryngology: Head and Neck Surgery; 7th Edition mentions the most common site as the posterior half of pars tensa, we have picked it as the best option in this question.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The above clinical scenario points to a diagnosis of acute suppurative otitis media (ASOM) complicated by right-sided LMN facial nerve palsy. Otoscopic finding of a bulging tympanic membrane is an indication to perform myringotomy, i.e., a surgical opening in the tympanic membrane. Treatment of facial nerve paralysis secondary to otitis media: conservative management is preferred, using antibiotics and corticosteroids. Myringotomy and a ventilation tube should be added when spontaneous perforation of the tympanic membrane has not occurred. Facial nerve decompression is not usually necessary. Tympanoplasty is the removal of disease from the middle ear and reconstruction of hearing with or without myringoplasty.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The scenario points towards a diagnosis of acute suppurative otitis media (ASOM). Antibiotics form the mainstay of treatment in acute suppurative otitis media, and if the tympanic membrane is bulging, myringotomy should be done. Myringotomy is the procedure involving incising the tympanic membrane to evacuate pus. It is indicated when: • The tympanic membrane is bulging and there is acute pain. • There is an incomplete resolution despite antibiotics and the drum remains full with persistent conductive deafness. • There is persistent effusion beyond 12 weeks.",

A curvilinear incision is used in acute suppurative otitis media in the posteroinferior quadrant (smiling incision). Myringotomy in otitis media: Circumferential incision used in ASOM. Posterior radial incision used in SOM. Anterior. ASOM: acute suppurative otitis media; SOM: Serous otitis media. Note: Although an anteroinferior incision is the first step, we resort to an anterosuperior incision in the case of thick secretions that are difficult to aspirate.

      "explanation": "The lighthouse effect is seen in acute mastoiditis, which is a complication of otitis media. This effect is described as a pulsatile mucopurulent or purulent discharge, coming through a central pin-hole perforation of pars tensa. This suggests a reservoir of infection in the mastoid and middle ear. Note: Otoscopic signs in intratympanic glomus tumors include: Red reflex through an intact tympanic membrane, Pulsation sign or Brown sign - when ear canal pressure is raised with Siegel's speculum, the tumor pulsates vigorously and then blanches.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Beta-hemolytic streptococcus is the most common organism causing acute necrotizing otitis media. Acute necrotizing otitis media is a variety of acute suppurative otitis media. This is often seen in children suffering from measles, scarlet fever, or influenza. It leads to the destruction of the entire tympanic membrane, middle ear mucosa, and air cells. There is profuse otorrhea. In such cases, healing is followed by fibrosis or ingrowth of squamous epithelium from the meatus leading to a secondary acquired cholesteatoma. Treatment is early antibiotic therapy for at least 7-10 days. Cortical mastoidectomy may be indicated if medical treatment fails to control or the condition gets complicated by acute mastoiditis.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The effusion is thick, viscid, and sterile in most cases of serous otitis media. Etiology of serous otitis media: Malfunctioning of the eustachian tube: Adenoid hyperplasia in children - causes bilateral serous otitis media. Benign and malignant tumors of the nasopharynx - should always be excluded in unilateral serous otitis media in an adult. Cleft lip, cleft palate, and chronic tonsillitis - interference with eustachian tube opening. Otitic barotrauma, allergy increases middle ear secretions. Unresolved acute suppurative otitis media - due to inadequate treatment dosage or duration. Viral infections - increased secretory activity due to stimulation of middle ear mucosa.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and image suggest a diagnosis of serous otitis media. The golden yellow discoloration of the tympanic membrane is caused by the clear, watery, straw-colored effusion filling the middle ear. Since the fluid is clear, one can see the structures of the middle ear quite clearly on otoscopy. Patients having serous otitis media will have hearing loss that rarely exceeds 40 dB. This deafness can pass unnoticed and may be accidentally discovered during audiometric screening tests. Because of hearing loss, the development of speech is delayed or defective. Otoscopic findings in serous otitis media: • Fluid level and air bubbles are seen when fluid is thin and the tympanic membrane is transparent. • In chronic cases, the fluid becomes very sticky; hence, the name 'glue ear'. • The tympanic membrane is often dull and opaque with a loss of light reflex. • The mobility of the tympanic membrane is restricted.",

Here, compliance decreases, i.e., mobility of the tympanic membrane is restricted due to the effusion, usually secondary to negative middle ear pressure (Eustachian tube obstruction). This results in a B-type tympanogram. Hearing tests suggestive of conductive hearing loss as seen in serous otitis media: • Rinne negative (BC > AC). • Weber lateralized towards the worse ear. • Audiogram - AC abnormal, BC normal, air-bone gap present. • Impedance audiometry - flat curve (reduced compliance, shift to the negative side).

Tuberculosis of the ear usually occurs secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis. It is occasionally blood-borne, spreading from a tubercular focus in the lungs, tonsils, cervical or mesenteric lymph nodes. Tuberculous otitis media is mostly seen in children and young adults. It presents as a painless condition with foul-smelling discharge from the ear, that does not respond to standard antibiotic treatment. A thickened tympanic membrane with multiple perforations in pars tensa of the tympanic membrane and pale granulations in the middle ear cleft is seen. Multiple perforations are characteristic. Facial nerve palsy is the most common complication. Mastoiditis, postauricular fistula, osteomyelitis are also seen. Histopathology shows submucosal tubercles with Langhans giant cells and caseation necrosis. Smears and culture of ear discharge may be positive for AFB. Chest X-ray features of tuberculosis along with other evidence of tuberculosis in the body help in confirmation of the diagnosis. DNA probe and PCR from the ear discharge can provide an early diagnosis. Treatment includes: Antitubercular therapy, Aural toilet, Treatment of secondary infection, and Mastoid surgery for complications.
