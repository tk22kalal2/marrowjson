      "explanation": "Nasal secretions contain muramidase (lysozyme), lactoferrin, and immunoglobulins IgA and IgE, and interferon, and thus have antibacterial properties. Their pH is around 7. A copious flow of nasal secretions that follows irritation by a noxious substance helps to wash them out.",

        "D": "Ciliary action"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The movement of the mucus blanket of the nose is by ciliary action. The mucus blanket consists of a superficial mucus layer and a deeper serous layer, floating on the top of cilia, which are constantly beating to carry it like a conveyor belt towards the nasopharynx. The mucus blanket moves at a speed of 5-10 mm/min and the complete sheet of mucus is cleared into the pharynx every 10-20 min. In mammals, cilia beat 10-20 times per second at room temperature.",

      "question": "A patient presents to you with bronchiectasis and chronic sinusitis. Chest X-Ray shows the following finding. Which of the following is the method of protection of the lower airway that's compromised in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Temperature regulation",

        "C": "Mucociliary mechanism",
        "D": "Mucosal defense with immunoglobulins"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and the X-ray showing dextrocardia (situs inversus) is suggestive of Kartagener syndrome. The mucociliary mechanism is compromised in this case, due to immotile cilia. The lower airway is protected by the following mechanisms: \n   • Mucociliary mechanism - The inspired pathogens and dust are trapped on the viscous mucous blanket. By beating of the cilia, the mucus is carried to the nasopharynx to be swallowed.\n   • Chemical mechanisms - Immunoglobulins such as IgA, IgE, and lactoferrin, lysozyme provide innate immunity.\n   • Sneezing. It is a protective reflex due to irritation of the nasal mucosa.\n   Temperature regulation and humidification are due to the large surface area of mucosa and highly vascular cavernous spaces. This is achieved by an increase or decrease in blood flow, which in turn increases or decreases the size of turbinates.",

Anosmia only occurs incase it leads to nasal polyposisCauses of anosmia:• Nasal obstruction due to nasal polyps, enlarged turbinates, or mucosal edema due to infections.• Atrophic rhinitis, a degenerative disorder of nasal mucosa.••Peripheral neuritis (toxic or influenzal)•Injury to olfactory nerves or olfactory bulb in fractures of anterior cranial fossa• Intracranial lesions like abscesses, tumors, or meningitis, which cause pressure on olfactorytracts.• COVID-19 is associated with a complete lack of taste and smell and is a common presentingsymptom",

      "explanation": "Parosmia is the perversion of smell. It is seen classically in the recovery phase of postinfluenzalanosmia, and has been recently reported as a rare complication in post-COVID patients.The probable explanation is misdirected regeneration of nerve fibers. Intracranial tumors shouldbe ruled out in all cases of parosmia.Option A: Anosmia is the complete lack of smellOption B: Phantosmia is the sensation of olfaction in the absence of a stimulusOption D: Olfactory agnosia is the inability to recognize an odour sensation321",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Paranasal sinuses are ventilated during expiration. Ventilation of sinuses is paradoxical, as theyare emptied of air during inspiration and filled with air during expiration.During inspiration, negative pressure is created in the nose by the air current, whereas duringexpiration, positive pressure is created in the nose, and this sets up eddy currents, which ventilatethe sinuses.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Airway resistance is not a function of paranasal sinuses. Resistance to the flow of air in the nose maintains the positive pressure needed to keep the alveoli open. It is due to two factors: bones, cartilages, and attached muscles - fixed; mucosa - variable.",
