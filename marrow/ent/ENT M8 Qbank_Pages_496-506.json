      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The image shows a nasopharyngeal mass suggestive of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma(JNA), which is causing difficulty in breathing and swallowing. It is more common in males.The tumor is predominantly seen in adolescent males in the second decade of life. It is thought tobe testosterone dependent. Patients have a hamartomatous nidus of vascular tissue in thenasopharynx which is activated to form angiofibroma when male sex hormones appear.A biopsy is contraindicated due to the risk of severe bleeding. The vessels lack contractilecomponents and hence bleeding cannot be controlled with adrenaline.",

Profuse, recurrent, and spontaneous epistaxis is the most common presentation.The patients may be markedly anemic due to repeated blood loss.Conductive hearing loss and otitis media with effusion occur due to obstruction of the eustachiantube.It can spread to the orbit giving rise to proptosis and broadening of the nasal bridge, giving rise tofrog face deformity. Other features include swelling of the cheek and cranial nerve palsies (II, III,IV, and VI).",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Angiofibroma is made of vascular and fibrous tissues. Vessels of angiofibroma lack contractilecomponents, they are just endothelium-lined spaces with no elastic or muscle coat.This accounts for severe bleeding as the vessels lose the ability to contract. Hence the bleedingcannot be controlled by the application of adrenaline. Therefore, the biopsy is contraindicated.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. Investigation of choiceto diagnose this condition is contrast enhancement CT scan (CECT).MRI scan can be used complementary to CT to see soft tissue extensions of the tumor.Carotid angiography shows the extent of the tumor, its vascularity, and feeding vessels whichmostly come from the external carotid system.
