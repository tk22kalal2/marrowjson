Management of tubo-tympanic type of CSOM: Medical management: Aural toilet, Topical antibiotics with steroid drops, Systemic antibiotics, Treatment of causative factors. Surgical management: It is done once the ear is dry for 6 weeks without antibiotics. Tympanoplasty (ossiculoplasty with or without myringoplasty).",

      "explanation": "Wilde's (or post-aural) incision is used in myringoplasty. Wilde's incision is used in the following: • Cortical mastoidectomy • Modified radical and radical mastoidectomy • Tympanoplasty - when perforation extends anterior to the handle of malleus • Exposure of CN VII in the vertical segment • Surgery of the endolymphatic sac. Option A: Killian's incision is used in submucous resection surgery for a deviated nasal septum. In cases of a deviated septum, a slightly curvilinear incision is made, 2–3 mm behind the caudal end of the septal cartilage at the mucocutaneous junction, always on the left side. Option B: Freer's hemitransfixion incision is used in septoplasty done for a deviated nasal septum. In case of caudal dislocation, a transfixion or hemitransfixion incision is made. It is a septocolumellar incision between the caudal end of the septal cartilage and columella on the concave side. Option D: Gluck-Sorenson's incision is used for laryngectomy with radical neck dissection.",

        "D": "The patient is allowed to swim after the CWD procedure"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Post-surgery healing is rapid and periodic cleaning is unnecessary in the case of the canal wall up procedure (CWU). This procedure has a low predisposition to infection but carries the risk of leaving behind residual disease, requiring the need for second-look surgery. Canal wall up procedure (CWU): The meatus appears normal, does not require routine cleaning, has a high rate of recurrent or residual cholesteatoma, and requires second-look surgery after 6 months. The patient is allowed to swim; there is no limitation. It is easy to wear a hearing aid if needed. Canal wall down procedure (CWD): The meatus opening is a wide communication with the mastoid, cleaning once or twice a year is required, there is a low rate of recurrence, and second-look surgery is not required. However, swimming can lead to infection of the mastoid cavity, and there are problems in fitting a hearing aid due to the large meatus and mastoid cavity.",

      "explanation": "Battle sign refers to retro-auricular or mastoid ecchymosis that typically results from a fracture of the middle cranial fossa following head trauma. It is prominent when there is a fracture of the temporal bone. Battle sign is not seen in the case of otitis media. Option A: Bezold abscess is a complication of acute otomastoiditis where the infection/pus breaks through the thin medial side of the tip of the mastoid and presents as a swelling in the upper part of the neck. Option B: Griesinger sign refers to edema of the post-auricular soft tissues overlying the mastoid process as a result of thrombosis of the mastoid emissary vein seen in sigmoid sinus thrombosis. It is a complication of acute otomastoiditis. Option D: Delta sign is a contrast-enhanced CT finding seen in sagittal sinus thrombosis, which can occur as a complication of acute mastoiditis or chronic suppurative otitis media. It is a triangular area with rim enhancement and the central low-density area is seen in the posterior cranial fossa on axial cuts.

      "question": "A patient complains of severe pain in his right ear associated with high-grade fever and profuse ear discharge.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario of severe pain in his right ear associated with high-grade fever, profuse ear discharge, mastoid tenderness, and perforation of the tympanic membrane is suggestive of acute mastoiditis, which has most likely occurred as a complication of acute infection of the middle ear. If this infection is to burst out through the medial side of the tip of the mastoid, it results in the formation of Bezold abscess. Acute mastoiditis is used to refer to an acute infection that spreads from the mucosa lining the mastoid air cells to involve the bony walls of the mastoid air cell system. Blood leukocytes and ESR are raised. A CT scan of the temporal bone shows clouding of air cells due to the collection of exudate in them. In later stages, a cavity may be seen in the mastoid. Treatment is done by administration of intravenous antibiotics and, if indicated, surgical procedures such as myringotomy and cortical mastoidectomy. Abscesses in relation to mastoid infection are: Bezold abscess lies deep to the sternocleidomastoid and presents as a swelling in the tip of the mastoid or the angle of the jaw and is seen in the upper part of the posterior triangle or the parapharyngeal space. Other abscesses in relation to mastoid infection include post-auricular abscess, zygomatic abscess, Luc abscess, and Citelli's abscess.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of Gradenigo's syndrome, which occurs secondary to petrous apicitis. This is a complication of otitis media. The triad of Gradenigo's syndrome consists of: ● Ipsilateral abducens nerve palsy (6th nerve palsy) - external rectus palsy, • Deep ear/facial pain (5th nerve involvement), and • Persistent ear discharge (otitis media). The incidence of this syndrome has reduced with the advent of antibiotics. Option A - Following acute coalescent mastoiditis, the pus breaks through the bony wall between the mastoid antrum and the external meatus and forms Luc's abscess. The swelling can burst into the meatus, causing otorrhea. Options B and C - Nasopharyngeal carcinoma and trigeminal schwannoma can present with cranial nerve palsy, but they do not follow the above clinical course.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of lateral sinus thrombophlebitis. It is an inflammation of the inner wall of the lateral venous sinus with the formation of an intrasinus thrombus. Clinical features of lateral sinus thrombophlebitis: • Hectic picket fence fever with chills and rigors. This is due to septicemia. The clinical picture resembles malaria but lacks regularity. • Headache - In the early stage, it may be due to peri-sinus abscess and is mild. Later, it may be severe when intracranial pressure rises due to venous obstruction. • Griesinger's sign - this is due to thrombosis of the mastoid emissary vein. Edema appears over the posterior part of the mastoid. • Papilloedema - its presence depends on obstruction to venous return. It is often seen with the right sinus (which is larger than the left). • Tenderness along the jugular vein - This is seen when thrombophlebitis extends along the jugular vein. There may be associated enlargement and inflammation of the jugular chain of lymph nodes and torticollis. Investigations: • Blood culture. • CSF analysis - normal except for increased CSF pressure that helps in ruling out meningitis. • X-ray mastoid shows: • Clouding of air cells seen in acute mastoiditis. • Destruction of bone seen in cholesteatoma. • CECT shows a typical delta sign. Treatment: • Intravenous antibacterial therapy • Mastoidectomy and exposure of sinus • Ligation of internal jugular vein • Anticoagulant therapy",

Surgery is the treatment of choice in case of cholesteatoma. The continuing discharge from the granulation tissue has caused the surface epithelia of the tympanic membrane to become edematous and thickened. This gives the surface of the tympanic membrane a thickened, whitish appearance. The primary aim in surgical treatment is to remove the disease and render the ear safe, and second in priority is to preserve or reconstruct hearing, but never at the cost of the primary aim.
