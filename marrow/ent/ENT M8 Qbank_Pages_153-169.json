But in India, otosclerosis seems to predominate in males. Stapedotomy is contraindicated in children because recurrent Eustachian tube dysfunction is common in them. This can displace the prosthesis or cause acute otitis media. Measles RNA has been found in otosclerotic foci, implicating its possible role in pathogenesis.",

      "explanation": "The given image is of a normal tympanic membrane. There is bilateral conductive deafness, paracusis willis, and a normal tympanic membrane, which suggest a diagnosis of otosclerosis with matured focus. Paracusis willis - Patient hears better in noisy surroundings as other people raise their voice to be heard. The tympanic membrane has a normal appearance in most cases. This is indicative of a matured or inactive focus of otosclerotic bone. Option B: A case of CSOM will have a perforated tympanic membrane. Option C: Otosclerosis with an active focus will show the Schwartze sign. Option D: In the case of otitis media with effusion, the tympanic membrane is often dull and opaque with loss of light reflex.",

This finding, along with the history of bilateral conductive deafness, is seen in active otosclerosis. A reddish hue may be seen on the promontory through the tympanic membrane (Schwartze sign). This is indicative of an active focus with increased vascularity. The tympanic membrane is quite normal and mobile. Option A: Rising sun sign is seen in glomus tumor. Option C: Setting sun sign is an eye sign seen in hydrocephalus. Option D: Cartwheel appearance is seen in acute suppurative otitis media.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Gelle's is a tuning fork test done to clinically confirm otosclerosis in the olden days. It is based on the fact that in a normal ear, if pressure is increased in the external ear, the stapes footplate will get medialized and will stop conducting sound. But, in an ear with otosclerosis of the footplate, there will be no movements and the patient will continue to hear the sound. Thus, Gelle's test is considered positive in normal persons and in those with sensorineural hearing loss. It is negative when the ossicular chain is fixed or disconnected. Stenger's test is done to rule out malingering. Schwabach is a tuning fork test that compares the bone conduction of the patient with that of the examiner. Rinne's is a tuning fork test that compares bone conduction with air conduction.",

      "explanation": "Carhart's notch typically dips at 2000 Hz in bone conduction. Pure tone audiometry in otosclerosis: • Air conduction is poor & worse for lower frequencies. • Bone conduction is normal. • There is a large air-bone gap. • In some cases, there is a dip in the bone conduction curve. It is different at different frequencies, but the maximum dip is at 2000 Hz and is called Carhart's notch. Hearing loss in dB, Frequency in Hertz: 125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000. Carhart's notch: 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 1000. Note: Boiler's notch is a similar dip in BC and AC curve but at 4000 Hz seen in noise-induced hearing loss.",

Surgery is contraindicated if Schwartz's sign is positive. Schwartz's sign - a reddish hue is seen on the promontory through the tympanic membrane. This is indicative of an active focus with increased vascularity. In an active case of otosclerosis, medical management with sodium fluoride (NaF) is preferred because NaF hastens the maturity of the active focus in otosclerosis.

Stapedectomy is the excision of the entire stapes (superstructure + footplate) and placing a piston in its place. It is outdated. NaF is used in an active case of otosclerosis to hasten maturation. Note: Both stapedectomy and stapedotomy have been described for the treatment of otosclerosis. Even in the stapedectomy procedure, stapedotomy (drilling) has been practiced. Hence, stapedotomy is preferred over stapedectomy and is considered the treatment of choice. In the above case, since Rinne's test is negative on both ears, it indicates bilateral conductive deafness. Weber's test will lateralize to the ear with greater conductive loss.",
