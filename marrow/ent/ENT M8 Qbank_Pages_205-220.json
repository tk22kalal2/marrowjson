      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The 2nd genu of the facial nerve lies at the junction of the 3rd and the 4th intratemporal segments, between the tympanic and the mastoid segments. The 2nd genu of the facial nerve is formed where the horizontal facial nerve takes a turn inferiorly at the junction between the medial and posterior walls of the middle ear. It continues as the vertical segment of the facial nerve behind the posterior wall of the middle ear. It does not contain a ganglion and does not give any branches. The course of the facial nerve has three parts: intracranial, intratemporal, and extracranial. The intratemporal part of the facial nerve has four segments: meatal, labyrinthine, tympanic/horizontal, and mastoid/vertical segments. Option A: The Gasserian ganglion is present in the trigeminal nerve. Option B: The temporal segment of the facial nerve ends with the 2nd genu. The nerve then passes vertically downward to form the mastoid segment. The 2nd branch of the facial nerve (nerve to stapedius) arises from this segment close to the level of the 2nd genu and not from the 2nd genu.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The shortest and narrowest segment of the facial nerve is the labyrinthine segment (length 4.0mm, diameter 0.61-0.68 mm). The labyrinthine segment is from the fundus of the meatus to the geniculate ganglion, where the nerve takes a turn posteriorly, forming a genu. The nerve in the labyrinthine segment has the narrowest diameter, and the bony canal in this segment is also the narrowest. Thus, edema or inflammation can easily compress the nerve and cause paralysis.",
