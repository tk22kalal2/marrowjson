      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is also known as Guangdong tumor. This is because the SouthernChinese province of Guangdong has the highest prevalence of the tumor.Chinese, especially from southeastern China (Canton), have a higher genetic susceptibility tonasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). Chinese emigrants are also genetically more susceptible, however,the susceptibility falls in subsequent generations.Other South-East Asian countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and people of Mongoloid originare also more susceptible.",

      "explanation": "Human papillomavirus is not associated with a high incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma inhigh-risk populations of China. EBV (Epstein Barr virus) causes nasopharyngeal carcinoma.HPV(Human papillomavirus) causes inverted papilloma of the nose.High-risk populations such as the Chinese have a very high incidence of nasopharyngealcarcinoma. The following factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis:• Burning of incense or wood (polycyclic hydrocarbons)• Consumption of preserved salted fish (nitrosamines)• Vitamin C deficient diet (vitamin C blocks nitrosification of amines and is thus protective)511",
