      "explanation": "Parapharyngeal abscess has a preponderance for male gender.Parapharyngeal abscess is an emergency condition. Infection can spread to the parapharyngealspace from any of the other deep neck spaces - peritonsillar, retropharyngeal and submandibularspaces. It commonly spreads from a dental infection, tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscesses. Thepatient is usually systemically unwell, with severe trismus and possibly airway compromise.Initial broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics should include cover against streptococci andanaerobic organisms.Carotid sheath vessel thrombosis, necrotizing fasciitis and mediastinitis are some of thecomplications.Marked neck swelling, airway compromise, and male gender appear to be predictive of higher-riskcases.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Trismus is not a feature of infection of the post-styloid compartment of the parapharyngeal space.Trismus is seen in pre-styloid abscess due to the involvement of medial pterygoid muscle.Parapharyngeal space is divided into two compartments by the styloid process and itsattachments. Clinical features depend on the compartment involved.In a post-styloid abscess, there is a bulge of the pharynx behind the posterior pillar, accompaniedby paralysis of cranial nerves IX, X (resulting in vocal cord paralysis), XI, XII, and the sympatheticchain, which can manifest as Horner's syndrome. Swelling in the parotid region may also bepresent. Notably, trismus, the inability to fully open the mouth, is usually absent in this type ofabscess.A pre-styloid abscess exhibits distinct features including the prolapse of the tonsil and tonsillarfossa, along with trismus caused by the spasm of the medial pterygoid muscle. Markedodynophagia is common. Additionally, an external swelling can be observed behind the angle ofthe jaw.Fever, sore throat, torticollis (caused by spasm of the prevertebral muscles), and signs of systemictoxicity are common features.Diagnosis can be established using a contrast-enhanced CT scan (CECT). If there is suspicion ofthrombosis of the internal jugular vein or an aneurysm of the internal carotid artery, magneticresonance arteriography (MRA) can be useful.Patients require intravenous antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, carbapenemantibiotics plus drugs that target anaerobic organisms, such as clindamycin or metronidazole. Aparapharyngeal abscess is drained by an external horizontal incision made on the skin a fewcentimeters below the angle of the mandible.The image attached below shows the components of both spaces:490Pre-styloid and Post-styloid components ofParapharyngeal sapceMaxillaPost-styloidcompartment=PrestyloidfatPre-styloidcompartmentMandibleStyloid processCarotid sheathCervical sympathetic chainOMARROWBoth lobeof parotid",

Ludwig's angina is an infection of the submandibular space.

The two compartments are continuous around the posterior border of the mylohyoid muscle. Both compartments freely communicate in the midline with the opposite side. Therefore, infection rapidly becomes bilateral. The most common cause of Ludwig's angina is dental infections (accounting for 80% of cases).",

      "explanation": "In a case of a parotid abscess, one must never wait for fluctuation or pus point to occur. This isbecause the superficial layer of parotidomasseteric fascia is tense and the fluctuation will beapparent only in later stages.A parotid abscess refers to an infection and pus formation in the parotid space. It is caused mostcommonly by Staphylococcus aureus. Post-surgical cases and debilitated patients with stasis ofsalivary flow are at risk of developing parotid abscesses.Patients typically present with unilateral swelling, redness, induration, and tenderness over theparotid gland and angle of the mandible. Dehydration and fever are also present. Diagnosis is byultrasonography or a CT scan. Multiple small loculi of pus are seen in the parenchyma. Aspirationof abscess can be done to determine the culture and sensitivity of the infective agent.494Correction of dehydration, improving oral hygiene and promoting salivary flow. Intravenousantibiotics are also used in treatment.Surgical drainage under local or general anesthesia is carried out by a preauricular incision asemployed for parotidectomy. A skin flap is raised to expose the surface of the gland, and theabscess or abscesses are bluntly opened working parallel to the branches of the VIIth nerve. Theskin incision is loosely approximated over a drain and allowed to heal by secondary intention.495",
