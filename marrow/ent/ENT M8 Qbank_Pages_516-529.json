Secondary elevators act indirectly as they are attached to the hyoid bone and include Mylohyoid (main) • Digastric • Stylohyoid • Geniohyoid. Depressors: • Sternohyoid • Sternothyroid • Omohyoid. Easy to remember: Check the other attachment (non-laryngeal side). If it's above the level of the hyoid, the muscle is an elevator. If it's below the level of the hyoid, it's a depressor.",
