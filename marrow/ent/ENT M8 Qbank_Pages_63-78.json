      "explanation": "The electrode of a cochlear implant is placed in the scala tympani. It allows for the electrodes to be in close proximity to the ganglion cells and their dendrites, which are located in the modiolus and bony spiral lamina of the cochlea. A cochlear implant is an electronic device for severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and for those who cannot benefit from a hearing aid. It converts sound to an electrical signal (transduction) and delivers this to the auditory nerve. Prerequisites include an intact cochlear nerve and higher auditory pathway. In the auditory brainstem implant, the site of the implant is the lateral recess of the fourth ventricle. It is used when the cochlear nerve is not intact.",
