      "explanation": "The above image shows intraosseous cannulation for fluid transfusion in the anterior proximal tibia. The intraosseous route is an alternative to the intravenous (IV) route in the transfusion of fluids in shock. The marrow of long bones has a rich network of vessels that drain into a central venous canal, emissary veins, and ultimately the central circulation. So, the bone marrow functions as a non-collapsible venous access route. Intraosseous cannulation is recommended for patients in whom IV access proves difficult or unattainable (e.g., in cardiopulmonary arrest). In such a case, if venous access is not available within 1 minute, an intraosseous needle should be placed in the anterior proximal tibia. Insertion sites for intraosseous infusion: in the proximal tibia, 1-2 cm anteromedial from the tibial tuberosity; distal tibia at the junction of the medial malleolus and the shaft of the tibia; and the distal one-third of the femur.",

      "explanation": "Zinc supplementation is usually given for a duration of 10 to 14 days. Age <6 months: 10 mg/day. Age >6 months: 20 mg/day. Zinc administration for diarrhea management can significantly reduce mortality and hospital admission. In addition, it improves diarrhea recovery rates and reduces the inappropriate use of antimicrobials. Excessive zinc therapy can lead to copper deficiency syndrome, hence requires the regular monitoring of plasma zinc and copper concentrations.",

But, the weight of the child here is 7 Kg, which suggests that the child is malnourished. The child may be having edematous malnutrition (kwashiorkor), where skin may go back to the original position even in the presence of dehydration. Hence, the skin pinch is not reliable for the assessment of dehydration in this child. Reliable indicators of dehydration in the malnourished child include eagerness to drink, cool and moist extremities, weak radial pulse, and reduced urine flow.",

      "question": "Detailed ExplanationsIn an infant with diarrhoea, the initial fluid of choice is oral rehydration solution (ORS).The glucose-dependent sodium and water absorption is the principle behind replacing glucose andsodium in a 1:1 molar ratio in the WHO oral rehydration solution (ORS). The low osmolarity of theORS in the lumen as compared to the blood facilitate absorption of fluid and hence theelectrolytes due to the solvent drag.Studies have shown that low osmolarity ORS causes reduction of stool output, decrease invomiting and decrease in the use of unscheduled intravenous fluids without increasing the risk ofhyponatremia. Other home available fluids that can be used are salted rice water/salted yoghurtdrinks, vegetable/chicken soup with salt.ReSoMal is given to severely malnourished children. In this case, since the infant's weight isappropriate for its age ORS is given.Solution to Question 2:The amount of total body water (TBW) in a term neonate is approximately 75% of the birthweight.So, in this case, 75% of 3kg is 2.25 litres.-Note TBW is 90% in early fetal life and becomes 60% by the end of the first year and stays thesame till puberty.Solution to Question 3:The above image shows intraosseous cannulation for fluid transfusion in the anterior proximaltibia.The intraosseous route is an alternative to the intravenous (IV) route in the transfusion of fluids inshock.• The marrow of long bones has a rich network of vessels that drain into a central venous canal,emissary veins, and ultimately the central circulation.•So, the bone marrow functions as a non-collapsible venous access route.Intraosseous cannulation is recommended for patients in whom IV access proves difficult orunattainable.

Irreversible centralDI follows most cases of complete resections of craniopharyngioma.Serum osmolality of &gt;295 mOsm/L (normal: 280-295 mOsm/L) and the urine osmolalityof &lt;300 mOsm/L (normal: 500-850mOsm/L) are suggestive of DI. A water deprivation test isdone to further classify the types of DI.Option A: In postoperative patients, because of IV fluids there is an acute expansion of ECFvolume. This suppresses high ADH activity and causes diuresis with normal serum osmolality.Option B: In SIADH, serum osmolality is decreased.Option D: In cerebral salt-wasting syndrome there is hypersecretion ANP and their levelsare usually elevated.Solution to Question 5:Zinc supplementation is usually given for a duration of 10 to 14 days.•Age &lt;6 months: 10 mg/day• Age &gt;6 months: 20 mg/dayZinc administration for diarrhoea management can significantly reduce mortality and hospitaladmission.In addition, it improves diarrhoea recovery rates and reduces the inappropriate use ofantimicrobials.Excessive zinc therapy can lead to copper deficiency syndrome, hence requires the regularmonitoring of plasma zinc and copper concentrations.Solution to Question 6:The child in this scenario has some degree of dehydration, since the child is restless and irritable,drinks water readily, has sunken eyes, and the skin goes back slowly on the skin pinch test (&lt;2seconds) with sunken eyes.174Treatment includes oral rehydration therapy and zinc supplementation according to WHOIntegrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Diseases (IMNCI) Protocol, Plan B.WHO IMNCI PLANS:SIGNSCLASSIFY ASTwo of the following signs:SEVEREDEHYDRATIONLethargic orunconsciousSunken eyesNot able to drink ordrinking poorlySkin pinch goes backvery slowlyTwo of the following signs:Restless, irritableSOMEDEHYDRATIONSunken eyesDrinks eagerly, thirstySkin pinch goes backslowly.Not enough signs toclassify as some orNODEHYDRATIONsevere dehydrationDoes the child have diarrhoea?IF YES, ASK: LOOK AND FEEL:For how long?Is there blood in thestool?IDENTIFY TREATMENT(Urgent pre-referral treatments are in bold print)If child has no other severe classification- Give fluid for severe dehydration (Plan C).ORIf child also has another severe classification:Refer URGENTLY to hospital with mother givingfrequent sips of ORS on the way.

The child may be having edematousmalnutrition (kwashiorkor), where skin may go back to the original position even in the presenceof dehydration. Hence, the skin pinch is not reliable for the assessment of dehydration in thischild.Reliable indicators of dehydration in the malnourished child include•Eagerness to drink• Cool and moist extremities• Weak radial pulse• Reduced urine flowSolution to Question 10:Hypernatremic dehydration is the most dangerous type of dehydration.Hypernatremia causes movement of water from brain cells into hypertonic extracellular fluid,causing brain cell shrinkage and shearing of blood vessels within brain. This leads to centralnervous system hemorrhages and thrombosis.The fluid deficit is corrected slowly as rapid treatment of hypernatremic dehydration causesmovement of water from the extracellular space into brain cells, leading to cerebral edema,seizures, brain herniation, and even death.Solution to Question 11:Through a peripheral vascular line, a maximum of 12.5% dextrose can be infused.176The dextrose concentration greater than 12.5% has an acidic pH and can cause irritation to theperipheral veins, which can lead to thrombophlebitis.Note:Central vein lines can be used for 25% D if needed.Solution to Question 12:The daily maintenance fluid required for a child weighing 30 Kg is 1700 ml.Bodyweight method for calculating the daily maintenance fluid volume (also known asHolliday-Segar metho",
        "D": "is used.Calculation:In the question, the weight of the child is given as 30 Kgs.So, the formula for &gt;20 Kg is used.1500 mL + (20 mL x weight more than 20 Kgs)Since the child weight is 30 Kgs, he/she is 10 Kgs more.Therefore, fluid required is==1500 mL + (20 mL x 10)1500 mL + 200 mL= 1700 mL.Bodywei Fluid required per dayght0-10 Kg100 mL/kg11-20 Kg>20 Kg1000 mL + 50 mL/Kg for each Kg >10 Kg1500 mL + 20 mL/Kg for each Kg >20 kgSolution to"
