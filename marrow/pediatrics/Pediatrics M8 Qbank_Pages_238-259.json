      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The clinical vignette describes a case of phenylketonuria. CNS damage in patients withphenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by hyperphenylalaninemia in brain tissue.High blood levels of phenylalanine saturate the transport system across the blood-brain barriercausing inhibition of the cerebral uptake of other large neutral amino acids such as tyrosine andtryptophan impairing brain protein synthesis.Microcephaly, prominent maxillae with widely spaced teeth, enamel hypoplasia, and growthretardation are other common findings in untreated children. Low bone mineral density andosteopenia have been reported in affected individuals of all ages.Excess phenylalanine is metabolized to phenyl ketones (phenylpyruvate and phenylacetate) thatare excreted in the urine. However, these metabolites have no role in the pathogenesis of CNSdamage; their presence in body fluids simply signifies the severity of the condition.247Hypotyrosinemia can be partially responsible for the signs and symptoms but the primary cause ishyperphenylalaninemia.Laboratory diagnoses of phenylketonuria include:• Guthrie's test: growth of bacillus subtilis is seen• Ferric chloride urine test: transient blue-green color• Blood phenylalanine levels: elevated.•• Enzyme studies• Genetic mutation studies• Tandem mass spectrometry: Gold standard screening method for all metabolic disorders.",

      "explanation": "A low-phenylalanine diet is the mainstay of treatment of PKU.The goal of therapy is to reduce phenylalanine levels in the plasma and brain. Becausephenylalanine is not synthesized endogenously, small amounts of phenylalanine should be addedto the diet to prevent phenylalanine deficiency. Dietary deficiency of this amino acid is manifestedby lethargy, failure to thrive, anorexia, anemia, rashes, diarrhea, and even death; moreover,tyrosine becomes an essential amino acid in this disorder and its adequate intake must beensured.Sapropterin dihydrochloride, a synthetic form of BH4, which acts as a cofactor in patients withresidual PAH activity, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reducephenylalanine levels in PKU.",

Their decarboxylation is accomplished by BCKDH using thiamine (vitamin B1)pyrophosphate as a coenzyme.Leucine is metabolized by BCAA aminotransferase to α-ketoisocaproic acid, which leads to thedisrupted metabolism of neurotransmitters and amino acids (glutamate, GABA, glutamine,256alanine, and aspartate). α-Ketoisocaproic acid can reversibly inhibit oxidative phosphorylationand result in cerebral lactic acidosis. Collectively, these processes are detrimental to the normalfunction of neurons and glia, clinically manifesting as encephalopathy and brain edema andreferred to as leucinosis.Treatment options include hemodialysis, restricting dietary substances, thiamine for milderforms, and orthotopic liver transplant.",

It is characterized by alopecia,ataxia, ketoacidosis, dermatitis, seizures, myoclonus, and nystagmus.Both infantile and late-onset multiple carboxylase deficiency can be treated with pharmacologicaldoses of biotin.It is called multiple carboxylase deficiency because biotin is a water-soluble vitamin that is acofactor for all 4 carboxylase enzymes in humans:• Pyruvate carboxylase• Acetyl CoA carboxylase• Propionyl CoA carboxylase• 3-methylcrotonyl CoA carboxylaseNote:Acquired deficiency of biotin may occur in infants receiving total parenteral nutrition withoutadded biotin, in patients with prolonged use of antiepileptic drugs (phenobarbital, phenytoin,primidone, carbamazepine), and in children with short bowel syndrome or chronic diarrhea whoare receiving formulas low in biotin. Excessive ingestion of raw eggs may also cause biotindeficiency because the protein avidin in egg white binds biotin, decreasing its absorption. Infantswith a biotin deficiency may develop dermatitis, alopecia, and candidal skin infections. This257condition readily responds to treatment with oral biotin.",

      "question": "Detailed ExplanationsMousy odor is characteristically seen in phenylketonuria due to excess phenylacetate (phenylketone) formed in the body.In the absence of phenylalanine hydroxylase, phenylalanine enters into alternate metabolicpathways which result in the formation of phenyl lactate, phenylacetate, andphenylacetylglutamine.Solution to Question 2:The clinical vignette describes a case of phenylketonuria. CNS damage in patients withphenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by hyperphenylalaninemia in brain tissue.High blood levels of phenylalanine saturate the transport system across the blood-brain barriercausing inhibition of the cerebral uptake of other large neutral amino acids such as tyrosine andtryptophan impairing brain protein synthesis.Microcephaly, prominent maxillae with widely spaced teeth, enamel hypoplasia, and growthretardation are other common findings in untreated children. Low bone mineral density andosteopenia have been reported in affected individuals of all ages.Excess phenylalanine is metabolized to phenyl ketones (phenylpyruvate and phenylacetate) thatare excreted in the urine. However, these metabolites have no role in the pathogenesis of CNSdamage; their presence in body fluids simply signifies the severity of the condition.247Hypotyrosinemia can be partially responsible for the signs and symptoms but the primary cause ishyperphenylalaninemia.Laboratory diagnoses of phenylketonuria include:• Guthrie's test: growth of bacillus subtilis is seen• Ferric chloride urine test: transient blue-green color• Blood phenylalanine levels: elevated.•• Enzyme studies• Genetic mutation studies• Tandem mass spectrometry: Gold standard screening method for all metabolic disorders.Solution to Question 3:Defects of either phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) or tetrahydrobiopterin(BH4) can causehyperphenylalaninemias.PAH deficiency is diagnosed as phenylketonuria.Malignant hyperphenylalaninemias include three enzyme defects, dihydropteridinereductase, pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase, and GTP cyclohydrolase which help in BH4synthesis. The deficiency of BH4 impairs three hydroxylase (phenylalanine, tyrosine, andtryptophan), and severe neurological symptoms develop because of the lack of neurotransmitters.Dihydropteroate synthase is present only in bacteria and this makes it a useful target forsulfonamide antibiotics, which compete with the PABA precursor.Solution to Question 4:A low-phenylalanine diet is the mainstay of treatment of PKU.The goal of therapy is to reduce phenylalanine levels in the plasma and brain. Becausephenylalanine is not synthesized endogenously, small amounts of phenylalanine should be addedto the diet to prevent phenylalanine deficiency. Dietary deficiency of this amino acid is manifestedby lethargy, failure to thrive, anorexia, anemia, rashes, diarrhea, and even death; moreover,tyrosine becomes an essential amino acid in this disorder and its adequate intake must beensured.Sapropterin dihydrochloride, a synthetic form of BH4, which acts as a cofactor in patients withresidual PAH activity, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FD",

The treatment of choice is nitisinone (NTBC), which inhibits 4-HPPD and reduces theflux of tyrosine metabolites to FAH, thus decreasing the production of the offending compounds,fumarylacetoacetate, and succinylacetone.Tyrosine MetabolismTyrosinetransaminaseL-Tyrosinea-KGPLPGlup-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate[Q]p-HydroxyphenylpyruvatehydroxylaseCO2Homogentisate[O]HomogentisateoxidaseFe2+MaleylacetoacetateMaleylacetoacetateCis, trans isomeraseGlutathioneFumarylacetoacetateH₂OFumarateB-KetothiolasetAcetoacetaterAcetyl-CoACOASHAcetateOMARROWSolution to Question 6:Corneal ulceration is not a feature of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1. In fact, ocular manifestationsare a feature of hereditary tyrosinemia type 2 which presumably occur due to tyrosine deposition.Boiled cabbage odor may be present in tyrosinemia resulting from increased methioninemetabolites (sulfur-containing compounds).Features of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (hepatorenal tyrosinemia):• An acute hepatic crisis commonly heralds the onset of disease, which may progress to liverfailure, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death.•Episodes of acute peripheral neuropathy resembling porphyrias often triggered by a minorinfection, such crisis can be associated with paralytic ileus•Renal involvement, which is manifested as a Fanconi-like syndrome with hyperphosphaturia,hypophosphatemia, normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, and vitamin D-resistant rickets249The treatment of choice for HT Type 1 is nitisinone, which blocks early steps in the tyrosinedegradation pathway and limits the formation of toxic tyrosine metabolites.Note:Boiled cabbage odor can also be found in cases of Hypermethioninemia.Solution to Question 7:Palmar and plantar hyperkeratosis, herpetiform corneal ulcers, and intellectual disability are seenin hereditary tyrosinemia type 2 (Richner-Hanhart syndrome/ oculocutaneous tyrosinemia)Treatment with a diet low in tyrosine and phenylalanine aiming to achieve plasma tyrosine levels&lt;500 μmol/L improves skin and eye manifestations.The image below shows herpetiform corneal ulcer:Solution to Question 8:Oculocutaneous tyrosinemia/Richner-Hanhart syndrome (type II) is caused by the deficiency oftyrosine aminotransferase.It is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by palmar and plantar hyperkeratosis,herpetiform corneal ulcers, and intellectual disability. Untreated patients havemarked hypertyrosinemia.

In symptomatic patients, developmental delay, seizures, intermittent ataxia,and self-injurious behavior have been reported. Liver and renal abnormalities are absent.Note:Transient tyrosinemia of the newborn is the most common acquired cause for increased plasmatyrosine levels. Seen in premature infants receiving a high protein diet and due to the immaturityof 4-HPPD enzyme. Mostly asymptomatic, but sometimes manifested by lethargy, poor feeding,and decreased motor activity. Hypertyrosinemia usually resolvesspontaneously in the first 2 months of life.

Mental development is usually normal. Affectedindividuals excrete hawkinsin (4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid), and its metabolites.Treatment consists of a low-protein diet during infancy. Breastfeeding is encouraged. A trial withlarge doses of vitamin C (up to 1,000 mg/24 hour) is also recommended.Solution to Question 11:The following condition is characterized by the deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase.The image represents ochronosis: Bluish-black pigmentation of the ear cartilage and/or sclera dueto deposits of accumulated homogentisic acid.This is characteristically seen in alkaptonuria. It is a rare autosomal-recessive disorder is causedby the deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase. Large amounts of homogentisic acid are formed,which are excreted in urine or deposited in tissues. Clinical manifestations of alkaptonuria consistof ochronosis and arthritis in adulthood. Arthritis predominantly involves the spine, hip, andknee. Radiologically, it is characterized by intervertebral calcifications. In children, blackening ofthe urine on standing is observed; it is caused by the oxidation and polymerization ofhomogentisic acid.252Solution to Question 12:The clinical image shows the accumulation of alkapton bodies in connective tissues on the faceand urine turning brownish-black on standing are associatedwith alkaptonuria. X-ray shows calcification of intervertebral discs called ochronoticspondyloarthropathy also seen in alkaptonuria. Nitisinone can be used in the treatment ofalkaptonuria.Nitisinone, formerly known as NTBC, inhibits 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD)(early step in the tyrosine degradation pathway) and efficiently reduces homogentisic acidproduction in alkaptonuria. Treatment of arthritis is symptomatic. In presymptomatic individuals,treatment using a combination of nitisinone with phenylalanine and a tyrosine restricted diet canbe tried.The patient's urine contains elevated levels of homogentisic acid, which is oxidized to a darkpigment on standing as shown below in the image:Solution to Question 13:The clinical vignette describes a thrombotic stroke in the left MCA territory.

The most common inbornerror of methionine metabolism.⚫ Defects in methylcobalamin formation: Methylcobalamin is the cofactor for the enzymemethionine synthase, which catalyzes the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine.• Deficiency of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase: This enzyme reduces 5,10methylenetetrahydrofolate to form 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which provides the methyl groupneeded for remethylation of homocysteine to methionine.253• Pyridoxine deficiency: B6 is the co-factor for the enzyme cystathionine ẞ-synthaseFolateCauses of homocystinuriaDietary proteinsTetrahydrofolate5.10-MethylenetetrahydrofolateMethylenetetrahydrofolate reductaseMethionineTransmethylationMethioninesynthaseVitamin B5-MethylenetetrahydrofolateMADimethylglycine.Betaine-homocysteinemethyltransferaseHomocysteinet +BetaineCystathioninep-synthase+Vitamin B₁LCystathionineCysteineOMARROWWMetabolic disorders which can cause stroke include:• Homocystinuria•MELAS (metabolic encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes)• Leigh syndrome•Fabry's disease•Propionic acidemia•Glutaric aciduriaVitamin C deficiency increases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.Solution to Question 14:The above findings support a diagnosis of homocystinuria. Short stature is not a manifestation ofhomocystinuria.Manifestations of homocystinuria:•Ectopia lentis - downward and inward subluxation (inferonasal).• Intellectual disability and psychiatric and behavioral disorders•⚫ Thromboembolic episodes like stroke and MI• Skeletal abnormalities resembling those of Marfan syndrome: They are tall and thin, (NOT short)with elongated limbs and arachnodactyly.Solution to Question 15:254Pellagra-like symptoms- photosensitive dermatitis, diarrhea, and episodic depression are seen inthe deficiency of tryptophan.Niacin is not strictly a vitamin, since it can be synthesized in the body from the essential aminoacid tryptophan; deficiency of tryptophan causes pellagra-like symptoms.Treatment with nicotinic acid or nicotinamide (50-300 mg/24 hr) and a high protein diet resultsin a favorable response in symptomatic patients with Hartnup disease.The image below shows Casal's necklace, a lesion seen around the neck which is caused due to thedeficiency of niacin or nicotinic acid.Casal's paint necklace in PellagraSolution to Question 16:The treatment of Hartnup disease is not with the supplementation of tryptophan.Hartnup disease• It is caused by a defect in the transport of monoamino-monocarboxylic (neutral) amino acids,including tryptophan, by the intestinal mucosa and renal tubules.•There is a defect in BOAT1 protein in the intestine/ renal tubules or both, which is caused by amutation in SLC6A19.•Tryptophan is an essential amino acid and a precursor for nicotinic acid (niacin) and serotonin.Decreased intestinal absorption of tryptophan in conjunction with its increased renal loss causesreduced availability of tryptophan for niacin synthesis in affected individuals.• A pellagra-like rash may develop in symptomatic patients, and some patients may haveintermittent ataxia.• Diagnosis is based on aminoaciduria and increased excretion of indole compounds detectedby Obermeyer test.• Treatment is with nicotinic acid or nicotinamide and a high-protein diet.255Solution to Question 17:In this case, hyperammonemia +, acidosis +, ketosis +. This is seen in organic aciduria.Organic acidemias most commonly present in infancy with poor feeding, vomiting, hypotonia,high anion gap metabolic acidosis, hepatomegaly, seizures.
