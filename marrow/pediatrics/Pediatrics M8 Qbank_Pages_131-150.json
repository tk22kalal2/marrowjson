      "explanation": "The girl is suffering from measles. It is associated with vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A deficiency is associated with an increased risk of infection and increased mortality with a variety of infectious diseases, particularly measles. Hence, vitamin A therapy is indicated in all patients with measles. The main functions of vitamin A are as follows: • Maintenance of vision, especially night vision • Maintenance of epithelial tissues • Differentiation of various tissues, particularly during reproduction and gestation, by regulating gene expression. Features of vitamin A deficiency: • Eyes: Defective dark adaptation is a characteristic early clinical feature, resulting in night blindness (earliest manifestation). This can further progress to xerophthalmia, Bitot's spots, conjunctivitis, or keratomalacia, leading to blindness. • Poor overall growth, anemia • Diarrhea, susceptibility to infections • Increased intracranial pressure • Keratinization of mucous membranes and skin (hyperkeratosis)",

      "explanation": "The given clinical image is showing Bitot spots, which occur due to keratinization of the conjunctival epithelium. Bitot spots are triangular, frequently bilateral, and present on the bulbar conjunctiva. Normally, bulbar conjunctiva is a stratified, columnar, non-keratinized epithelium. In vitamin A deficiency, there is squamous metaplasia of the conjunctival epithelium and tangles of keratin admixed with gas-forming bacteria producing a dry, scaly patch with a foamy appearance called Bitot spots. Option A: Deposition of calcium in the conjunctiva is termed conjunctival concretions, which usually occurs over the palpebral conjunctiva, in chronic inflammatory conditions of the eye. Option B: Scarring of the conjunctiva is seen in chlamydial infection of the eye. Option C: Excessive growth of conjunctival tissue is seen in the pterygium of the eye.",

      "explanation": "Both hypervitaminosis A and deficiency of vitamin A cause raised intracranial pressure (ICP) (not just hypervitaminosis A). 11-cis retinal (not trans) is required for vision. Hypervitaminosis A causes headache, vomiting, desquamation of the skin, and hyperostosis of long bones. Rupture of lysosomes in the cells is the pathological feature of hypervitaminosis A. All-trans retinoic acid is the most bioactive form of vitamin A, and it is required for cell differentiation and the regulation of transcription. On the other hand, 11-cis retinal is required for vision. Protein-energy malnutrition can cause vitamin A deficiency because of the impaired synthesis of retinol-binding protein (RBP).",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Vitamin E/Tocopherol is a potent antioxidant and is helpful in preventing hair fall. It promotes hair growth and prevents hair roots from getting damaged by free radical injury. Alpha-tocopherol is the active component of vitamin E and it is mainly located within cell membranes, preventing lipid peroxidation and the formation of free radicals. Deficiency of this can also lead to neurological defects, hemolysis, and posterior column defect. Treatment includes vitamin E supplementation (25–50 units/day for a week). Note: The other vitamins having antioxidant properties are vitamins A, C, and E (vitamin E is the most important). The other vitamin beneficial in the treatment of hair fall is biotin.",

PHEX gene (phosphate-regulating endopeptidase on x chromosome) products areresponsible for the inactivation of phosphatonin. Mutation of this PHEX leads to increasedphosphatonin (FGF 23) levels, and hence, the excretion of phosphorous is increased.

      "explanation": "Vitamin K deficiency occurs mostly in breastfed infants, not in artificial milk-fed babies, as the formula milk is fortified. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that eliminate the intestinal vitamin K2-producing bacteria can cause vitamin K deficiency. Biliary atresia causes malabsorption of vitamin K, due to defective fat absorption. There are three forms of vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) of the newborn: Early VKDB of the newborn is prevented by the administration of a single intramuscular (IM) injection of vitamin K (1 mg) at birth. Secondary to maternal intake, Early VKDB (classic hemorrhagic disease of the newborn) occurs from 1 to 14 days. Late VKDB occurs from 2 to 12 weeks, often in breastfed babies and in those with malabsorption of vitamin K (cystic fibrosis, biliary atresia).",
