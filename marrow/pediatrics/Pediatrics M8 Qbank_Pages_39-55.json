      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "In craniosynostosis, infants have small fontanelles. Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of cranial sutures. An infant has two fontanelles at birth, the diamond-shaped anterior fontanelle and the triangular posterior fontanelle. Closure of the anterior fontanelle occurs at 18 months. Closure of the posterior fontanelle occurs by the 6th - 8th week after birth; its persistence suggests underlying hydrocephalus or congenital hypothyroidism. The presence of a third fontanelle may suggest trisomy 21 or prematurity. The persistence of excessively large anterior fontanelles and small fontanelles has been associated with several disorders: Large fontanelles - Achondroplasia, Cleidocranial dysostosis, Congenital rubella syndrome, Hydrocephaly. Small fontanelles - Microcephaly, Craniosynostosis, Congenital hyperthyroidism, Wormian bones, Osteogenesis imperfecta, Prematurity, Russell-Silver syndrome, Trisomies 13, 18, and 21, Vitamin D deficiency, rickets.",

Subtle seizures are the most common type of seizures in neonates with HIE. Neonatal seizures: \n   • Most common type - Subtle seizures\n   • Least common type - Myoclonic seizures\n   • Most common metabolic cause - Hypoglycemia\n   • Investigation of choice for the diagnosis of seizures - Electroencephalogram (EEG)\n   • Neuroimaging modality of choice for etiological evaluation - MRI\n   • Drug of choice - Phenobarbitone",

      "question": "A 2-day-old neonate was admitted to the NICU after he was observed to have movements as shown in the clip. His APGAR scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. His blood sugar was within the normal range in the first 24 hours. What is the likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Focal tonic seizure",
        "B": "Focal clonic seizure",
        "C": "Spasms",
        "D": "Subtle seizure"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The video clip of a 2-day-old neonate exhibiting repetitive, rhythmic movement in unilateral upper and lower limbs suggests a neonatal seizure of focal clonic type. A focal clonic seizure is characterized by multiple, repetitive, rhythmic contractions of muscle groups of the limbs, face, or trunk, maybe unifocal or multifocal. It may occur synchronously or asynchronously in muscle groups on one side of the body. It may occur simultaneously but asynchronously on both sides. It cannot be suppressed by restraint. Other options: Option A: Focal tonic seizures are characterized by sustained posturing of a single limb, sustained asymmetrical posturing of the trunk, and sustained eye deviation. They cannot be provoked by stimulation or suppressed by restraint. Option C: Spasms are sudden generalized jerks lasting 1-2 seconds and are usually associated with a single, very brief, generalized discharge. They may be flexor, extensor, or mixed extensor/flexor and can occur in clusters. They too cannot be provoked by stimulation or suppressed by restraint. Option D: Subtle seizures include transient eye deviations, nystagmus, blinking, mouthing, abnormal extremity movements (rowing, swimming, cycling, pedaling), fluctuations in heart rate, hypertension episodes, and apnea. They are more common in preterm than in term babies. Myoclonic seizures are random, single, rapid muscle contractions of the limbs, face, or trunk. They are not repetitive or may recur at a slow rate. They can be generalized, focal, or fragmentary. They can be provoked by stimulation. Clinically apparent seizures in a neonate should be treated if they last >3 minutes or are brief serial seizures. In all neonates with seizures, hypoglycemia, CNS infection, and hypocalcemia should be ruled out before starting anti-epileptic drug treatment. Causes of neonatal seizure according to the age of presentation: 1 to 4 days: Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, maternal use of narcotics or barbiturates, drug toxicity: lidocaine, penicillin, intraventricular hemorrhage, hypocalcemia, sepsis, hypoglycemia, hypomagnesemia, hypo or hypernatremia, galactosemia, urea cycle disorders. 4 to 14 days: Meningitis (bacterial), encephalitis (enteroviral, herpes simplex), hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, galactosemia, fructosemia, hyperinsulinism, hyperammonemia syndrome. 2 to 8 weeks: Herpes simplex or enteroviral encephalitis, bacterial meningitis, subdural hematoma, child abuse, aminoaciduria, urea cycle defects, malformations of cortical development, tuberous sclerosis, Sturge-Weber syndrome.",

      "explanation": "Late-onset sepsis usually presents after 72 hours of age (not 48 hours). Neutropenia appears to be a better predictor of neonatal sepsis (not neutrophilia). Neonatal sepsis is a clinical syndrome characterized by signs and symptoms of infection, with or without accompanying bacteremia in the first month of life. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella spp. are the predominant organisms involved. Organisms such as Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and coagulase-negative staphylococci are also important pathogens in hospital-acquired infections. Early-onset sepsis and late-onset sepsis: Presentation, Source of infection, and Manifestation. Within the first 72 hours of life, after 72 hours of life, maternal genital tract, nosocomial or community-acquired, respiratory distress and pneumonia, septicemia, pneumonia, or meningitis.",

      "explanation": "Bacterial growth in the umbilical tip and blood cultures on day 8 suggests a hospital-acquired infection after 72 hours. This is late-onset neonatal sepsis. The most common manifestation of late-onset neonatal sepsis is meningitis. Early-onset sepsis, Late-onset sepsis: Presentation, Source of infection, Presents within first 72 hours of life, Maternal genital tract, Presents after 72 hours of life, Nosocomial or community-acquired. NOTE: Early-onset sepsis, Late-onset sepsis: Manifestation, Respiratory distress and pneumonia, Septicemia, pneumonia, or meningitis. Traditionally, neonatal sepsis had been classified as EOS (<7 days) and LOS (>7 days), but recently, experts have come to believe that Early-onset neonatal sepsis manifests within the first 72 hours of life and Late-onset neonatal sepsis after 72 hours of life.",

The various components of the septic screen include: Total leukocyte count (TLC), Absolute neutrophil count (ANC), Immature: Total neutrophil ratio (IT), Micro-erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein.

      "explanation": "Buphthalmos is not a normal finding in a newborn; it is suggestive of congenital glaucoma and should, therefore, be investigated. The sclera and cornea are more elastic in early childhood, and an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP), therefore, leads to an expansion of the globe and the development of buphthalmos (\"ox eye\").
