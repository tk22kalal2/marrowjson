      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Wide, variable splitting of S2 is a feature of VSD and not reverse splitting.The basic defect in VSD is a left-to-right shunt which occurs at the ventricular level. Duringsystole, the left ventricle empties into the aorta and the right ventricle via the VSD, because ofwhich the total amount of blood in the right side of the heart increases, and that on the leftdecreases. Due to this increase, the right ventricle takes a longer time to empty causing a delayedP2 and on the other hand, the left ventricle empties sooner causing an early A2. This explains thewide S2. Variations due to respiration still happen and hence, the second heart sound is widelyand variably split.Auscultatory findings of VSD include a pansystolic murmur also known as Roger's murmur/shuntmurmur can be best heard in the fourth left intercostal space. Flow murmurs that can be heardinclude, an MDM at the mitral area and an ejection systolic murmur at the pulmonary area.A hyperdynamic precordium, a palpable P2, parasternal heave, a laterally displaced apicalimpulse, and a systolic thrill can be detected on palpation.",

A softejection systolic murmur best heard over the left upper sternal border is also commonly found.The soft ejection systolic murmur is a flow murmur heard due to increased blood flow through thenormal pulmonary valve. A delayed diastolic murmur can also be heard in the tricuspid area. Asthe right ventricle now receives more blood, the time required for its emptying is increasedresulting in prolonged P2.

      "question": "Detailed ExplanationsThe most common mode of inheritance of congenital heart disease is multifactorial.Multifactorial inheritance refers to traits that are caused by a combination of inherited,environmental, and stochastic factors.Solution to Question 2:Ventricular septal defect(VSD) is the most common congenital heart disease.466The prevalence of congenital heart disease is estimated at 6-8 per 1000 live births.The relative frequency of major CHD: VSD &gt; ASD = PDA &gt; CoA = ToFNOTE:Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic heart disease.Solution to Question 3:The classical triad of cataract, sensorineural deafness, and congenital heart disease pointtowards congenital rubella syndrome. Atrial septal defect (ASD) is not found in congenital rubellainfection.Prenatal exposure to rubella increases the risk of congenital heart defects like:• Patent ductus arteriosus (Most common)•Peripheral pulmonic stenosis.• Ventricular septal defect (VSD)• MyocarditisNonspecific signs of TORCH infections are hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, jaundice, andgrowth restriction.Solution to Question 4:Wide and variable S2 (Abnormal S2) is not included under Nada's major criteria.Features of congestive cardiac failure, a grade 3 pansystolic murmur with wide and variable S2,and an MDM at the mitral area suggest a diagnosis of large VSD in this baby.NADA's criteria for clinical diagnosis of congenital heart disease:The presence of 1 major or 2 minor criteria indicates congenital heart disease.Pansystolic murmurs are always pathological no matter their intensity.Short, soft systolic murmurs of intensity &lt;3 are often detected during febrile illnesses, afterwhich they disappear. Such murmurs are called innocent murmurs. Before labeling any murmuras innocent, it should be reassessed after an interval.Major criteriaSystolic murmur grade 3 ormoreAny diastolic murmurCyanosisCongestive cardiac failureMinor criteriaSystolic murmur < grade 3Abnormal second sound (S2)Abnormal ECGAbnormal chest X-ray findingS467Major criteriaMinor criteriaAbnormal BPSolution to Question 5:Membranous is the most common type of ventricular septal defect (VSD) to occur.VSD is the most common congenital cardiac malformation.Types of VSD include membranous (most common), muscular, inlet/atrioventricular canal defects,and supracristal defects.Swiss Cheese septum: a special type of muscular VSD with defects in the mid-portion or apicalregion of the ventricular septum.Restrictive VSD -A small VSD where the size of the lesion is usually &lt;5 mm. It is associated withnormal right ventricular pressure.Non-restrictive VSD -A large VSD where the size of the lesion is usually &gt;10 mm leading toequalization of pressures in the right and left ventricle.Solution to Question 6:Wide, variable splitting of S2 is a feature of VSD and not reverse splitting.The basic defect in VSD is a left-to-right shunt which occurs at the ventricular level. Duringsystole, the left ventricle empties into the aorta and the right ventricle via the VSD, because ofwhich the total amount of blood in the right side of the heart increases, and that on the leftdecreases. Due to this increase, the right ventricle takes a longer time to empty causing a delayedP2 and on the other hand, the left ventricle empties sooner causing an early A2. This explains thewide S2. Variations due to respiration still happen and hence, the second heart sound is widelyand variably split.Auscultatory findings of VSD include a pansystolic murmur also known as Roger's murmur/shuntmurmur can be best heard in the fourth left intercostal space. Flow murmurs that can be heardinclude, an MDM at the mitral area and an ejection systolic murmur at the pulmonary area.A hyperdynamic precordium, a palpable P2, parasternal heave, a laterally displaced apicalimpulse, and a systolic thrill can be detected on palpation.Solution to Question 7:The above findings are suggestive of a large VSD with congestive cardiac failure. On a chest X-Rayof such a patient pulmonary oligemia is not seen.\"Suck-rest-suck cycle \", failure to thrive, high respiratory rate are features suggestive of congestivecardiac failure. Acyanosis, hyperdynamic precordium, palpable P2,pansystolic murmur, and468MDM in the mitral area suggest a large VSD.In ventricular septal defect (VSD), there is left to right shunting of blood, and this large volume ofshunted blood passes through the lungs, which is recognized in the chest X-ray as pulmonaryplethora (increased pulmonary vasculature). Other findings seen on a chest X-ray includecardiomegaly with left ventricular apex.If the defect is large, frank pleural effusion can be seen.RJMLSignificant cardiomegaly, prominence of the pulmonary arterial trunk, pulmonary plethora(increased vascular markings seen in the lung fields) can be seen on the X-ray image.Solution to Question 8:In patients with small VSDs, parents should be reassured of the relatively benign nature of thelesion, and the child should be encouraged to live a normal life, with no restrictions on physicalactivity. Surgical repair is not recommended.Guidelines from the Council on Cardiovascular Disease in the Young of the American HeartAssociation (AH",

        "A": "state that an isolated, small, hemodynamically insignificant VSD is not anindication for surgery. VSDs may get smaller or close completely without treatment, but theywon't get any bigger.Echocardiography is used to estimate pulmonary artery pressure, screen for the development ofLeft ventricular outflow tract pathology (subaortic membrane or aortic regurgitation), and confirmspontaneous closure.Solution to Question 9:Severe pulmonary vascular disease unresponsive to pulmonary vasodilators is a contraindicationto the closure of a VSD - due to permanent remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature.469Indications for surgical closure of a VSD include:• Patients at any age with large defects in whom clinical symptoms and failure to thrive cannot becontrolled medically;• Infants between 6 and 12 mo of age with moderate to large defects associated with pulmonaryhypertension, even if the symptoms are controlled by medication; and patients older than 24 mowith a Qp: Qs ratio greater than 2: 1.• Patients with a supracristal VSD of any size are usually referred for surgery because of theirhigher risk for developing aortic valve regurgitationA child with large VSD showing transient improvement in symptoms with better exercisetolerance may be the first sign of developing pulmonary hypertension and indicates an urgentneed for evaluation and immediate surgery - the increased pulmonary pressure reduces theamount of blood pushed into the lungs and thereby, congestion transiently.The presence of a mid-diastolic, low-pitched rumble at the apex is caused by increased blood flowacross the mitral valve and usually indicates a Qp: Qs ratio ≥of 2: 1. This murmur is bestappreciated with the bell of the stethoscope.Surgical risks are somewhat higher for defects in the muscular septum, particularly apical defectsand multiple (Swiss cheese-type) VSDs. These patients may require pulmonary arterial banding ifsymptomatic, with subsequent de-banding and repair of multiple VSDs at an older age.Solution to Question 10:The above findings are suggestive of a diagnosis of infective endocarditis according to ModifiedDuke's criteria. Patients with high-velocity blood flow lesions such as ventricular septal defect(VSD) and aortic stenosis are at high risk for infective endocarditis.To make a diagnosis of IE, she has evidence of endocardial involvement (1 major) and fever,predisposing heart condition, Janeway lesions(a painless small erythematous lesion on palms)- 3minor criteria.In VSD, a high-pressure gradient across the defect → turbulent blood flow → traumatizes thevascular endothelium → predisposition for infective endocarditis. Important complications ofVSD include infective endocarditis and Eisenmengerisation,High-risk cardiac lesions for which endocarditis prophylaxis is advised before dental proceduresand invasive procedures like tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy are prosthetic heart valves, priorendocarditis, post-cardiac transplant, congenital heart disease(6 months post repair andunrepaired).Solution to Question 11:The X-ray of the upper limb shows radial ray defects (absent radius and thum",
        "B": "and the familyhistory of heart disease suggest a diagnosis of Holt-Oram syndrome (aka hand-heart syndrome).Out of all the syndromes associated with cardiac defects, HOLT-ORAM has the strongest familialtendency it is inherited in an Autosomal dominant manner.470Holt-Oram syndrome/cardiac limb syndrome is most commonly associated with atrial septaldefect (ASD).Features of Holt-Oram syndrome include:• Hypoplastic or absent thumbs, radii• Triphalangism• Phocomelia• 1st-degree heart block• ASDSolution to Question 12:The given clinical findings and the karyotyping suggest a diagnosis of Trisomy 21 or Downsyndrome. The most common cardiovascular lesion in Down's syndrome is an endocardialcushion defect.Other associated defects are atrial septum defects (ASD), ventricular septum defect (VSD), andpatent ductus arteriosus (PDA), aberrant subclavian artery, and pulmonary hypertension.Other congenital defects are seen in some syndromes:SyndromeTrisomy 21 (Down syndrome)XO (Turner syndrome)William's syndromeCongenital defectEndocardial cushion defect,VSD, ASDBicuspid aortic valve, coarctation of aortaSupravalvular aortic stenosis,peripheral pulmonic stenosisPulmonic stenosis, ASDNoonan syndromeHolt-Oram syndromeMarfan's SyndromeASD, 1st-degree heart blockMitral or Aortic RegurgitationSolution to Question 13:Ostium secundum ASD (labelled as 3) is the most common type of atrial septal defect (ASD),located at the mid-inter-atrial septum, in the region of the fossa ovalis.471Superiorvena cavaTypes of Atrial Septal DefectsSinus venosusASD (SVC-type)Sinus venosusASD (IVC type)Coronarysinus ASDInferiorvena cavaBased on locationOMARROWForamenovaleOstiumPrimum ASDOstiumSecundum ASDASD is characterized by an abnormal opening in the atrial septum allowing communicationbetween the right and left atria. There are four types based on their location within the septum:• Secundum ASD - most common, usually an isolated abnormality• Primum ASD - associated with abnormal mitral valve leaflet (partial AV septal defect)• Sinus venous - is located at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium. Associatedwith anomalous right pulmonary venous return to the SVC or RA•Coronary sinus type ASD - also called unroofed coronary sinusOstium primum ASD: is located at lower atrial septumEndocardial cushion defect/An AV septal defect/ AV canal defect consists of contiguous atrial andVSDs with markedly abnormal AV valves. The lesion is common in children with Down syndrome.Congenital conditions associated with ASD include:Down's syndrome - usually an ostium primum defect• Holt-Oram syndrome - autosomal dominant disorder with upper limb bony defects and cardiacseptal defects, commonly secundum ASD• Ellis-van Creveld syndrome - chondroectodermal dysplasia associated with postaxial polydactylyand ASD⚫ Lutembacher syndrome - combined ASD and mitral stenosis due to rheumatic valvulitis•• Mitral valve prolapseSolution to Question 14:Theage of the patient, normal physical findings except for a systolic murmur, and wide and fixedsplitting of S2 are all in favor of a diagnosis of Atrial septal defect.472Most ASDs are asymptomatic and are picked up during routine physical examinations. A softejection systolic murmur best heard over the left upper sternal border is also commonly found.The soft ejection systolic murmur is a flow murmur heard due to increased blood flow through thenormal pulmonary valve. A delayed diastolic murmur can also be heard in the tricuspid area. Asthe right ventricle now receives more blood, the time required for its emptying is increasedresulting in prolonged P2. Since the two atria are linked, inspiration does not produce any netpressure changes between them abolishing respiration-related changes in venous return hencecausing fixed S2.Causes of Wide and fixed splitting of S2 include,.•• Atrial septal defect• RBBB• TAPVCOther options:-TAPVC patients usually present with cyanosis and congestive cardiac failure around 4-10 weeksof age this is when the fetal pulmonary vasculature regresses and there is increased pulmonaryblood flow which results in early-onset cardiac failure. The physical findings are identical to ASD.VSD is an acyanotic heart disease and physical findings include a pansystolic murmur best heardin the left 4th parasternal area and a wide and variable split S2 which is usually masked by thepansystolic murmur.PS is an acyanotic heart disease and physical findings include an ejection systolic murmur and athrill in the left second interface and a wide and variable split S2 because of delayed closure of P2.Solution to Question 15:Wide splitting of the 2nd heart sound with left axis deviation (LAD) and left ventricularhypertrophy (LVH) points to the diagnosis of ostium primum atrial septal defect(ASD). Wide-fixed splitting of the 2nd heart sound is characteristic of ASD.In ostium primum ASD, the basic abnormality is the combination of left-to-right shunt across theatrial defect and mitral insufficiency due to mitral valve clefts. Mitral valvular insufficiencyincreases the volume load on the left ventricle (seen as LAD &amp; LVH on ECG). When mitralinsufficiency is severe enough to cause clinical symptoms like fatigue on exertion, the left atriumenlarges as a result of the regurgitant flow, and the left ventricle becomes hypertrophied anddilated.Solution to Question 16:In atrial septal defect (ASD), there is a left-to-right shunt, resulting in increased blood flowthrough the right side of the heart, which leads to enlargement of the right atrium and ventricleand dilation of the pulmonary artery, the left atrium may also be enlarged, but the left ventricleand aorta are normal in size.473Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA): There is shunting of blood from the aorta to the pulmonarytrunk, which goes into the lungs and then again to the LA and LV. If the ductus is large, leftventricular or biventricular hypertrophy is present.In ventricular septal defect (VSD), there is shunting of blood from the left ventricle to the rightventricle, but most of the blood is shunted directly to the inflow tract of the pulmonary trunk, so,there is no significant right ventricular hypertrophy. In VSD, the pulmonary artery left atrium,and left ventricle are enlarged.In Tricuspid atresia, there is right to left shunting of blood through an ASD as the tricuspid valveis dysfunctional due to which the entire systemic venous return enters the left side of the heartusing the foramen ovale or through an ASD, and hence, there is left ventricular hypertrophy.Solution to Question 17:An ASD defect of size &lt;5mm at 2 years of age does not need immediate transcatheter deviceclosure.Small ASDs (3 to &lt;6mm in diameter) may grow smaller or close spontaneously. They do notcause symptoms and usually only need observation.Transcatheter device or surgical closure is advised for:••All symptomatic patientsAsymptomatic patients with a Qp: Qs ratio of at least 2: 1• Those with RV enlargement.• ASD size &gt;8mmClosure (if indicated) is recommended before school entry. Repair is preferred during earlychildhood because surgical mortality and morbidity are significantly greater in adulthood.Solution to Question 18:Infective endocarditis is extremely rare in isolated atrial septal defect (ASD) and antibioticprophylaxis for isolated ASDs is not recommended.ASD is a low-pressure gradient defect whereas a high-pressure gradient across a defect is requiredto create a turbulent flow, which traumatizes the vascular endothelium, making the patientsusceptible to endocarditis.Patients with a small or moderate ASD are asymptomatic unless a complication occurs.Pulmonary hypertension, atrial dysrhythmias, tricuspid or mitral insufficiency, and heart failuremay initially appear during the increased volume load of pregnancy.Solution to Question 19:474A preterm baby with the classical continuous machinery murmur in the Gibson's area is in favorof patent ductus arteriosus as the diagnosis. Preterm babies with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)have wide pulse pressure, hyperdynamic precordium, and bounding peripheral pulses with acontinuous murmur.If the PDA is large, it can cause overloading of the left ventricle leading to cardiomegaly andcongestive heart failure. Retrograde aortic flow, decreased systemic blood flow, and moderatehypotension is common in premature infants with a PDA predisposing them to necrotizingenterocolitis.Solution to Question 20:Differential cyanosis can be seen in patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) when there is a reversal ofshunt.Differential cyanosis is manifested as cyanosis of only the lower extremities while upperextremities are unaffected. It is a result of reduced arterial oxygen saturation in the distal aortacompared to that in the aorta proximal to the left subclavian artery.•It is seen with:right-to-left shunting across a ductus arteriosus in the presence of coarctation or an interruptedaortic arch• patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with severe pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH)The rest of the options cause cyanosis of all extremities.
