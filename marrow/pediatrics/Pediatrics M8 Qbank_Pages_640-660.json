Burkitt's lymphoma is the most common type of Non-Hodgkin lymphomaworldwide. St Jude system of staging is used for staging childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma.The current revised staging system used for NHL is the International Pediatric Non-HodgkinLymphoma Staging System (IPNHLSS) which reflects our increasing ability to diagnose lowerlevels of organ involvement with disease. For instance, the older staging system (St. Jude/Murphyclassification) did not account for molecular or flow cytometry involvement of bone marrow,which is now reflected in the new system.DiseaseHodgkin lymphomaNon-Hodgkin LymphomaChronic lymphoid leukemiaSystem of stagingAnn Arbor stagingSt Jude(Murphy) stagingRai stagingBinet staging",
