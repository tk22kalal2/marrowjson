      "explanation": "Given clinical scenario is suggestive of Addison's disease and hypertension is not seen here.Addison's disease is a primary adrenal insufficiency due to acquired lesions of the adrenal cortex,which prevent the production of cortisol and, often, aldosterone. Hence, due to mineralocorticoiddeficiency, there will be hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypotension.The deficiency of cortisol stimulates the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).Increased ACTH leads to diffuse hyperpigmentation, including areas not exposed to the sun, suchas buccal mucosa and gums.Addison's disease is characterized by the following:• Hyponatremia•Hyperkalemia• Hypotension• Hypoglycemia• Increased ACTH levels• Metabolic acidosis•• HyperpigmentationACTH stimulation test (cosyntropin) - Low cortisol levels before and after administration of ACTHare suggestive of primary adrenal insufficiency, Addison's disease.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "614The clinical scenario of hyperpigmentation, history of bilateral adrenalectomy and MRI showingenlarged pituitary adenoma points to the diagnosis of Nelson's syndrome.Nelson's syndrome is a rare complication of total bilateral adrenalectomy (TBA). TBA is aprocedure used to control hypercortisolism in Cushing's disease (due to ACTH-secreting pituitaryadenoma) when resection of the primary tumor is not possible.The loss of feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis following TBA increasesCRH. This leads to stimulation of ACTH-secreting corticotroph cells, causing enlargement of theoriginal pituitary tumor or formation of a new one.Nelson's syndrome is associated with a clinical triad of:Hyperpigmentation• Excessive ACTH secretion•Corticotroph adenomaScreening is done with fasting plasma ACTH levels and MRI brain performed at regularintervals. Prophylactic pituitary irradiation may be recommended to prevent its incidence. Theprimary treatment is transsphenoidal surgery. Patients will also require life-long glucocorticoidreplacement, as they do not produce cortisol.The use of steroidogenic inhibitors in the treatment of Cushing's disease has decreased the needfor bilateral adrenalectomy these days.Option B: Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome, also known as progressive supranuclear palsyis a neurodegenerative disease. It affects the brainstem and basal ganglia.Option C: Hamman-Rich syndrome also known as acute interstitial pneumonia, is a rare andsevere form of idiopathic interstitial lung disease.Option D: Job syndrome, also known as hyper-IgE syndrome is an autosomal dominantimmunodeficiency disorder. It occurs as a result of STAT3 mutation leading to deficiency in theIL-17 producing T cells. This results in impaired recruitment of neutrophils to sites of infection.",
