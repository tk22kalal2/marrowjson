However, loss of sodiumstimulates the secretion of aldosterone through the RAAS pathway.•••The aldosterone causes active reabsorption of sodium in exchange for K+ and H+ ions.• Loss of potassium ions leads to the development of hypokalemia.•Loss of H+ ions in urine lowers the urinary pH resulting in aciduria. It iscalled paradoxical aciduria, since the body initially lost H+ ions due to loss of HCl, and instead ofcompensating for that loss, the body is losing more H+ ions through urine.CHPS typically presents with the following:•• Non-bilious vomiting, which is progressive, maybe projectile, occurring immediately after a feed,usually presents after the 3rd week of age.• As the vomiting continues, a progressive loss of fluid, hydrogen ions, chloride ions, andpotassium leads to hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria.Hyperbilirubinemia is the most common clinical association of pyloric stenosis, which is alsoknown as the icteropyloric syndrome.",

The investigation of choice to confirm the diagnosis isultrasound.CHPS is associated with hypertrophy of the circular muscle of the pylorus resulting in constrictionand obstruction of the gastric outlet. It is common between 3-6 weeks of age. First-born maleinfants are at the highest risk.Infants usually present with projectile, non-bilious vomiting. Clinically, an olive-shaped mass ispalpable in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium. When the infant is given a test feed, visibleperistalsis is usually observed moving from left to right, followed by projectile vomiting.

The clinical vigentte suggesting straw -yellowfluid (suggestive of urine) along with secondary infection (mildly elevated temperature) andpresence of fluid only on straining are all suggestive of urahcal fistula.The urachus is an embryologic canal connecting the dome of the fetal bladder with the allantois, astructure that contributes to the formation of the umbilical cord. In this condition, there iscontinuous urinary drainage from the umbilicus on straining. It usually presents as a tender,swollen mass secondary to infection.Diagnosis is made by ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT).Definitive management is surgical resection of the tract.A patent vitellointestinal duct, patent omphalomesenteric duct and bladder diverticulum willcause umbilical discharge even in the absence of straining.

The tumourelaborates serotonin, 5-HT, and histamine, which produce flushing (frequent blushing), waterydiarrhoea, bronchoconstriction, and right heart failure.Carcinoid syndrome can cause secondary niacin deficiency as they consume and divert thetryptophan NAD+ pathway to cause the overproduction of serotonin. Thus, these patients can alsohave pellagra like features.The diagnosis can be confirmed by elevated levels of urinary 5-HIAA.366The image attached above demonstrates islands and nests of uniform cells with scant, pinkgranular cytoplasm and salt and pepper chromatin.Synaptophysin is typically positive in carcinoid tumors.Treatment: Essentially surgical.

It is more common in males. Risk factors includeDown's syndrome and RET oncogene.The imaging modality of choice in Hirschsprung's disease is a contrast radiographwith barium or gastrograffin enema (image shown above).The most important film is a lateral or oblique view of the rectum during slow filling. It typicallyshows a low bowel obstruction. The rectum is seen as a narrow tube and a cone-shaped transitionzone, seen proximal to the dilated ganglionated bowel.A rectal suction biopsy is a gold standard for the diagnosis and operative intervention is thedefinitive treatment.•Definitive surgeries for Hirschsprung disease are as follows:⚫ Swenson procedure, where aganglionic bowel is removed and a coloanal anastomosis isperformed.• Duhamel procedure, where the aganglionic rectal stump is left in place and the ganglionatednormal colon is pulled posterior.• Soave procedure: In this procedure, endorectal mucosal dissection is done within the aganglionicdistal rectum and then the ganglionated normal colon is pulled through the remnant muscularcuff, and a coloanal anastomosis is performed.NOTE:In the fetus, migration of the neuronal crest tissues to form myenteric plexus and ganglion cells iscompleted by the 24th week of life. If interrupted in migration, it results in Hirschsprung disease.",

      "explanation": "368The given clinical vignette is suggestive of imperforate anus in a neonate with VACTERLassociation (presence of vertebral and renal anomalies in addition to the analatresia). Lymphedema is not a component of VACTERL syndrome.VACTERL association is a disorder that affects many-body systems. People diagnosedwith VACTERL association typically have at least three of the following characteristic features.Components of VACTERL association:• Vertebral• Anorectal• Cardiac• Tracheal• Esophageal• Renal•Radial•• Limb anomaliesAnorectal malformations:•• It occurs due to the post-allantoic gut with the proctodaeum.• Newborns classically present with inability to pass meconium within 48 hours, abdominaldistention, intestinal obstruction, improper anal dimple, and sometimes with complaints ofpassing meconium per urethra.Wingspread Classification:• Low - Below the level of the pelvic floor (puborectalis).• Intermediate - Occurs at the level of the puborectalis with or without fistula.•High Anorectal agenesis, rectal atresia.-Investigations:• Wangenstein's invertogram is done 6-12 hours after birth with a metal coin strapped to thepresumed site of the anus.

      "question": "You notice a 5-year-old boy walking very differently in an orphanage. On probing further theguardian informs that he has a history of frequently soiling his pants. On examination, youfind a mass protruding through his anus and a diagnosis of rectal prolapse is made. Which ofthe following would be the most likely cause for this presentation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Pertussis",
        "B": "Constipation",
        "C": "Cystic fibrosis",
        "D": "Trichuriasis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "In this case, the most likely cause of rectal prolapse would be Trichuriasis. It is common in poorrural communities with inadequate sanitary facilities and soil contaminated with human oranimal feces. The highest infection rate occurs among children between 5-15 years.369Clinical manifestations include chronic dysentery, anemia, poor growth, and developmentaldeficits. In heavy infections, adult worms can extend throughout the colon down to the rectum.Over time, inflammation of the rectum causes tenesmus leading to prolapse.Other options:Pertussis would present with cough, low-grade fever, and sneezing. Increased abdominal pressuredue to the persistent cough could cause a prolapse.Chronic constipation is unlikely as the child has a history of frequently soiling his pants,suggestive of dysentery.Cystic fibrosis would manifest much earlier in life with respiratory symptoms like recurrentpneumonia. These children have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, causing protein and fatmalabsorption. This leads to bulky, greasy stools and eventually a prolapse if untreated.370",
