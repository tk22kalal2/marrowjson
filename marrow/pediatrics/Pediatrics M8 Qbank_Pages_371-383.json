      "explanation": "The clinical vignette is suggestive of acquired lactose intolerance which is an example of osmoticdiarrhoea.Lactose is present in milk and dairy products. If it is not absorbed in the small intestine, it reachesthe colon, where it is fermented to short-chain organic acids. This releases hydrogen that can bedetected in the lactose breath test and also generates an osmotic overload.377The child with lactose intolerance generally has perianal excoriations. The condition is diagnosedby using stool examination which shows acidic stool positive for reducing substances. Treatmentis by diet control using a diet devoid of lactose. It can be congenital due to lactase deficiency oracquired after post-viral gastroenteritis. In secretory diarrhoea, the epithelial cells' ion transportprocesses are turned into a state of active secretion. The most common cause of acute-onsetsecretory diarrhoea is a bacterial infection of the gut.Chronic diarrhoea is, in many cases, the result of an intestinal infection that persists longer thanexpected.Dysentery/Shigellosis is a type of food poisoning caused by infection with the Shigella species. It isspread by means of faeco-oral transmission.",

      "explanation": "Isotonic dehydration with acidosis is the most common finding in children with severe viralenteritis.Viruses that cause human diarrhoea selectively infect and destroy the villus tip cells in the smallintestine.In the small intestine, the upper villus enterocytes are differentiated cells, which have absorptivefunctions, such as the transport of water and electrolytes. On the other hand, the cryptenterocytes are undifferentiated cells and are net secretors of water and electrolytes.379Selective viral infection of intestinal villus tip cells thus leads to decreased absorption of salt andwater (proportionate loss of water and salt-isotonic dehydration) and an imbalance in the ratioof intestinal fluid absorption to secretion.Metabolic acidosis may be a result of stool bicarbonate losses in children with diarrhoea. Thesecan also be seen due to secondary renal insufficiency or lactic acidosis as a sequelae to diarrhoea.",
