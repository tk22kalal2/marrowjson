Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in children of ages 6 to 59 months is defined by the WHO as any of the following: • Weight-for-length (or height) below -3 SD of the median WHO child growth standards. • Presence of bipedal edema. • Mid-upper arm circumference <11.5 cm. Once the child is diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition, the doctor must assess for severe edema (+++); low appetite (failed appetite test); medical complications (severe anemia, pneumonia, diarrhea, dehydration, cerebral palsy, tuberculosis, HIV, heart disease, etc.) and one or more danger signs as per IMNCI. If any of the complications are present, the child is diagnosed with complicated SAM and is managed inpatient in the facility. If the above-mentioned signs are absent, the child is diagnosed with uncomplicated SAM and supervised management at home is given.",

Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) tape is used in children between 6 to 60 months. It is measured between the acromion and olecranon process and is an age-independent parameter. Alternative methods for evaluating malnutrition: Bangle Test - It has an internal diameter of 4 cms. Normally, it should not cross the elbow. QUAC stick test - It is given by the formula - Mid-upper arm circumference/Height of child. Skinfold thickness: It is an age-independent parameter.

      "question": "A laborer's second child is brought to the OPD with a swollen belly and dull face. He has been fed rice water (rice milk) in his diet mostly. On investigations, the child is found to have low serum protein and low albumin. What is the probable diagnosis?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of a child with a swollen belly, dull face with hypoproteinemia along with a poor diet history suggests the diagnosis of kwashiorkor. Kwashiorkor is a form of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) characterized by edema and apathy. In edematous malnutrition, the initial appearance of edema is commonly observed in the feet and lower legs, progressing into generalized edema affecting the hands, arms, and face. The skin over the swollen areas may show dark, crackled, peeling patches (flaky paint dermatosis) with pale skin underneath, making it susceptible to infections. There may be sparse and easily pluckable hair. Hepatomegaly with fatty infiltration is a common finding. Associated symptoms of misery, apathy, and loss of appetite are seen in children with edema. Other options: Option B: Marasmus is a severe form of wasting characterized by significant loss of fat and muscle tissue as the body utilizes these resources for energy. It is often triggered by acute starvation or illness in individuals with borderline nutritional status. Option C: Indian childhood cirrhosis (ICC) is a chronic liver disease that affects infants and young children. Common symptoms include jaundice, pruritus, lethargy, and hepatosplenomegaly. The disease progresses rapidly, leading to the development of cirrhosis. Option D: Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic inflammatory disorder with arteritis of medium to large-sized vessels. It presents with fever, rash, conjunctivitis, and cervical lymph node enlargement.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Children with marasmus have a voracious appetite, whereas children with kwashiorkor often refuse to eat. Marasmus is a calorie deficit state and kwashiorkor is a protein deficit state. The signs of low protein manifesting as hypoalbuminemia and edema are characteristically seen in kwashiorkor.",

Feeding should be initiated with starter F-75 (formula with 75 kcal/100 ml of feed)• Treat hypothermia (axillary &lt;35°C or 95°F): Skin-to-skin contact with care called \"kangarootechnique\" or dress in warmer clothes, cover head, wrap in a warmed blanket, and provideindirect heat.• Treat dehydration: Hydrate with ReSoMal (45 mmol Na/L). It is a low-sodium rehydrationsolution for malnutrition.128•Correct electrolyte imbalance: There is a deficit of potassium and magnesium and excesssodium. Give extra potassium (3 to 4 mEq/kg/day) and magnesium (4 mEq/ kg/day) for at least 2weeks.•• Treat an infection: Starting on the first day, give broad-spectrum antibiotics to all children.•Correct micronutrient deficiencies:• Do not give iron in the stabilization phase, because excess iron leads to free radical injury. Giveiron 3 mg/kg/day once the child starts gaining weight after the stabilization phase.•Give vitamin A on day 1. Repeat on day 2 and day 14.• Folic acid 1 mg (5 mg on day 1)• Zinc (2 mg/kg/day)•Copper (0.3 mg/kg/day)• Start cautious feeding: Give 8 to 12 small feeds of F75 feeds.

When accompanied by loose stools, management includes the use of low sodium ORS for rehydration of 5 mL/kg every 30 min for the first 2 hours. Management of fluid/electrolyte status in SAM: • Do not give IV fluids unless the child is in shock. • Give ReSoMal (low-sodium rehydration solution for malnutrition) 5 mL/kg every 30 min for the first 2 hr orally or NG tube. • Then give 5-10 mL/kg in alternate hours for up to 10 hours. The amount depends on stool loss and eagerness to drink. Feed every other alternate hour. • Give ReSoMal after each watery stool as a prevention strategy. • Do not continue aggressive hydration even after dehydration resolves. • Treatment of hypoglycemia in malnutrition: If conscious: 10% glucose (50 mL) orally or 1 teaspoon sugar under the tongue, whichever is the quickest. • If unconscious: Immediately give sterile 10% glucose (5 mL/kg) by IV. Note: 50% glucose is never used in children as it is extremely viscous and concentrated. This could lead to injection site pain, severe thrombophlebitis, and irritation. Also, this can cause osmotic overload in a three-year-old.",
