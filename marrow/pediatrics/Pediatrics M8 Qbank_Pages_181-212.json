      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The above pedigree chart denotes an autosomal recessive pattern. In the above pedigree chart, both males and females are carriers (equally affected), which indicates an autosomal pattern. Parents are unaffected (both are carriers/heterozygotes), and there are no affected members in other generations. 25% of the children are normal, 50% are carriers, and only 25% are affected. This indicates a recessive pattern.",

      "question": "While volunteering at the blood donation camp, Ananya came across a case of a thalassemic infant who has an AB-positive blood group. Her father is B-positive and her mother is A-positive. In order to understand more about donor eligibility to explain the concerned parents, she wishes to understand the inheritance pattern of ABO blood grouping. Can you help her out by choosing the correct option?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The inheritance pattern of the ABO blood grouping system is codominance. Codominance: Gene expression and Mendelian traits are usually described as dominant or recessive; in some cases, both of the alleles of a gene pair contribute to the phenotype - a condition called codominance. Examples include histocompatibility and ABO blood group antigens. Classification of genetic disorders: Mendelian disorders (Classic inheritance) • Autosomal dominant • Autosomal recessive • X-linked dominant • X-linked recessive. Non-Mendelian disorders (Non-classic inheritance) • Trinucleotide repeat mutations: Fragile X syndrome, Friedreich ataxia, Huntington's disease • Mutations in mitochondrial genes: MELAS, MERRF • Genomic imprinting: Angelman syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, Silver-Russell syndrome • Gonadal mosaicism. Chromosomal disorders: • Microdeletions: Cri du chat syndrome • Down's syndrome, Turner's syndrome, Klinefelter's syndrome.",

      "question": "An MBBS student, after attending a class on genetic disorders, noticed that a particular disorder appears in three consecutive generations of his family without any sex predilection. While drawing his pedigree chart, it also struck him that phenotypically normal family members were having healthy offspring. Based on this information, he concluded the pattern of inheritance of this disorder. What is the correct pattern?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The pattern of inheritance in this genetic disorder is autosomal dominant. Points in favour: • Autosomal dominant disorders have a vertical mode of transmission (individuals of two generations are affected - parent and children affected). • It appears in three consecutive generations of a family without any sex predilection. • An affected individual has a 50% chance of passing on the deleterious gene in each pregnancy. • Males and females are equally affected. Unaffected individuals do not pass on the disorder to their children. Autosomal dominant: Affected father, Unaffected mother, Affected son, Unaffected daughter.",

Autosomal dominant (AD) disorders are manifested in the heterozygous state. If both of the parents are affected, the chances of having an affected baby are 50% (since 50% will be 'Aa' and 25% will be 'AA', but 'AA' is usually fatal in the first few months of life, and 25% will be 'aa'). Note: Here, we consider both parents as 'Aa' (heterozygous) because 'AA' (homozygous) is usually fatal in the first few months of life. The odds of having an affected baby do not change with subsequent pregnancies. Inheritance pattern of Achondroplasia: Ova - Affected female - Dd, Unaffected offspring - Affected with achondroplasia, Affected male - Dd, Sperms - DD - Severely affected with achondroplasia (do not survive pregnancy).

      "explanation": "Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) or Louis-Bar syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder.205The defect in AT is in the ATM gene localized to chromosome 11q22-23. The ATM gene is involvedin the repair of double-strand DNA breaks. This defect in DNA repair leads to combinedimmunodeficiency (impaired immunoglobin isotype switching and association with thymichypoplasia) and predisposition to an increased risk of lymphoreticular tumors such as lymphomaor leukemia.AT is characterized by progressive ataxia (beginning during infancy), telangiectasia (initially onbulbar conjunctiva), sinopulmonary infections, hypogonadism, sensitivity to ionizing radiation,insulin resistance, and raised alpha-fetoprotein levels.",
