      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Thumb sign on lateral x-ray of neck is pathognomonic for acute epiglottitis (AE). It is seen due toepiglottic enlargement.AE is an inflammation of the epiglottis. The arytenoids, false cords, and posterior tongue may alsobe involved.In children, Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) is the most common cause. This has decreaseddramatically since the widespread availability of immunization (pentavalent). Streptococcuspyogenes, S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus have also been implicated. Non-infectious causes can beforeign body ingestion and trauma from thermal or caustic agents.It has a progressive and potentially fulminating course, characterised by high fever, sore throat,dyspnea, and rapidly progressing respiratory obstruction.AE is a clinical diagnosis and a true emergency, X-ray soft tissue neck is not necessary to confirmit. It may be used to rule out differentials such as laryngotracheobronchitis, foreign bodyobstruction, retropharyngeal abscess or congenital anomalies. The time taken for X-rays should beavoided in a critically ill child due to the risk of sudden complete airway obstruction.The definitive diagnosis of AE is made during direct laryngoscopy. However, since manipulationcan induce a laryngospasm, it is generally avoided.The image below shows thumb sign:",

But, since the widespread use of the H. influenzae type b vaccine, invasivedisease caused by H. influenzae type b in pediatric patients has been reduced by 99%.Therefore, other organisms, such as Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS), Streptococcus penumoniae,non-typeable H. influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus, have become the common causes of acuteepiglottitis in pediatric age group, overall in the world.Lateral X-ray of the neck shows the thumb sign in acute epiglottitis.",

      "explanation": "The history of progressive torticollis, neck pain and dysphagia in a young child along with a neckX-ray demonstrating a prevertebral soft-tissue swelling are all indicative of a retropharyngealabscess. In young children, an antecedent upper respiratory tract infection is the most commoncause of an RP abscess and not trauma.It involves the suppuration of lymph nodes present in the RP space and is more common inchildren younger than 3-4 years since these lymph node chains involute after 5 years of age. Boysare affected more often than girls. In older children and adults, the cause is usually trauma to theposterior pharynx, which leads to inoculation of the retropharyngeal space.Risk factors include poor oral hygiene, diabetes, an immunocompromised state, and lowsocioeconomic status.Clinical manifestations are nonspecific and include fever, decreased oral intake, and drooling.Neck stiffness and torticollis may also be present. As the abscess grows in size, it can also lead toupper airway obstruction and asphyxiation. The physical examination can reveal unilateral437bulging of the posterior pharyngeal wall.Although lateral radiograph is used for initial imaging, CT of the neck with intravenous contrast isthe best imaging study to evaluate patients with a retropharyngeal abscess.

It occurs due to ultrastructural defects in the dynein arm of cilia. Thiscauses the retention of secretions due to a failed mucociliary clearance mechanism. Clinically, thismanifests as chronic sinusitis and recurrent infections that ultimately lead to bronchiectasis.As ciliary function is necessary to ensure proper rotation of the developing organs in the chest andabdomen. Its absence, will lead to situs inversus or a partial lateralizing abnormality.Male patients with this condition tend to be infertile, due to asthenospermia (immotilespermatozoa due to impaired sperm flagella function).",
