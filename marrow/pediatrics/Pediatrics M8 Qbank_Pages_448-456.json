      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Oxygenated blood is carried to the fetus by the umbilical vein.The umbilical venous blood shunts via the ductus venosus into the inferior vena cava. Thus, theinferior vena cava, which also carries blood from hepatic veins, kidneys, and from lowerextremities carries a mixture of deoxygenated and oxygenated blood. So, the highest percentage ofoxygen in the fetal circulation is in the umbilical vein, followed by the inferior vena cava.The umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood from the fetus to the placenta for oxygenation.Note:In the umbilical cord, there are a pair of umbilical arteries and a single umbilical vein.Mnemonic: AVA- artery -vein- artery(2 arteries and a single vein).",

        "D": "Blood in inferior venacava has lower oxygen concentration compared to superior venacava"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Blood in the inferior vena cava has a higher oxygen concentration compared to the superior venacava.451The superior vena cava carries the deoxygenated blood from the upper part of the body to theright atrium. The highly oxygenated blood is carried to the fetus from the placenta viathe umbilical vein with 50% of the umbilical venous blood entering the hepatic circulation and therest bypassing the liver and joining the inferior vena cava (IVC) via the ductus venosus. Hence, theblood in the inferior vena cava has a higher oxygen concentration compared to the superior venacava. Also, relatively a larger percentage of oxygen-rich blood is perfused to the brain.Pressures in both the right and left ventricles are equal in a developing fetus. The upper part ofthe body is perfused exclusively by the left ventricle while the lower extremities are perfused bythe right ventricle.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The total fetal cardiac output at term is approximately 450 mL/kg/min.Approximately 65% of descending aortic blood flow returns to the placenta, and hence, only theremaining 35% perfuses the fetal organs and tissues.The clinical relevance of this 65% blood flow being directed to the placenta comes in the contextof delayed cord clamping vs early cord clamping after delivery. Delayed cord clamping entails theumbilical cord is clamped more than one minute after the birth or when cord pulsation hasceased. This delayed clamping allows the blood flow between the placenta and neonate tocontinue and helps improve the iron status in the infant.",

Hence, patent ductus arteriosus(PDA) is more common in premature infants.The fetal circulatory adjustments after birth are given below:The patency of ductus arteriosus may either provide an alternative route for blood to bypasscongenital defects such as pulmonary atresia or coarctation of the aorta.Therapeutic medications can be used to either maintain the patency (prostaglandin E1) orpromote closure (indomethacin).

      "explanation": "Alprostadil, a prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) analogue, can be used to keep the ductus open medically inthe coarctation of the aorta.The ductus arteriosus (the fetal connection between the pulmonary artery and the descendingaorta) is functionally closed at 10-15hrs after birth and anatomically closed at 10-21 days afterbirth.Survival of newborns with certain heart lesions such as coarctation of the aorta, hypoplastic leftheart syndrome and transposition of great vessels depends on the patency of ductus arteriosus.Closure of PDA in such conditions can lead to hypoperfusion, severe hypoxia and cyanosis.PGE1 is a potent and specific relaxant of ductal smooth muscle. PGE1 analogues like alprostadil,misoprost and rioprostil can be used to keep the ductus open and support systemic blood supply.In patent ductus arteriosus, the ductus is closed medically by NSAIDS (which inhibitprostaglandin synthesis) like ibuprofen trometamol/ ibuprofen lysine and indomethacin.Morphine can be used to manage respiratory distress but rarely preferred in a neonate.",
