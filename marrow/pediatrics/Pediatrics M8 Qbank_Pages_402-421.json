      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "412The lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio (L/S ratio) is an amniotic fluid test used to assess fetal lungmaturity. L/S ratio of &lt; 2 in amniotic fluid indicates lung immaturity.Surfactant starts appearing in the fetal lung by 20 weeks of gestation. Levels indicating lungmaturity are detected after 35 weeks.Surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates produced by type IIpneumocytes in the lung epithelium. The absence of surfactant in the liquid film lining the alveolicauses an increase in surface tension and alveolar collapse. If not treated, such atelectasis leads toincreased work of breathing, intrapulmonary shunting, ventilation-perfusion mismatch, hypoxia,and eventually respiratory failure.The relative concentration of the phospholipids lecithin (L) and sphingomyelin (S) is an indicatorof lung maturity. The outward flow of pulmonary secretions from the fetal lungs into the amnioticfluid maintains the level of lecithin and sphingomyelin equally until 32–33 weeks gestation whenthe lecithin concentration begins to increase significantly while sphingomyelin remains nearly thesame. An L-S ratio of 2.5 or more indicates fetal lung maturity while an L/S ratio of less than 1.5 isassociated with a high risk of infant respiratory distress syndrome.Other tests done to assess fetal lung maturity are:• Shake test/bubble test•Phosphatidyl glycerol measurement• Surfactant:albumin ratio•• Lamellar body counts",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Nile blue test showing &gt;50% orange cells is a sign of fetal lung maturity, not blue cells.Tests for the assessment of fetal lung maturity include:The Nile blue test involves staining desquamated fetal cells from amniotic fluid with 0.1% Nileblue sulfate. The presence of orange cells &gt; 50% suggests lungmaturity. Lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio at 31 to 32 weeks is 1, and at 35 weeks ratio is 2. Theratio ≥2 indicates lung maturity (option A).The shake test or bubble test (Clement's test) (option B) involves mixing amniotic fluid with 95%ethanol, shaking it for 15 seconds, and observing it for 15 minutes. A complete ring of bubbles atthe meniscus is a positive test and indicates lung maturity. This is a useful bedside test.The presence of phosphatidylglycerol, (option C) saturated phosphatidylcholine and lamellar bodycount (&gt;50,000/mcL) indicates lung maturity.Glucocorticoids accelerate lung maturation and lower the incidence of respiratory distress andneonatal mortality in preterms if the birth was delayed for at least 24 hours after initiation ofbetamethasone. A single course of corticosteroids is recommended for women between 24 and 36weeks who are at risk of delivery within 7 days. Intramuscular injections of either 2 doses of 12 mgbetamethasone are given 24 hourly or 4 doses of 6 mg dexamethasone are given 12 hourly.413",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The history of respiratory distress in a premature baby (34 weeks) and a biopsy showing pink(hyaline) membranes in the alveoli is indicative of hyaline membrane disease (HMD). The hyalinemembranes are composed of layers of fibrin-rich edema fluid and necrotic cells of lining alveoli.Diffuse ischemic damage to the alveoli causes the transudation of proteins into the alveoli to formthe hyaline membrane.Hyaline membrane disease (HMD), also known as infantile respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS)or respiratory distress syndrome of newborns (RDS) is a syndrome in premature infants caused bydevelopmental insufficiency of pulmonary surfactant production and structural immaturity of thelungs.",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The most common cause of respiratory distress in a preterm infant is neonatal RDS (hyalinemembrane disease). The infant has presented with moderate respiratory distress without anysigns of respiratory failure so early continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the appropriatetreatment.CPAP started at birth is the choice for the management of a preterm infant at risk for respiratorydistress syndrome (RDS). Early nasal CPAP has shown to lower mortality and risk ofbronchopulmonary dysplasia. Room air is better than oxygen for the resuscitation of preterminfants, and 100% oxygen is also harmful, causing increased oxidative stress.The intubate-surfactant-extubate (INSURE) on CPAP technique is recommended for surfactantadministration when babies showed signs of RDS and needed more than 30% inspired oxygen tomaintain saturation in the normal range.",

      "explanation": "Respiratory distress in a post-term neonate with a history of greenish (meconium-stained)amniotic fluid during delivery is suggestive of meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). Theaspirated meconium can block the large and small airways, causing patchy atelectasis andemphysema. This produces a ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Severe overinflation can lead to airleak syndromes such as pneumothorax.Meconium consists of water, desquamated GIT cells, skin, lanugo hair, vernix, bile salts,pancreatic enzymes, lipids, and mucopolysaccharides. The bile salts and pancreatic enzymes cancause chemical pneumonitis. Meconium can also cause surfactant inactivation by displacing itfrom the alveolar surface and inhibiting its surface tension-lowering ability. Severe MAS isassociated with remodelling and thickening of the muscular walls, resulting in pulmonaryhypertension.Infants who develop MAS typically present in the first 12 hours after birth with varying degrees ofrespiratory distress. On inspection, many affected infants have 'barrel chests'; crackles (rales) andrhonchi often can be heard on auscultation. In severe cases, the entire lungs can be involvedresulting in a total \"whiteout\" of the lungs on the radiograph.Listeriosis is an infection that is acquired from the mother and is reported to be rarely associatedwith meconium-stained amniotic fluid.418Pathogenesis ofMeconium aspiration syndromeMeconium aspirationMechanicalobstructionChemicalinflammationSurfactantinactivationAir trappingUnevenventilationAtelectasisIntrapulmonaryshuntingAir leaksHypoxemiaacidosisPrimarypulmonaryhypertensionOMARROW",

      "explanation": "The organism most likely to cause the mentioned infections is Chlamydia trachomatis.Pneumonia caused by C. trachomatis can develop in 10-20% of infants born to women withactive, untreated chlamydial infection. Only approximately 25% of infants with nasopharyngealchlamydial infection develop pneumonia.C. trachomatis pneumonia of infancy has a very characteristic presentation. It usually occursbetween 1-3 months of age and is insidious, with a persistent cough, tachypnea, and absence offever. Auscultation reveals rales; wheezing is uncommon.The absence of fever and wheezing helps to distinguish C. trachomatis pneumonia fromrespiratory syncytial virus pneumonia.A distinctive laboratory finding is the presence of peripheral eosinophilia (&gt;400 cells/µL).The most consistent finding on chest radiograph is hyperinflation accompanied by minimalinterstitial or alveolar infiltrates.",

      "explanation": "Once the diagnosis of congenital diaphragmatic hernia is made or suspected, all patients areintubated. Also a nasogastric tube, connected to continuous suction, is placed in the stomach toreduce lung compression.Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a birth defect of the diaphragm. The most commontype of CDH is a Bochdalek hernia (postero-lateral diaphragmatic hernia); other types includeMorgagni hernia (anterior-parasternal), diaphragm eventration, and central tendon defects of thediaphragm. Malformation of the diaphragm allows the abdominal organs to push into the chestcavity, hindering proper lung formation and expansion.Immediate steps of management:Endotracheal intubation → Placement of a nasogastric tube Administration of fluids andinotropic agents → Administration of surfactant therapy to only preterm infants with findingssuggestive of respiratory distress syndrome. Other options:Option B: Bag and mask ventilation is to be avoided as they lead to gastric/abdominal distensionand compression of the lung.Option C: Both arterial and central venous lines are inserted; however, this is not the first line ofintervention.420Option D: To support respiratory failure, the first modality to be used is conventional ventilation,and if there is no improvement, then high-frequency ventilation is used.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical picture of neonatal respiratory distress, absent breath sounds in the left side ofthe chest, and an X-ray image showing bowel loops in the thoracic cavity is diagnostic ofcongenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Though less commonly documented, dextrocardia is seenin association with CDH.A diaphragmatic hernia is defined as a communication between the abdominal and thoraciccavities with or without abdominal contents in the thorax. It is mostly congenital, with a defectiveformation of the pleuroperitoneal membrane. Females are affected twice as often as males.Bochdalek hernia accounts for up to 90% of the hernias seen in the newborn period, with 80-90%occurring on the left side. So, the heart will be pushed to the right side (dextroposition).Predictors of a poor prognosis include an associated major anomaly, symptoms before completionof 24 hours since birth, severe pulmonary hypoplasia, herniation to the contralateral lung, and theneed for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).Nitric oxide is a selective pulmonary vasodilator. It reduces ductal shunting and pulmonarypressures, resulting in improved oxygenation.421",

Clinical features include tachypnea, chest retractions, expiratory grunting, and nasalflaring. The infant may or may not be cyanosed.410X-ray features of HMD include:• Air bronchogram sign•Diffuse ground-glass opacities•Obliteration of cardiac and diaphragmatic contours giving rise to 'white-out' lung (indicatessevere disease)ABChest radiograph (",

        "B": "shows more severe changes. There is obliteration of the cardiac anddiaphragmatic contours due to marked opacification, giving a complete 'white out' appearanceSolution to Question 2:Respiratory distress syndrome occurs primarily in premature infants. Its incidence is inverselyrelated to gestational age and birthweight. It occurs in 60-80% of infants delivered at &lt;28 wkof gestational age, in 15-30% of those delivered between 32 and 36 weeks of gestational age, andrarely in those delivered at &gt;37 wk of gestational age.Other risk factors include the following:• Maternal diabetes•Multiple births• Cesarean delivery• Asphyxia•History of previously affected siblings411Solution to Question 3:Air bronchogram on chest x-ray is suggestive of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome.Other chest x-ray findings in respiratory distress syndrome (RDS):• Fine reticulogranular pattern•Bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacitiesWhite-out lung (severe disease)Option A: Patchy coarse infiltrates are associated with meconium aspiration syndrome.Option C: Reduced fat under the skin resulting in an emaciated appearance as well as prominentcreases is a feature of post-term babies. Respiratory distress syndrome is more common amongpreterm babiesOption D: Onset of respiratory distress syndrome is within 6 hours of birth.Solution to Question 4:Surfactant is given prophylactically to all neonates &lt; 28 weeks, not 31 weeks. It is givenirrespective of the presence or absence of RDS. The route of administration is intratracheal.Surfactant is indicated in all infants with moderate to severe RDS. It is also given as a rescuetreatment when CPAP fails.Solution to Question 5:The woman is currently in preterm labour and the dose of antenatal betamethasone given foravoiding complications of prematurity is 12mg IM every 24 hours (total 2 doses).Dexamethasone is used, the dose is 6mg IM every 12 hours (total 4 doses).Corticosteroid administration is recommended for all women in preterm labour (&lt;34 weeks ofgestation).Antenatal steroid administration reduces the risk of the following: (RINN)•Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)Intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH)• Necrotizing enterocolitis (NE",
        "C": "• Neurodevelopmental delaySolution to Question 6:412The lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio (L/S ratio) is an amniotic fluid test used to assess fetal lungmaturity. L/S ratio of &lt; 2 in amniotic fluid indicates lung immaturity.Surfactant starts appearing in the fetal lung by 20 weeks of gestation. Levels indicating lungmaturity are detected after 35 weeks.Surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates produced by type IIpneumocytes in the lung epithelium. The absence of surfactant in the liquid film lining the alveolicauses an increase in surface tension and alveolar collapse. If not treated, such atelectasis leads toincreased work of breathing, intrapulmonary shunting, ventilation-perfusion mismatch, hypoxia,and eventually respiratory failure.The relative concentration of the phospholipids lecithin (L) and sphingomyelin (S) is an indicatorof lung maturity. The outward flow of pulmonary secretions from the fetal lungs into the amnioticfluid maintains the level of lecithin and sphingomyelin equally until 32–33 weeks gestation whenthe lecithin concentration begins to increase significantly while sphingomyelin remains nearly thesame. An L-S ratio of 2.5 or more indicates fetal lung maturity while an L/S ratio of less than 1.5 isassociated with a high risk of infant respiratory distress syndrome.Other tests done to assess fetal lung maturity are:• Shake test/bubble test•Phosphatidyl glycerol measurement• Surfactant:albumin ratio•• Lamellar body countsSolution to Question 7:Nile blue test showing &gt;50% orange cells is a sign of fetal lung maturity, not blue cells.Tests for the assessment of fetal lung maturity include:The Nile blue test involves staining desquamated fetal cells from amniotic fluid with 0.1% Nileblue sulfate. The presence of orange cells &gt; 50% suggests lungmaturity. Lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio at 31 to 32 weeks is 1, and at 35 weeks ratio is 2. Theratio ≥2 indicates lung maturity (option A).The shake test or bubble test (Clement's test) (option B) involves mixing amniotic fluid with 95%ethanol, shaking it for 15 seconds, and observing it for 15 minutes. A complete ring of bubbles atthe meniscus is a positive test and indicates lung maturity. This is a useful bedside test.The presence of phosphatidylglycerol, (option C) saturated phosphatidylcholine and lamellar bodycount (&gt;50,000/mcL) indicates lung maturity.Glucocorticoids accelerate lung maturation and lower the incidence of respiratory distress andneonatal mortality in preterms if the birth was delayed for at least 24 hours after initiation ofbetamethasone. A single course of corticosteroids is recommended for women between 24 and 36weeks who are at risk of delivery within 7 days. Intramuscular injections of either 2 doses of 12 mgbetamethasone are given 24 hourly or 4 doses of 6 mg dexamethasone are given 12 hourly.413Solution to Question 8:The history of respiratory distress in a premature baby (34 weeks) and a biopsy showing pink(hyaline) membranes in the alveoli is indicative of hyaline membrane disease (HM",
