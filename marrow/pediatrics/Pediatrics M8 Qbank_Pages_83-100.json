      "explanation": "The child is able to make a tower of 6 cubes and speaks in 2-3 word sentences, which indicates the child is of 2 years of age. Birth weight quadruples by the age of 2 years. Hence, the child's weight should be 3 kgs x 4 = 12 Kgs. Infants may lose up to 10% of their birth weight in the 1st week of life and regain it by their 2nd week.",

        "D": "A girl's height at 2 years is half of her adult height"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Head circumference should not be measured within 24 hours because the head is subjected to molding during delivery, which makes the measurements unreliable. The maximum circumference of the head from the occipital protuberance to the supraorbital ridges on the forehead is recorded using the cross-tape method. Head circumference increases by the following: 2 cm/month in the first 3 months, 1 cm/month in the next 3 months, and 0.5 cm/month in the next 6 months. Head circumference is more than chest circumference by 2.5 cm at birth. At birth: Head circumference > Chest circumference. At 9-12 months: Head circumference = Chest circumference. After 1 year: Head circumference < Chest circumference. Age - Head circumference: At birth - 33 to 35cm, 3 months - 40 cm, 6 months - 43 cm, 1 year - 46 cm, 2 years - 48 cm, 3 years - 49 cm, 4 years - 50 cm, 12 years - 52 cm (adult size).",

      "explanation": "Primary teeth in the upper jaw erupt earlier than their counterparts in the lower jaw, except for lower central incisors and second molars. No primary teeth until the age of 13 months is called delayed eruption. As seen in the image below, the first primary tooth to erupt is the lower (mandibular) central incisor, at 5-7 months. All primary teeth erupt by 1.5-2.5 years of age. The first secondary tooth to erupt is the first molar (maxillary or mandibular), at 6-7 years, followed by the lower central incisor. Causes of delayed eruption: • Idiopathic: Most common • Hypothyroidism, Hypoparathyroidism • Familial • Mechanical blockage of individual teeth",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The upper segment to lower segment (U/L) ratio in this child is 1. The U/L ratio is low for his age, which makes spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia the most likely among the given options. The lower segment is defined as the length from the symphysis pubis to the floor. The upper segment is measured by subtracting the lower segment from the height. The U/L ratio is 1.7 at birth, 1.3 at 3 years, 1 after 7 years, and 0.9 in adults. Pubic symphysis - upper segment, lower segment. High U/L ratio: Rickets, Achondroplasia, untreated congenital hypothyroidism. Low U/L ratio: Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, vertebral anomalies. Arm span: the length between the tips of the middle finger of the outstretched hands is the arm span. It is shorter than the length by 2.5 cm at birth; it equals height at 11 years and thereafter is slightly greater than height (usually <1 cm).",

The bone age of a child indicates his/her level of biological and structural maturity. Methods used for bone age estimation are Greulich-Pyle atlas (more common) and Tanner-Whitehouse method.

        "B": "Lymphoid growth follows a sigmoid-shaped pattern",

        "D": "Growth of a child is cephalocaudal and distal to proximal"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Growth of a child is cephalocaudal and distal to proximal. During fetal life, the growth of the head occurs before that of the neck, and arms grow before legs. The distal parts of the body, such as hands, increase in size before the upper arms. Growth rate of different tissues: Growth denotes a net increase in size/mass of tissues. Cephalocaudal head development denotes maturation of functions: neck, trunk, and upper limbs, then lower limbs. Distal to proximal: hands increase in size before upper arms. Proximal to distal: hand use is learned before the use of fingers. Percent of adult size: 200, 100. Neural, lymphoid, general, genital. 0: birth, 10 years, 20 years. Brain growth: at the age of 1 month, the head size is about 36% of the expected head size in adults. It doubles in the first year of life to 72% and becomes 83% of adult size at 2 years. Lymphoid growth: it is prominent in mid-childhood. It peaks at 4-8 years and regresses subsequently. Gonadal growth: it stays dormant during childhood and shows a rise with the onset of puberty. Somatic growth: general body growth shows an S-shaped curve. It is rapid during the fetal period and the first 3-4 years. It is steady in the following period, followed by a growth spurt during puberty. Later, it slows down considerably. Note: WHO defines the perinatal period from 22 weeks of gestation (or ≥500 g) up to 7 days after birth.",

        "D": "Behavior must be developmentally inappropriate in two or more settings"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Attention-deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) must begin before 12 years of age, according to DSM-5 criteria. It was 7 years as per the previous DSM-4 criteria. Treatment: Presynaptic dopaminergic agonists, commonly called psychostimulant medications, including methylphenidate, dexmethylphenidate, amphetamine, and various amphetamine and dextroamphetamine preparations are used. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): 1. A persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity present for at least 6 months, that interferes with functioning or development. 2. Several inattentive or hyperactive/impulsive symptoms were present before 12 years of age. 3. Several inattentive or hyperactive/impulsive symptoms are present in 2 or more settings (e.g., at school [or work] or at home) and is documented independently. 4. There is clear evidence of clinically significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning. 5. Symptoms do not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, or another psychotic disorder, and are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g., mood disorder, anxiety disorder, dissociative disorder, personality disorder, substance intoxication or withdrawal).",

      "explanation": "Thumbsucking in a child is a way of discharging tension. It is a self-limiting habit disorder,usually seen between 6 months to 2 years.Option A: Pica is persistent ingestion of non-nutritive substances for at least 1 month. It hampersthe development of the child and requires clinical attention. Children with pica are at an increasedrisk of lead poisoning, iron-deficiency anemia, and parasitic infections.Option B: Breath-holding spells: It is preceded by a provocative event such as anger. Crying stopsat full expiration. Child may have apnoea, cyanosis, pallor, hypotonia, or even loss ofconsciousness, and generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS). Subtypes include cyanotic, pallid, andmixed episodes. Seizures and cardiac causes should be ruled out. Parents should be reassuredthat breath-holding spells are self-limiting.Option D: Enuresis:• When the child has never been dry, it is called primary enuresis.• When the bedwetting starts after a minimum period of six months of dryness at night, it istermed as secondary enuresis.• Nocturnal enuresis is caused due to maturational delay. In a normal individual, antidiuretichormone (ADH) levels usually peak between 4 am and 8 am. This circadian rhythm is impaired innocturnal enuresis, leading to bedwetting.• Treatment - Behavioural therapy with positive reinforcement, bladder alarms, and desmopressinreserved for cases resistant to behavioural therapy.",

      "question": "A 7-year-old boy was found to have a height for age 2 standard deviations below the median. Furthermore, his bone age was found to be equal to chronological age. Which of the following is most likely?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Familial short stature",
        "B": "Constitutional delay",
        "C": "Undernutrition",
        "D": "Growth hormone deficiency"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Familial short stature is most likely as bone age is equal to chronological age. Bone age is more than chronological age in precocious puberty. Bone age is less than chronological age in all other causes of short stature, such as constitutional delay, undernutrition, genetic diseases, and endocrine causes.",
