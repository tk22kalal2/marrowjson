The incubationperiod is 1-3 days. Most cases are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms like watery diarrhea,vomiting, low-grade fever, and temporary lactose intolerance. This is presumably because of theprotection by maternal antibodies in breast milk. Diagnosis can be made by rapid antigendetection of rotavirus in stool specimensLactose intolerance is actually not very common in infants and typically only starts showing upafter age 3.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Breastfeeding is not a mode of transmission of hepatitis B from an infected mother to the baby.Mother-to-child transmission of HBV can occur via the following three routes:• Intrauterine transmission•Transmission during delivery (most frequent method)345• Postpartum transmissionPostpartum transmission: A proportion of babies may acquire the infection after birth due to closecontact with the mother. However, breastfeeding is not a risk factor for HBV infection.Transmission following amniocentesis has been described, but the risk appears low.Newborns born to seropositive Hepatitis B mothers are given Hep B immunoglobulin as well asHep B vaccination at birth.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare complication of measles. Hence, priorinfection with measles is most likely.SSPE occurs 3-8 years after a primary measles infection. It is the least common complication ofmeasles but is almost always fatal.The clinical manifestations occur in 4 stages:Stage I: Maybe missed due to mild symptoms like irritability and reduced attention span.Stage II: Hallmark is massive Myoclonus. Involuntary muscle movements and myoclonic jerksstart from one group of muscles but gives way to massive spams and jerks.Stage III: Involuntary movements disappear and are replaced by choreoathetosis, immobility,dystonia, and lead-pipe rigidity due to destruction of deeper parts of basal ganglia.Stage IV: Loss of critical centers that lead to coma and then death.•Diagnosis of SSPE is by:• Detection of measles antibody in CSF• Characteristic findings on EEG•Typical histological findings or/and isolation of virus or virus antigen from brain tissue obtainedby biopsy or after postmortem.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given image shows small red lesions with bluish-white spots in the center on the inner aspectsof the cheek opposite to the lower premolar, indicating the presence of Koplik spots. Theappearance of these spots, along with a rash appearing three days later, strongly suggests adiagnosis of measles.The measles virus is a single-stranded RNA virus. Measles infection has 4 phases: the incubationperiod, prodromal illness, exanthematous phase (characterized by the rash), and recovery phase.After an incubation period of 8-12 days, the prodromal phase of measles starts with mild fever andis followed by conjunctivitis, photophobia, coryza, cough, and increasing fever. Koplik spots,appearing 1-4 days prior to the rash, are a characteristic sign of measles.Symptoms gradually intensify over a period of 2-4 days until the first day of the rash. The rashtypically begins on the forehead (around the hairline), behind the ears, and on the upper neck as ared maculopapular eruption. It then spreads downward to the torso and extremities, oftenbecoming confluent on the face and upper trunk.Complications include acute otitis media (most common), pneumonia (the most common cause ofdeath), croup, bronchiolitis, reactivation of tuberculosis, diarrhea, appendicitis, febrile seizures,and encephalitis. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is a rare chronic complication of measles.Other options:Option B: Leukoplakia appears as a white patch in the oral cavity that cannot be wiped off.Option C: Scarlet fever is Group A Streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis and is characterized by adistinctive sandpaper rash. The rash appears as a diffuse, finely papular, erythematous eruptionthat turns the skin bright red and blanches on pressure. It starts around the neck and spreads tothe trunk and extremities.Option D: Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic inflammatory disorder with arteritis of medium tolarge-sized vessels. It presents with fever, rash (maculopapular, erythema multiforme urticarial, ormicropustular), conjunctivitis, and cervical lymph node enlargement.",
