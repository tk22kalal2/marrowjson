It is the secondhuman chromosome whose DNA has been fully deciphered by the Human Genome Project.Chromosomal disorders: These may involve autosomal or sex chromosomes.Note:• Most common trisomy leading to miscarriage/incompatibility with life: Trisomy 16.• F body: Y chromosome (quinacrine, a fluorescence dye, binds strongly to the Y chromosomeforming a bright fluorescent spot called an F body).Involving autosomesDown's syndrome (Trisomy 21) Edward syndrome (Trisomy18) Patau syndrome (Trisomy13) Cri du chat syndrome (5pdeletion)Involving sex chromosomesKlinefelter's syndrome (47, XXY)Turner syndrome (45, Xo)223Solution to Question 2:The chromosomal karyotype of 47, XX,+21 is suggestive of Down's syndrome which occurs due tonondisjunction in maternal meiosis. Non-disjunction points to the failure of the homologouschromosome to separate during the meiotic division.Down's syndrome:• Most common chromosomal disorder•• Incidence: 1/800 live births• Mechanism:•Trisomy 21 (meiotic maternal nondisjunction) (95%)• Robertsonian translocation: 4%• Mosaic pattern: 1%Note:• Robertsonian translocations: involve 2 acrocentric chromosomes (chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21,and 22) that fuse near the centromeric region, with a subsequent loss of the short arms.malefemalemiscarriagechromosome 13chromosome 21Robertsonian translocationder(13;21)(q10;q10)CarrierNormalDown syndromeCarrierDown syndrome NormalSolution to Question 3:Simian crease (single transverse palmar crease) is not seen in cystic fibrosis.Simian crease is seen in the following disorders:Down's syndrome•⚫ Fetal alcohol syndrome224•Trisomy 13• Cri du chat syndromeSolution to Question 4:The girl is suffering from Down's syndrome and the most common cardiovascular lesion isan endocardial cushion defect.Other associated defects are atrial septum defects (ASD), ventricular septum defect (VSD), patentductus arteriosus (PD",
