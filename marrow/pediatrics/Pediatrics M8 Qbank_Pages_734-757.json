Globin gene sequencing is used for its definitive diagnosis.747High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is used as a screening test for thalassemia(option A).Thalassemia is a hemoglobinopathy that arises due to deficient synthesis of the globin chains.Depending on the chain affected, it is classified into α-thalassemia and ẞ-thalassemia.ẞ-thalassemia is caused by point mutations of the ẞ-thalassemia gene on chromosome 11, whichdiminish the synthesis of ẞ-globin chains. Splicing mutations are the most common cause of (ẞ+)thalassemia.There is a deficit in the synthesis of HbA with an elevation of HbA2 and HbF levels inB-thalassemia. Children with severe thalassemia present with distinctive facial features such asmaxilla hyperplasia, a flat nasal bridge, and frontal bossing. Other manifestations includepathologic bone fractures, significant hepatosplenomegaly, and cachexia.Blood smears show marked anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, and microcytic hypochromic anemia.Target cells, basophilic stippling, and fragmented red cells also are common. A radiographicimage of the skull shows the classic 'crew cut' appearance.Hb Electrophoresis and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are used as screeningtests for thalassemia. DNA diagnosis to detect ẞ-thalassemia mutations is used for definitivediagnosis. The Mentzer index is the ratio of MCV to RBC count.

      "explanation": "The given clinical features along with the peripheral smear showing acanthocytes make thediagnosis of abetalipoproteinemia more likely.Abetalipoproteinemia is an autosomal recessive hemolytic disorder in which acanthocytosis isassociated with fat malabsorption, progressive ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa.Acanthocytes or spur cells are spiculated red cells with a few projections of varying size andsurface distribution. The most significant associations include abetalipoproteinemia and severeliver disease.Note: Do not confuse acanthocytes with echinocytes or burr cells. They appear with multiple smallprojections that are uniformly distributed on the red cell surface.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario along with the megaloblastic picture elevated homocysteine levels, andnormal methylmalonate levels are suggestive of folate deficiency anemia.Goat's milk is deficient in folate. So goat milk-fed infants are likely to develop folate deficiencyanemia. Human breast milk, infant formulas, and pasteurized cow's milk provide adequateamounts of folic acid.In folate deficiency anemia, lactate dehydrogenase levels in serum are elevated. Folate-deficientmothers do not give birth to infants with folate deficiency because there is a selective transfer offolate to the fetus via the placental folate receptors.Methylenetetrahydrofolate (MTHFR) deficiency is the most common inborn error of folatemetabolism, and severe cases can produce neurologic and vascular complications; there is noassociated megaloblastic anemia.Malnutrition is the most common cause of folate deficiency in children.Note: Both homocysteine and methylmalonate levels are elevated in B12 deficiency anemia.",

Acquired hypoproliferativeanemia, is the most common cause of anemia in children among the given options.Iron-deficiency anemia (which is classified as an acquired hypoproliferative anemia) is the mostcommon cause of anemia in children and adults worldwide. Iron deficiency is also the mostcommon nutrient deficiency worldwide.Solution to Question 3:Exposure to whole cow's milk protein can cause chronic intestinal blood loss in infants. Therefore,the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends delaying the introduction of cow's milk ininfancy and limiting it to &lt;700 mL/day.Both cow's milk and breast milk have the same iron content (≈0.1mg/dL).The bioavailability of breast milk iron is 2-3 times higher than cow's milk iron.Exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months of age and complementary feeding with iron-rich foodsthereafter reduces the risk of iron-deficiency anemia in infants.Solution to Question 4:Bone marrow erythroid hyperplasia is the earliest hematological response observed following irontherapy in iron-deficiency anemia.Responses to iron therapy in iron deficiency anemia:743Time after administration12 to 24 h36 to 48 hResponseSubjective improvements - decreased irritability, increasedappetiteBone marrow response- erythroid hyperplasia48 to 72 h (peaks at 5-7 days) Reticulocytosis4 to 30 days1 to 3 monthsIncrease in hemoglobin levelRepletion of stores (ferritin)Solution to Question 5:Poor compliance is the most likely cause of non-responsiveness to oral iron therapy.Differential diagnosis of microcytic anemia that fails to respond to oral iron:• Poor compliance (most common cause)• Incorrect dose or formulation•Malabsorption of administered iron•Ongoing blood loss, including gastrointestinal, menstrual, and pulmonaryConcurrent infection or inflammatory disorder• Concurrent vitamin B12 or folate deficiency• Diagnosis other than iron deficiency• Thalassemias• Hemoglobins C and E disorders•• Anemia of chronic disease• Lead poisoning• Sickle thalassemias, hemoglobin SC disease.• Iron refractory iron-deficiency anemia (IRIDA)Solution to Question 6:High-performance liquid chromatography (HPL",

It is diagnosed with the presence of a new radiodensity on chest radiography with any 2of the following:• Fever••• Respiratory distress⚫ Hypoxia• Cough⚫ Chest painIn this case, the child with sickle cell anemia satisfies the above criteria. He presented with chestpain and respiratory distress and his chest X-ray image shows new radiodensities.Most patients with ACS do not have a single identifiable cause. Infection is the most well-knownetiology, yet only 30% of ACS episodes will have positive sputum or bronchoalveolar culture. Themost common bacterial pathogens implicated are S. pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, andChlamydia spp.Oxygen should be supplemented to all patients who demonstrate hypoxia.Blood transfusion is the only method to abort a rapidly progressing episode of ACS.Because of the clinical overlap between pneumonia and ACS, all episodes should be treatedpromptly with antimicrobial therapy, including at least a macrolide and possibly athird-generation cephalosporin.Regular use of an incentive spirometer at 10-12 breaths every 2 hours can significantly reduce thefrequency of subsequent acute chest pain episodes.Solution to Question 8:Hydroxyurea is the drug of choice for reducing painful crises in sickle cell anemia.Hydroxyurea is a myelosuppressive agent that is effective in reducing the frequency of painfulepisodes like dactylitis and acute chest syndrome, decreasing the rate of hospitalization, andrequirement for blood transfusion.
