      "explanation": "Thyroid dysgenesis is the most common cause of permanent congenital hypothyroidism (80-85%of cases) &gt; dyshormonogenesis (15%).Dysgenesis may involve ectopy, agenesis (absence) or hypoplasia (underdevelopment) of thethyroid gland. Dyshormonogenesis results from a defect in any of the steps in thyroid hormonebiosynthesis.*TSH - thyroid-stimulating hormone; TRH - thyroid-releasing hormoneAcquired hypothyroidism can be caused by iodine deficiency, thyroiditis, radiation, histiocytosis,and drugs. The most common cause of acquired hypothyroidism is autoimmune thyroiditis(Hashimoto's).Note: Mutation in PAX-8 gene is associated with congenital hypothyroidism and genitourinaryabnormalities such as renal agenesis.586Etiology of congenital hypothyroidism:Primary hypothyroidism:Thyroid dysgenesisThyroid dyshormonogenesisIodine deficiency (endemic goiter) Defect inthyroid hormone transport-Mutation inMCT8(monocarboxylatetransporter 8) geneMaternal antibodies- thyrotropin receptor-blocking antibody(TRBAb)Maternal medications- iodides, amiodarone, propylthiouracil, methimazole, radioiodineCentral (hypopituitary) hypothyroidism:TSH deficiency-mutation in TSH ẞ-subunit geneTRH deficiency- mutation in TRH geneTRH unresponsiveness-mutation in TRH receptor geneMultiple congenitalpituitary hormone deficiencieS",

It is the mostcommon cause of syndromic deafness. The biochemical reason for hypothyroidism in patientswith Pendred syndrome is impaired iodide organification (resulting from a mutation in thePendrin gene).",

      "explanation": "Elevated TSH levels and low T4 levels in a 9-day-old infant are suggestive of congenitalhypothyroidism. Prolongation of physiologic hyperbilirubinemia is an early sign of congenitalhypothyroidism. It is due to delayed maturation of the hepatic glucuronide conjugation system.Hyperreflexia, hyperirritability and diarrhoea are seen in hyperthyroidism; not hypothyroidism.588Note:Kocher-Debré-Sémélaigne syndrome: The muscles are usually hypotonic in congenitalhypothyroidism. Rarely, hypothyroidism in infancy can be characterized by generalized muscularpseudohypertrophy, myxoedema, short stature and cretinism. Affected older children can have anathletic appearance.

Craniosynostosis is not seen in neonatalhypothyroidism. It is seen in hyperthyroidism.Craniosynostosis refers to the premature fusion of sutures and closure of fontanelles and oftenresults in abnormal, triangular facies. In congenital hypothyroidism, there is delayed closure ofthe fontanelles. Palpable goitre, though not common, can be seen in cases of untreated thyroiddyshormonogenesis.",

      "explanation": "Newborn screening can fail to detect the affected twin with hypothyroidism.Discordance for thyroid dysgenesis is the rule in monozygotic twins. The transfusion of euthyroidblood from the unaffected twin normalizes the serum levels of T4 and TSH in the affected twin,resulting in delayed or missed diagnoses. Therefore, a second sample for congenitalhypothyroidism screening at 14 days of age should be considered in monozygotic twins.Neonatal thyroid screening strategies:•Primarily TSH, backup T4; T4 is measured if TSH level is &gt;20 mU/L•Primarily T4, backup TSH: TSH is measured only if T4 level is low•Concomitant T4 and TSH; it is the most sensitive methodNote: the sample is obtained after 24-48 hours, to minimize the false elevation of TSH values dueto normal post-delivery neonatal TSH surge.",
