Results of complementstudy and ASO levels also support this diagnosis. Supportive conservative therapy is the best stepin the management of PSGN.Management of PSGN is directed at treating the acute effects of renal insufficiency (sodiumrestriction and prescribing diuretics - usually with intravenous furosemide) and hypertension.Although a 10-day course of systemic antibiotic therapy with penicillin is recommended to limitthe spread of the nephritogenic organisms, antibiotic therapy does not a ect the natural history ofacute PSGN.Note: Steroids and cyclosporine are not used in the management of PSGN.Solution to Question 9:The given features of oliguria, hematuria, pedal edema and hypertension are likely ofglomerulonephritis. The complication of hypertensive encephalopathy is seen in this case due tosymptoms of seizure, blurred vision and severe headache. Hyperkalemia and left ventricularfailure are also common complications of glomerulonephritis while bleeding diasthesis is not acomplication of glomerulonephritis.Acute complications of glomerulonephritis result from hypertension and acute renal dysfunction-• Hypertension is seen in 60% of patients and is sometimes associated with hypertensiveencephalopathy and intracranial bleeding.• Acute renal failure can occur, which may require treatment with dialysis.Other potential complications include the following:•Heart failure• Hyperkalemia•.Hyperphosphatemia• Hypocalcemia• Hyponatremia• Acidosis• Seizures• UremiaSolution to Question 10:Gross hematuria following a gastrointestinal infection, associated with normal C3 levels, in amale patient is suggestive of immunoglobulin A nephropathy (Berger nephropathy).•IgA nephropathy is the most common chronic glomerular disease in children.515• Focal and segmental mesangial proliferation and increased mesangial matrix are seen in theglomerulus.• It is characterized by a predominance of IgA within mesangial glomerular deposits in theabsence of systemic disease.•It is seen more often in males.• Gross hematuria occurs within 1-2 days of onset of an upper respiratory or gastrointestinalinfection (in contrast to the long latency period observed in acute post-streptococcalglomerulonephritis).•• It can be associated with loin pain.Normal serum levels of C3 in IgA nephropathy (help to distinguish this disorder from PSGN).• Serum IgA levels have no diagnostic value because they are elevated in only a few paediatricpatients.Solution to Question 11:The location of cellular injury in IgA nephropathy (Berger nephropathy) is the deposition of IgAantibodies in the mesangial cell.Mesangial cells are directly exposed to the circulation; therefore, they are affected in diseasescharacterized by the deposition of immune complexes.Mesangial cell diseases:• IgA nephropathy• IgM nephropathy•Mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis• Class II lupus nephritis• Diabetic nephropathyNote: In IgA nephropathy gross hematuria often occurs within 1-2 days of onset of an upperrespiratory or gastrointestinal infection. In contrast, a longer latency period of about 1-2 weeks isobserved in acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis.Solution to Question 12:Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis is categorized into 3 distinctforms:• Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; formerly Wegener granulomatosis)• Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA)⚫ Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, formerly called Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS)•516Kidney biopsies typically demonstrate crescentic glomerulonephritis with little or no immunecomplex deposition.ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) comprises a group of multi-systemic diseases affectingsmall-to-medium-sized vessels.

Anti-glomerular basementmembrane (anti-GBM) antibodies are diagnostic.\"Goodpasture syndrome\" is characterized by pulmonary haemorrhage and glomerulonephritisand \"Goodpasture disease\" is used for those patients with glomerulonephritis, pulmonaryhemorrhage, and anti-GBM antibodies. It is caused due to autoantibodies directed against type IVcollagen, which is present in the alveoli and glomerular basement membrane.

Recurrent episodes of grosshematuria may be seen 1-2 days after an upper respiratory infection.•• Bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (not conductive)Ocular abnormalities: anterior lenticonus, macular flecks, corneal erosions• Proteinuria: Progressive proteinuria, often exceeding 1 g/ 24 hrs, is common by the 2nd decadeof life.Solution to Question 16:A defect in type IV collagen, a major component of the basement membrane, is responsible forAlport syndrome.Alport syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous disease, 85% is X-linked and the rest may beautosomal recessive or autosomal dominant.Solution to Question 17:Sinding-Larsen-Johansson syndrome is an insertional periostitis at the inferior pole of the patella(not associated with Renal disease).Lowe syndromeDenys-Drash SyndromeAlport syndromeSinding-Larsen-Johansson syndromeOculocerebrorenal syndrome:Hypotonia, renal diseaseAssociated withWilm's tumor:Early-onset renal failure withrenal mesangial sclerosis, male pseudohermaphroditismBilateral sensorineuralhearing loss, renal diseasePeriostitisat the inferior poleof the patellaSolution to Question 18:Microalbuminuria is defined as a urinary albumin excretion rate of 30-300 mg/24 hrs.518Here, the presence of albumin in the urine is above the normal level but below the detectablerange for the urine-dipstick methods. It is commonly associated with glomerular hyperfiltrationand blood pressure elevation.In adults, persistent microalbuminuria indicates diabetic nephropathy and is also a predictor ofcardiovascular and renal disease.In children, microalbuminuria is associated with obesity and predicts the development of diabeticnephropathy in type 1 diabetes mellitus.Solution to Question 19:The currently accepted definitions of \"nephrotic range proteinuria\" include:••• Urine protein: creatinine ratio &gt; 2• Urine protein &gt; 40 mg/m2/hr• Urine protein 3+ or 4+ in dipstick testAs a consequence of the large urinary loss of protein, the patient develops hypoalbuminemia (&lt;2.5 g/dL) and gross edema.Solution to Question 20:Hematuria is not a usual feature of nephrotic syndrome. It is a feature of nephritic syndrome.However, occasionally it is seen in the FSGS variant of nephrotic syndrome as well.Classic features of nephrotic syndrome:• Nephrotic range proteinuria ( &gt;40mg/m2/hr urine protein: creatinine ratio &gt;2)• Hypoalbuminemia (&lt;2.5 g/dL)• Edema• Hyperlipidemia (cholesterol &gt; 200 mg/dL)• HypercoagulabilitySolution to Question 21:The commonest cause of nephrotic syndrome in children is minimal change disease. (85% ofcases).The glomeruli appear almost normal on microscopy, hence the name. Immunofluorescencemicroscopy are negative, and electron microscopy shows effacement of the epithelial cell footprocesses.Treatment: Steroids; 95% of patients respond.519Other options:• Membranous nephropathy is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in the elderly; it isa rare cause of nephrotic syndrome in children.•Alport syndrome or hereditary nephritis: All patients have asymptomatic hematuria; progressiveproteinuria is common only by the 2nd decade of life and can be severe enough to cause nephroticsyndrome. This nephrotic syndrome is not common in children.• IgA nephropathy presents more commonly as an acute nephritic syndrome or withasymptomatic hematuria. It presents with nephrotic syndrome quite rarely.Solution to Question 22:Nephrotic syndrome is concluded as the diagnosis here because of the symptoms of anasarca andproteinuria. A spot urine protein:creatinine ratio &gt;2, low serum albumin levels, andhyperlipidemia marked by high cholesterol and triglyceride levels, further add to this diagnosis.Minimal change disease is the commonest cause of nephrotic syndrome in children andconstitutes 85% of all paediatric cases. The etiology is due to the flattening of foot processes(podocytes) of epithelial cells (seen on electron microscopy). This finding is marked in the imagegiven below.Diffuse loss offoot processesu may have beenMicrovilliVacuolation• Here, the glomeruli appear normal or show a minimal increase in mesangial cells and matrix.••• It is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children.Epithelial cells, in conjunction with the basement membrane, allow the filtration of plasmasolutes but block the passage of cells and plasma proteins.
