      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "A tuft of hair over the lumbosacral region in a newborn is suggestive of occult spinal dysraphismor neural tube defect. It comprises a range of conditions, including spina bifida occulta, intradural551lipoma, and dorsal dermal sinus.Spinal dysraphism is due to the defective fusion of the midline embryonic neural, vertebral, andmesenchymal structures. Associated clinical features are high-arched feet, muscle size andstrength differences between legs, and abnormal walking patterns. In newborns and younginfants, the neurological examination is usually normal, but older children may experience a lackof sensation in the perineal area and back pain.Most of the patients will have a cutaneous abnormality overlying the lower spine, including asmall dimple, a tuft of hair, or a subcutaneous lipoma.The image shows a tuft of hair in a case of spinal dysraphism:Spinal dysraphism also includes meningocele, myelomeningocele, lipomeningocele,diastematomyelia (split spinal cord), thickened filum terminale, and cauda equina tumour.The initial investigation is usually ultrasound in the neonate and the best investigation is MRI.Spina bifida is the most common type of spinal dysraphism, in which the spinal column does notclose completely, leaving the spinal cord and its protective covering exposed.552Types of spina bifidaSpina bifida occulta (mildest form)The defects in the vertebrae are so small that the spinal cord does notprotrude. They are covered by skin or may have hair growing from them.MeningoceleThe meninges protrudethrough the defect in thevertebra.Myelomeningocele(meningomyelocele)The spinal cord, with the meningealcoverings, protrude through thedefect in the vertebra.Myelomeningocele is the most severe form of spina bifida, where the spinal cord and nerve rootsare exposed and may be damaged. A sac-like protrusion, containing spinal cord tissue, meninges,and cerebrospinal fluid, is visible outside the body, often leading to significant neurologicalimpairments and disabilities.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "In the given clinical scenario, the presence of abnormal sonographic markers, like the lemon andbanana sign, is highly suggestive of neural tube defects (NTDs). Acetylcholinesterase is used as abiochemical marker of neural tube defects during the screening tests.NTDs account for the largest proportion of congenital anomalies of the CNS. The failure of closureof neural tube allows excretion of fetal substances such as Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) andacetylcholinesterase into the amniotic fluid thereby serving as biochemical markers for NTDs.The lemon and banana sign, noted on antenatal imaging, are one of the many notable fruits'inspired signs. The banana sign refers to the shape of the cerebellum owing to caudaldisplacement while the lemon sign refers to the lemon-shaped head resulting from scalloping ofthe frontal bones. It is seen in fetuses with open neural tube defects.The image below shows the characteristic lemon sign on ultrasound-553The image below shows the characteristic banana sign on ultrasound-Note:Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPPA), inhibin A, and human chorionic gonadotrophin(hCG) are the biochemical markers of trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome).",

      "explanation": "Aqueductal stenosis is the most common cause of ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus innewborns.Ventriculomegaly is the dilation of the ventricles. When ventriculomegaly occurs in associationwith raised cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, it is called hydrocephalus.Pathologic etiologies can be congenital or acquired. Congenital causes include structuralabnormalities such as aqueductal stenosis, agenesis of the corpus callosum, Dandy-Walkermalformations, Chiari malformations, and neural tube defects. Acquired causes are intracranialinfections(cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis), intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic injury, and brainparenchymal tumors.Aqueductal stenosis is the narrowing or obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct, a narrow channelthat connects the third and fourth ventricles in the brain. As a result, the fluid accumulates withinthe ventricles, causing them to enlarge.Treatment for aqueductal stenosis includes ventriculostomy, diuretics, serial lumbar punctures inspecific cases, and CSF diversion. In severe cases, CSF diversion procedures (shunting), may benecessary to redirect the flow of CSF and relieve pressure on the brain.555MCirculation of CSFLateral VentriclenInterventricular Foramina(Foramina of Monro)Third VentricleCerebral Aqueduot(&queduct of Sylvius)Fourth VentricleForamina of LusohkaForamenpubof MagendieSubarachnoidLateral ventricleToramanof Monno)Dura maiorCentral canal ofChorold PlexCBF ProcanmeCentral Canal of SpinalGordthe lateral ventricleOMARROW",

This recommendation applies within 24 hours before or after theinitiation of antibiotic therapy in the index case.For the treatment of cases, penicillin is the preferred drug, but ceftriaxone or otherthird-generation cephalosporins are recommended for patients with penicillin allergy.

      "explanation": "Isolation of the child is recommended until 24 hrs after the initiation of effective therapy afterbeing diagnosed with acute bacterial meningitis to prevent further transmission.Droplet precautions are recommended for patients with Neisseria meningitides and Haemophilusinfluenzae type b (Hib) meningitis until they have received 24 hours of effective therapy. Patientsshould be in private rooms, and hospital personnel should wear a face mask when they are within3 feet (1 meter) of the patient.The child with meningitis shows nonspecific symptoms like fever, anorexia, poor feeding,headache, myalgia, hypotension, petechia, purpura, or a rash. Meningial irritation is indicatedby nuchal rigidity, back pain, and Kernig, and Brudzinski signs (usually not seen in infants).Seizures and altered mental status may be present.The recommended empirical antibiotic regimen in a suspected case of meningitis outside theneonatal period is vancomycin combined with a third-generation cephalosporin. Patients allergicto penicillin or cephalosporin can be treated with meropenem, fluoroquinolones, orchloramphenicol.Chemoprophylaxis with rifampicin/ceftriaxone/ciprofloxacin is recommended for all close contactswith meningococcal meningitis regardless of age or immunization status. Rifampicin prophylaxisshould be given to all household contacts of patients with invasive disease caused by Haemophilusinfluenzae type b, if an immunocompromised child of any age resides in the household or closefamily member younger than 48 months has not been fully immunized.",

        "A": "Growing scalp hematoma",
        "B": "Growing fracture",
        "C": "Subdural hygroma",
        "D": "Chronic abscess"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The clinical presentation of a child with a painful and growing parietal swelling, coupled with ahistory of a prior parietal bone fracture one year ago, strongly suggests the diagnosis of a growingfracture, also known as traumatic encephalocele or leptomeningeal cysts.Skull fractures associated with a dural tear may fail to heal properly. The herniated brain, dilatedventricles, or a leptomeningeal cyst may cause an enlargement of this tear. These fractures arecalled growing skull fractures. They are usually seen in children &lt; 3 years of age.They present as a localized swelling or palpable skull defect that increases in size, most commonlyseen in the parietal region. However, they may go undetected for years and present with delayedonset of neurologic symptoms (headache, seizure, or neurologic deficit).Other options:Option A: The extended duration of one year makes scalp hematoma unlikely, as it usuallyresolves within a few months.577Option C: Subdural hygromas are characterized by fluid accumulation in the subdural space. Mostpatients with subdural hygromas are asymptomatic, but uncommon symptoms may includeheadaches, changes in mental status, nausea and vomiting, focal neurological deficits, andseizures. They don't present with scalp swelling.Option D: Chronic abscess may show inflammatory changes like erythema, pus, sinus, andsystemic features like fever.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Normal BP without pharmacological support",
        "B": "Positive spinal reflexes on stimulation",
        "C": "Sweating and tachycardia",
        "D": "Decorticate and decerebrate posturing"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Decerebrate or decorticate posturing is not seen in brain death as they are motor responses tonoxious stimuli that originate from the midbrain and cortex.Brain death, also known as death by neurologic criteria refers to the irreversible and totalcessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brainstem.The three components for diagnosing brain death are a demonstration of coexisting irreversiblecoma with a known cause, absence of brain stem reflexes, and apnea. Coma requires the patient tobe unresponsive, even to noxious stimuli. The diagnosis of brain death can still be made despitepositive spinal reflexes. (option B)Brainstem reflexes (pupillary responses, oculocephalic reflex, oculovestibular responses, cornealreflex, jaw reflex, facial grimacing, pharyngeal gag reflex, coughing) are absent. Apnea is theabsence of respiratory drive at PaCO2 of â¥60mmHg and &gt; 20mmHg above baseline, which isconsistent with brain death.The following manifestations are occasionally seen and should not be misinterpreted as evidenceof brainstem function:â¢ Normal systolic blood pressure SBP &gt;100 mmHg (option A)-â¢ Movements originating from the spinal cord or peripheral nerve may occurâ¢â¢Sweating, flushing, tachycardia (option C)â¢ Deep tendon reflexes; superficial abdominal reflexes; triple flexion responseâ¢ Babinski reflexâ¢ Spontaneous movements of limbs other than pathologic flexion or extension responseâ¢ Respiratory-like movements (shoulder elevation and adduction, back-arching, intercostalexpansion without significant tidal volumes)578",

Folic acid deficiency, especially in a young primigravida, is a risk factor for thedevelopment of NTDs in children, as seen in the given clinical vignette.NTDs result from the failure of the neural tube to close spontaneously between the 3rd and 4thweek of in utero development. These can be detected in antenatal ultrasound scans andsubsequently managed for a better prognosis. The major NTDs include the following:â¢â¢â¢Spina bifida occultaMeningoceleMyelomeningoceleâ¢Encephaloceleâ¢ Anencephalyâ¢â¢ SyringomyeliaDiastematomyelia (split spinal cord)â¢ IniencephalyIn holoprosencephaly, the forebrain fails to develop into two hemispheres due to mutations in thesonic hedgehog gene at the long arm of chromosome 7. It is a developmental disorder of the brainthat results from the defective formation of the prosencephalon and the inadequate induction ofthe forebrain structures. The three types include, alobar, semilobar, and lobar, apart from themiddle interhemispheric fusion variant or syntelencephaly.The image given below shows alobar holoprosencephaly-Solution to Question 2:A tuft of hair over the lumbosacral region in a newborn is suggestive of occult spinal dysraphismor neural tube defect. It comprises a range of conditions, including spina bifida occulta, intradural551lipoma, and dorsal dermal sinus.Spinal dysraphism is due to the defective fusion of the midline embryonic neural, vertebral, andmesenchymal structures. Associated clinical features are high-arched feet, muscle size andstrength differences between legs, and abnormal walking patterns. In newborns and younginfants, the neurological examination is usually normal, but older children may experience a lackof sensation in the perineal area and back pain.Most of the patients will have a cutaneous abnormality overlying the lower spine, including asmall dimple, a tuft of hair, or a subcutaneous lipoma.The image shows a tuft of hair in a case of spinal dysraphism:Spinal dysraphism also includes meningocele, myelomeningocele, lipomeningocele,diastematomyelia (split spinal cord), thickened filum terminale, and cauda equina tumour.The initial investigation is usually ultrasound in the neonate and the best investigation is MRI.Spina bifida is the most common type of spinal dysraphism, in which the spinal column does notclose completely, leaving the spinal cord and its protective covering exposed.552Types of spina bifidaSpina bifida occulta (mildest form)The defects in the vertebrae are so small that the spinal cord does notprotrude. They are covered by skin or may have hair growing from them.MeningoceleThe meninges protrudethrough the defect in thevertebra.Myelomeningocele(meningomyelocele)The spinal cord, with the meningealcoverings, protrude through thedefect in the vertebra.Myelomeningocele is the most severe form of spina bifida, where the spinal cord and nerve rootsare exposed and may be damaged. A sac-like protrusion, containing spinal cord tissue, meninges,and cerebrospinal fluid, is visible outside the body, often leading to significant neurologicalimpairments and disabilities.Solution to Question 3:In the given clinical scenario, the presence of abnormal sonographic markers, like the lemon andbanana sign, is highly suggestive of neural tube defects (NTDs). Acetylcholinesterase is used as abiochemical marker of neural tube defects during the screening tests.NTDs account for the largest proportion of congenital anomalies of the CNS. The failure of closureof neural tube allows excretion of fetal substances such as Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) andacetylcholinesterase into the amniotic fluid thereby serving as biochemical markers for NTDs.The lemon and banana sign, noted on antenatal imaging, are one of the many notable fruits'inspired signs. The banana sign refers to the shape of the cerebellum owing to caudaldisplacement while the lemon sign refers to the lemon-shaped head resulting from scalloping ofthe frontal bones. It is seen in fetuses with open neural tube defects.The image below shows the characteristic lemon sign on ultrasound-553The image below shows the characteristic banana sign on ultrasound-Note:Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP",

        "A": ", inhibin A, and human chorionic gonadotrophin(hCG) are the biochemical markers of trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome).Solution to Question 4:Until the time of surgery, the sac of myelomeningocele has to be covered with a sterile gauzesoaked in normal saline. This is to prevent drying and trauma to the sac. As the normal saline isless irritant to the sac, it is preferred.Note:554Surgery is done as early as possible (within a day of birth).Solution to Question 5:The given image shows an occipital bone defect with retroflexion of the neck and trunk, which istypical of iniencephaly. Inion is the tip of the external occipital protuberance and this defectcomes under the spectrum of neural tube defects.Diastematomyelia (Option A) is a congenital disorder in which a part of the spinal cord is split,usually at the level of the upper lumbar vertebra.Craniorachischisis (Option",
        "B": "is the anencephaly associated with a continuous bony defect ofthe spine and exposure of neural tissue.Holoprosencephaly (Option D) occurs when the procencephalon fails to develop into twohemispheres.Solution to Question 6:Aqueductal stenosis is the most common cause of ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus innewborns.Ventriculomegaly is the dilation of the ventricles. When ventriculomegaly occurs in associationwith raised cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, it is called hydrocephalus.Pathologic etiologies can be congenital or acquired. Congenital causes include structuralabnormalities such as aqueductal stenosis, agenesis of the corpus callosum, Dandy-Walkermalformations, Chiari malformations, and neural tube defects. Acquired causes are intracranialinfections(cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis), intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic injury, and brainparenchymal tumors.Aqueductal stenosis is the narrowing or obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct, a narrow channelthat connects the third and fourth ventricles in the brain. As a result, the fluid accumulates withinthe ventricles, causing them to enlarge.Treatment for aqueductal stenosis includes ventriculostomy, diuretics, serial lumbar punctures inspecific cases, and CSF diversion. In severe cases, CSF diversion procedures (shunting), may benecessary to redirect the flow of CSF and relieve pressure on the brain.555MCirculation of CSFLateral VentriclenInterventricular Foramina(Foramina of Monro)Third VentricleCerebral Aqueduot(&queduct of Sylvius)Fourth VentricleForamina of LusohkaForamenpubof MagendieSubarachnoidLateral ventricleToramanof Monno)Dura maiorCentral canal ofChorold PlexCBF ProcanmeCentral Canal of SpinalGordthe lateral ventricleOMARROWSolution to Question 7:The clinical features of frequent vomiting, large head, bulging fontanelles, and a positive sunsetsign (as seen in the image) point to a likely diagnosis of hydrocephalus. A vein of Galenmalformation can expand to become large and, because of its midline position, obstruct the flowof CSF, thereby causing an obstructive or non-communicating hydrocephalus. Vomiting is more inthe morning and becomes better when sitting due to poor absorption of CSF in a lying downposition.Hydrocephalus is not a specific disease; it represents a diverse group of conditions that resultfrom impaired circulation or absorption of CSF.Causes of hydrocephalus:Communicating(external/non-obstructive)Achondroplasia (raised ICP due to jugular foramen stenosis)Choroid plexus papillomaMeningeal malignancyMeningitisPosthemorrhagicSarcoidosiSNon-communicating(internal/obstructive)Aqueductal stenosisArnold-Chiari malformationDandy-Walker malformationKlippel-Feil syndromeTumours and neurocutaneous disorders (astrocytoma)Vein of Galen malformationSolution to Question 8:The features of hydrocephalus like irritability along with macrocephaly, hypotonia and spasticityindicate a likely diagnosis of Dandy-Walker syndrome. A positive transillumination test is presentin this syndrome. The child has developmental delay especially in motor and cognitive milestones556because normally children walk independently at 12-13 months and become dry by day around 18months.The Dandy-Walker malformation consists of a cystic expansion of the fourth ventricle in theposterior fossa and midline cerebellar hypoplasia. It results from a developmental failure of theroof of the fourth ventricle during embryogenesis. Most of the affected patients havehydrocephalus, agenesis of the posterior cerebellar vermis, and corpus callosum. Brisk tendonreflexes, spasticity, clonus, Babinski sign, cerebellar ataxia, and delayed motor and cognitivemilestones are seen in this. Management is by shunting if hydrocephalus is present.The image below shows a sagittal section of the magnetic resonance tomography scan of a patientwith Dandy-Walker syndrome.Solution to Question 9:Dandy-VValker malformationNormalDandy-WalkerâMARROVV557Symptoms of poor feeding and frequent vomiting with signs of enlarged head circumference and apositive sunset and Macewen sign(crack-pot resonance) points toward a diagnosis ofhydrocephalus. Aqueductal stenosis is the most common cause of hydrocephalus. Out of the aboveoptions, mumps infection can cause stenosis of the cerebral aqueduct.Mumps is associated in a child with aqueductal stenosis because-â¢ Mumps virus is neurotropic and is thought to enter the CNS via the choroid plexus and infect thechoroidal epithelium and ependymal cells.â¢â¢ CNS complications of mumps include meningitis, meningoencephalitis (most commonlymanifests 5 days after the parotitis), transverse myelitis, aqueductal stenosis, and facial palsy.Solution to Question 10:Among the given options, schizencephaly is a neuronal migration defect. MRI is the study ofchoice for elucidating schizencephaly and associated malformations.Neuronal migration is the process during brain development, where the neuronal cells migrate totheir proper designated site by various mechanisms, to form the 6-layered cerebral cortex. Anyabnormality in the above process leads to neuronal migration defects.â¢Neuronal migration defect includes the following:Schizencephaly: (schiz = split or cleavage) It is the presence of unilateral or bilateral clefts withinthe cerebral hemispheres. The patient can be severely intellectually challenged, withmicrocephaly, seizures, and spastic quadriparesis.The image below shows schizencephaly:â¢ Lissencephaly (agyria): It is the absence of cerebral convolutions. Rather than the normal 6layers of the cortex, there may be fewer layers. The child will have developmental delay,microcephaly, and seizures.The image below shows lissencephaly:558Myelomeningocele (Option B) is a neural tube defect that occurs due to defective closure of theneural tube.Lhermitte-Duclos disease (Option",
