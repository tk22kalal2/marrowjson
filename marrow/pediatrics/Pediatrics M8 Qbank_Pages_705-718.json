It is characterized by anuncontrolled activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes and macrophages. It is the result of acytokine storm that leads to a dysregulated inflammatory activation of the immune system, withrapid progression to multiorgan failure if not promptly diagnosed and properly treated. It ischaracterized by the following:• Macrophage hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow•⚫ Hypofibrinogenemia (paradoxical fall in erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR])⚫ Hypertriglyceridemia714• Extreme hyperferritinemia• Fever &gt;38.5°C●Splenomegaly.Cytopenia affecting at least two of three cell lineagesTreatment usually includes high-dose corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents in refractorycases.",

      "question": "A mother brought her 12-day old baby to the OPD due to the rash shown in the picture for thelast 5 days. The mother says the rash gets worse in the sun. The infant was born at home andshe never had a prenatal check-up. She herself has a history of joint pains and a facial rashwhich she says is \"no big deal\". On examination, Vitals are normal for the baby.

        "D": "Antihistone antibodies"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The baby has raccoon eyes (periorbital rash) with complete heart block (P-R dissociation)suggestive of neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE). Anti-Ro antibodies are used todiagnose neonatal lupus.Neonatal Lupus Erythematosus(NLE):NLE is not an autoimmune condition. It occurs when maternal autoantibodies enter the fetalcirculation (passive transfer). The antibodies responsible for this condition are anti-Roantibody (anti-SSA) and anti-La antibody (anti-SSB).The periorbital rash typically appears within 6 weeks of life and lasts 3-4 months. However, it canbe present at birth. Infants may also have cytopenias and hepatitis, but the most fearedcomplication is congenital heart block. Cardiomyopathy is seen in the most severe cases. Thenoncardiac manifestations of neonatal lupus are usually reversible, whereas congenital heart blockis permanent. Conduction system abnormalities can be detected in utero by fetal echocardiogrambeginning at 16 weeks of gestational age.Fluorinated corticosteroids seem to improve cases of hydrops. Significant conduction systemabnormalities after birth are treated with cardiac pacing and occasionally intravenousimmunoglobulin and steroids, while severe cardiomyopathy may require cardiac transplantation.Transient, noncardiac manifestations are conservatively managed, with topical steroids usedoccasionally to treat the rash.Other options:Anti-Jo antibodies are a type of myositis-specific antibodies. These are not related to neonatallupus.Anti-dsDNA antibodies are specific for SLE (Systemic Lupus erythematosus).Anti-histone antibodies are present in Drug-induced SLE.Note:SS in SSA and SSB stands for Sjögren's syndrome-related. Anti-SSA and anti SSB are antinuclearantibodies and are mainly found in patients with SLE and Sjögren's syndrome.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario showing swelling of knee joints (arthritis), non-blanching rash in thelower limbs (palpable purpura), along with hematuria and proteinuria (renal involvement) in achild is suggestive of Henoch Schonlein purpura (HSP).HSP (IgA vasculitis) is a small vessel vasculitis most commonly seen in the age group of 3-8 years.It generally follows an upper respiratory tract infection and there is a history of atopy in one-thirdof the cases.The pathology of HSP involves leukocytoclastic vasculitis and the deposition of IgA in the affectedblood vessels. IgA is deposited in the glomerular mesangium in a distribution similar to that ofIgA nephropathy.Clinical manifestations include palpable purpura, the hallmark feature of HSP, whichcharacteristically involves the extensor surfaces of arms and legs. Musculoskeletal symptoms suchas arthritis and arthralgia are common. Gastrointestinal symptoms can include abdominal pain,vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding. Renal involvement may lead to gross or microscopic hematuria,nephritic syndrome, or nephrotic syndrome. Renal manifestations are more severe in adults. Arapidly progressive form of glomerulonephritis is seen in some cases. Nephritis usually follows theappearance of the rash.Diagnosis of HSP is primarily based on clinical findings, including the palpable purpura, alongwith the presence of other symptoms. Laboratory tests are not specific to HSP but may shownonspecific markers of inflammation and sometimes elevated levels of IgA. Imaging studies andbiopsies of affected tissues can provide additional diagnostic informationTreatment of HSP is generally supportive, focusing on hydration, pain relief, and nutrition.Corticosteroids may be used in severe cases or for significant gastrointestinal involvement.Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) and plasma exchange are occasionally employed for severedisease. Nephritis due to IgA vasculitis should be treated with immunosuppressantslike prednisolone and azathioprine. Complications of HSP can include serious gastrointestinalproblems, kidney disease, and recurrences, but overall, the prognosis for childhood HSP isfavorable. Regular monitoring of blood pressure and urine is recommended to detect and managepotential complications.",
