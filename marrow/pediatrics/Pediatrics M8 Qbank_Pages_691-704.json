      "explanation": "The structure marked as B in the image represents dystrophin protein (a sarcolemmal protein),which is absent in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) due to a mutation in the dystrophingene.This gene is located on the short arm of chromosome X near the p21 locus (Xp21). Lack ofdystrophin leads to cellular instability, which leads to progressive leakage of intracellularcomponents.The Dystrophin-glycoprotein complexSarcoglycancomplexOMARROW698-Dystrophin-associatedcomplex-Dystrophin-ActinMyofibril",

      "explanation": "The image shows winging of the scapula, which when combined with this patient's features aresuggestive of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy.Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy is an autosomal dominant condition that generally presents withasymmetric weakness in facial and shoulder girdle muscles. Occasionally, finger and wristweakness is the first symptom.The mouth is rounded and appears puckered because of the protruding lips. Upper facialweakness will manifest as an inability to close the eyes completely in sleep. Scapular winging isprominent, even in infants. Flattening or even concavity of the deltoid contour is seen, and thebiceps and triceps brachii muscles are wasted and weak. Eventually, proximal muscles getinvolved and undergo atrophy, and Gowers sign &amp; Trendelenburg gait appear. Lumbarlordosis, foot drop, and kyphoscoliosis are common complications.Treatment includes orthopedic measures for scoliosis and foot drop, surgical intervention forscapular deformity.

      "question": "A 7-year-old child presents with leg pain. She had fever and cough 3 days prior. Currently,there is pain on palpation of the calf muscles. Reflexes and other clinical examinations arenormal. Lab test reveals CK levels of 2000 IU. What is the likely diagnosis?",

        "D": "Dermatomyositis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The clinical picture showing pain in the calves occuring within a week of an upper respiratorytract infection (URI), with elevated creatine kinase levels suggests the diagnosis of viral myositis.The specific history of URI suggests influenza myositis.Infectious myositis has a male predominance and is typically seen in young adults. Childhoodform presents with fever, malaise, and rhinorrhea and is usually followed by severe pain,especially in the calves. The muscle pain is usually worse with movement and the symptoms lastfor about a week. In children, toe walking and wide-based gait may be seen because of theinvolvement of the gastrocnemius-soleus muscles.Other viral causes of myositis include HIV-1 (one of the most common causes of myositis), groupB coxsackievirus (epidemic myalgia), HTLV-1 (Human T-lymphotropic virus), andcytomegalovirus (CMV).Lab features of influenza myositis include elevated CK which may be as high as 500 times normalthe value. Urine myoglobin is usually positive. Detection of the virus with PCR testing ofnasopharyngeal specimens can be carried out but is not of much clinical significance. Thehistopathological examination would reveal muscle fiber necrosis without much inflammatorychange.Treatment includes bed rest, IV fluids, and symptomatic management with analgesics andantipyretics. Amantadine and other antiviral agents may be considered in adults. Complicationsinclude myocarditis and respiratory dysfunction. Rhabdomyolysis is an uncommon complication.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Among the given options, only Spinal muscular atrophy presents in infancy. The rest present inlate childhood.Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a degenerative disease of motor neurons, that is inherited inan autosomal recessive manner. It usually starts in infancy with hypotonia, hyporeflexia, and thinmuscle mass (atrophy). Polyhydramnios may be present prenatally due to weakness inswallowing.Diagnosis is done by genetic testing for SMN gene mutation. Muscle biopsy is done for cases withnegative genetic testing and strong clinical suspicion. The muscle biopsy in infancy shows acharacteristic pattern of perinatal denervation that is unlike that of a mature muscle. Groups ofgiant type I fibers are mixed with fascicles of severely atrophic fibers.Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.Recent updates:• Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide approved by the FDA for treating SMA. It isadministered intrathecally.• Risdiplam (first oral drug) has been approved by FDA to treat infants &gt;2 months of age withSMA. It is an oral splicing modifier that corrects the splicing defect of SMN2, which leads to701increased levels of full-length SMN protein.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A maculopapular rash over the metacarpophalangeal joints is indicative of Gottron papules in achild with proximal muscle weakness is suggestive of juvenile dermatomyositis. As it is aninflammatory myopathy, the next investigation is serum creatine kinase.Though the gold standard investigation is a muscle biopsy, it is indicated only when the diagnosisis in doubt or when grading of the disease severity is required. Nerve conduction studies areusually normal unless associated with severe muscle necrosis and atrophy. Electromyographywould show the characteristic signs of myopathy and muscle fiber necrosis but is preferablyperformed in a specialized center.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The patient's clinical features along with the history of myotonia in the mother are suggestive ofMyotonic dystrophy. Facial weakness, inverted V-shaped upper lip, and loss of muscle mass in thetemporal fossae are characteristic of myotonic muscular dystrophy.A severe congenital form of myotonic dystrophy appears in infants born to mothers withsymptomatic myotonic dystrophy. It is inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait. Clinical featuresinclude:• Skeletal deformities (clubfoot deformities alone or congenital contractures involving many jointsand can even include the cervical spine).• Generalized hypotonia and weakness at birth•• Facial wasting and weakness••Inverted V-shaped upper lip• Loss of muscle mass in the temporal fossaInfants can require gavage feeding or ventilator support for respiratory muscle weakness orapnea.Other Options:Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), type 1 (which is most common) presents in infancy withhypotonia but has no facial features that are present in this child.In Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the baby appears normal at birth and the facial features presentin this child are not seen.Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy presents with predominant involvement of scapular andhumeral muscles.
