      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The presence of high GH levels and low insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) levels pointtowards Laron syndrome/dwarfism. It is caused by end-organ resistance to growth hormone (GHinsensitivity) due to the GH receptor mutation. It is an autosomal-recessive disorder with clinicalfeatures as those seen in pituitary dwarfism.Here, growth hormone is produced but is unable to act on the target tissues. Thus, the resting andstimulated GH levels are high and IGF-1 levels are low.In Turner's syndrome (Option A), loss of the short arm of the X chromosome is implicated indwarfism. The short stature occurs due to a state of GH resistance, relative deficiency, anddecreased utilization.Pituitary dwarfism (Option B) is a condition with GH deficiency.Maternal deprivation dwarfism (Option D) is due to psychosocial causes such as emotionaldeprivation and neglect. There is an inadequate response to GH stimulation tests. The mechanismis not fully understood. No history suggestive of disturbed maternal or family relationships rulesthis out.",

It is transported to the posterior pituitary via axonal projections, where it isstored for release into the systemic circulation.Diabetes insipidus (DI) is characterized by pathologic polyuria and polydipsia (&gt;2 L/m²/24 hr or5 mL/kg/hr). It can result from either:• Vasopressin deficiency (decreased anti-diuretic hormone production) causes central DI.• Vasopressin insensitivity at the level of the kidney causes nephrogenic DI.",
