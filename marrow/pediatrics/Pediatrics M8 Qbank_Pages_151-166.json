      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Scurvy is a deficiency of vitamin C. The correct answer is 1, 3, 5. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, which cannot be synthesized in the human body due to a deficient L-gulonolactone oxidase enzyme. Breast milk contains adequate amounts of ascorbic acid, whereas the pasteurization of animal milk at high temperature destroys vitamin C. Functions of Vitamin C / Ascorbic Acid : • Synthesis of collagen (hydroxylation of proline, which is vital for collagen; in the formation of the bone matrix). • Neurotransmitter metabolism (conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine and tryptophan to serotonin) • Cholesterol metabolism (conversion of cholesterol to steroid hormones and bile acids) • Biosynthesis of carnitine • Antioxidation (electron donor) • For the cellular and immunologic functions of the hematopoietic system.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The given clinical vignette is suggestive of chronic zinc deficiency. Zinc deficiency affects both cell-mediated and humoral immunity. The cell-mediated immunity is impaired predominantly, as zinc is essential for T-cell division, maturation, and differentiation. In a child with a phytate-rich diet, a chronic deficiency of zinc and iron usually co-exist. Isolated chronic zinc deficiency can be seen in the setting of a child suffering from chronic diarrhea, repeated pneumonia or chest infections, and congenital malabsorption disorders. Chronic zinc deficiency manifests as: • Dwarfism. • Hypogonadism • Dermatitis of extremities and around orifices • T-cell immunodeficiency • Diarrhea. The features of acute zinc deficiency include: • Decreased growth • Poor wound healing • Diarrhea.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The clinical vignette is suggestive of acute selenium toxicity. Selenium toxicity is characterized by nausea, diarrhea, neurologic manifestations, nail and hair changes, and a garlicky odor. It is commonly seen in areas where drinking water and the cultivated soil is extremely rich in selenium. In India, selenium toxicity is endemic to agricultural sites located in the states of Punjab and Haryana. The presentations are usually acute in nature rather than chronic. Chromium toxicity (Option B) is commonly seen only in adults with occupational exposure. Chromium is a pulmonary irritant and the symptoms are predominantly respiratory complaints similar to bronchitis. They also cause chronic allergic dermatitis and are carcinogenic too. Molybdenum toxicity (Option C) is very rarely seen in humans. It manifests usually as acute diarrhea. Iodine toxicity (Option D) can range from mild GI illness to chronic thyroid dysfunction varying from hyperthyroidism to papillary thyroid carcinoma.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The clinical vignette is suggestive of Menkes disease or Tricholipodystrophy or Steely hair disease, caused by copper deficiency. It is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by a mutation in ATP7A, which encodes for a copper-transporting ATPase polypeptide, leading to the disruption of copper transport in the intestine. The clinical features include: \n      • Failure to thrive (first presenting complaint)\n      • Neurological degeneration (myeloneuropathy)\n      • Infections\n      • Hair abnormalities (kinky hair with pili torti seen on a trichogram).\n      These infants have a characteristic cherubic appearance with a depressed nasal bridge, pudgy cheeks, 'Cupid's bow' upper lip, and doughy skin. A therapeutic trial with copper-histidine may be helpful. Option A: De Vivo disease is a metabolic disorder due to GLUT1 deficiency.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The above scenario is suggestive of scurvy. A child who presents with a cry on touching or lifting is usually due to subperiosteal hemorrhages. Scurvy/Barlow's Disease is caused due to the deficiency of vitamin C, especially in children fed predominantly on heat-treated cow's milk. High temperature destroys vitamin C. JRA - Juvenile Rheumatoid arthritis (Option B) rarely presents in infancy. Rickets (Option C) presents with growth retardation or other features such as craniotabes, craniosynostosis in infancy. It is generally associated with individuals who have a milk-deficient diet. Caffey's disease (Option D) is infantile cortical hyperostosis. It usually presents at 6 months of age with painful soft tissue swelling and bone thickening. The mandible is the most common bone involved.",

      "explanation": "The given image shows spina bifida, the most common neural tube defect (NTD). 4000 mcg of folic acid periconceptionally is given to prevent NTDs in subsequent pregnancies. The normal dose of folic acid in pregnancy is 400 mcg (0.4 mg). However, the history of a previous pregnancy with an NTD raises the risk of another NTD in subsequent pregnancies. An increased dose of folic acid is thus prophylactically given during the periconceptional period to prevent NTD in the next child.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The clinical vignette is suggestive of Pellagra secondary to Hartnup's disease. The vitamin deficient in this condition is niacin. The precursor of niacin is tryptophan and not tyrosine. Niacin/vitamin B3 is a constituent of NAD and NADP. Its deficiency occurs in a maize-based diet (maize is deficient in tryptophan), carcinoid syndrome (all the tryptophan is converted to serotonin), and Hartnup disease (defective absorption from intestine and kidney). Niacin is the only lipid-lowering agent that lowers lipoprotein(a) levels significantly. It also results in a decrease in LDL, VLDL, and triglycerides along with an increase in HDL cholesterol. Niacin deficiency causes pellagra (3Ds) - Diarrhoea, Dermatitis (Cassal's necklace), Dementia, and finally death. Niacin toxicity manifests as: prostaglandin-mediated cutaneous flushing, glucose intolerance, and fulminant hepatitis (most fatal complication). Hartnup's disease is due to impaired renal and intestinal absorption of tryptophan and other neutral amino acids. It is characterized by a varied clinical presentation including ataxia (lack of muscle control), delayed mental development, diarrhoea, and dermatitis (pellagra-like symptoms as tryptophan is a precursor of niacin). Diagnosis of niacin deficiency secondary to Hartnup's disease is based on neutral aminoaciduria and increased excretion of indole compounds detected by the Obermeyer test.",

        "D": "Atopic dermatitis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A child with eczematous rash typically in the perioral and perineal region is characteristic of acrodermatitis enteropathica, which is due to secondary zinc deficiency. It is an autosomal recessive disorder seen in infants due to a defect in the intestinal zinc-specific transporter gene. Oral zinc therapy is the preferred management. It classically presents while weaning from breast milk to formula, which has lower zinc bioavailability than breast milk. The symptoms are perioral and perineal rashes, periungual dermatitis - Beau's lines on nails, chronic diarrhea, and alopecia. Children commonly present with symmetrical, eczematous plaques that become vesicular, bullous, pustular, or erosive with characteristic crusting at the edges. The perioral eruption usually spares the upper lip, giving it a U-shaped or horseshoe-shaped appearance. Investigations would reveal low serum zinc. Oral zinc therapy is the treatment of choice (3mg/kg/24 hour). Option A: Wiskott Aldrich syndrome is the classical triad of thrombocytopenia, eczema, and recurrent pyogenic infections. No history of bleeding rules out this option. Option C: Epidermolysis bullosa presents as bullous lesions in pressure-handling areas. Option D: In atopic dermatitis, usually the lesions will be itchy and distributed in extensor aspects (flexural in adults).",
