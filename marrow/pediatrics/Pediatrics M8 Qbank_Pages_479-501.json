      "explanation": "Isoprenaline/isoproterenol should be avoided in tet or hypercyanotic spells. It will causea decrease in total peripheral resistance (TPR) or systemic vascular resistance (SVR). So, moreblood leaves the left ventricle leading to the increased right to left shunt. This results in theworsening of right ventricular outflow and causes worsening of cyanosis and the symptoms.Treatment of hypercyanotic spell involves placing child in knee-chest position (or squatting), anduse of:• oxygen•morphine - sedates the patient•⚫ sodium bicarbonate - to counteract metabolic acidosis that develops when arterial Po2 &lt;40mmHg• alpha-agonists (phenylephrine)- vasopressor used in severe cases⚫ beta-blockers (propranolol)- improves resting saturation and decreases the frequency of spells.Drugs that increase SVR, such as IV phenylephrine (alpha-1 agonist) or propranolol (non-selectivebeta-antagonist/beta-2 block), can improve right ventricular outflow, decrease the right-to-leftshunt, and improve the symptoms.

Deoxygenated blood is being shunted into the systemic circulation after theclosure of PDA. Hence, you should maintain the patency of the duct with PGE1 infusion untilsurgery can be done.Duct-dependent lesions: Anomalies, in a newborn with CHD, which are dependent on the patencyof ductus arteriosus for survival.•Right-sided lesions (Tetralogy of Fallot, PA/PS) cannot pump blood to the lungs. These patientsare dependent on an open PDA for pulmonary circulation.•Left-sided lesions (Hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Aortic stenosis, Coarctation of aorta) cannotpump blood into the systemic circulation. These patients are dependent on open PDA for systemiccirculation.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given chest x-ray shows 'coeur-en-sabot' or boot-shaped heart, which is seen in tetralogy ofFallot (TOF).The characteristic silhouette is due to cardiac apex elevation as a result of right ventricularhypertrophy. The hilar areas and lung fields are relatively clear because of diminished pulmonaryblood flow or the small size of the pulmonary arteries and the aorta is usually enlarged.The image below describes the likeness of the cardiac silhouette to a boot:Tetralogy of Fallot-boot-shaped heartRTOF is cyanotic congenital heart disease with the following four components:• Obstruction to right ventricular outflow (pulmonary stenosis)• Malalignment type of ventricular septal defect (VSD)•• Dextroposition of the aorta so that it overrides the ventricular septum (overriding of the aorta)Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)The severity of symptoms depends on the degree of the right ventricular outflow obstruction. Inmild degrees, the symptoms become pronounced as the baby grows due to RV infundibularhypertrophy and may present with heart failure. In severe degrees, pulmonary blood flowpredominantly depends on the ductus arteriosus. As soon as the duct closes, the baby presentswith cyanosis and circulatory collapse in the neonatal period.Clinical features include significant hypercyanotic spells in infants which are characterised byhyperpnea, cyanosis, and gasping followed by syncope. The spells occur most frequently in themorning on initially awakening or after episodes of vigorous crying. These spells are due to aprolonged reduction of pulmonary blood flow resulting in severe systemic hypoxia and metabolicacidosis.Older children present with exertional dyspnea and assume a squatting position to relieve thedyspneic episode after which the child is able to resume the activity.500",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The given chest x-ray shows an egg-on-string appearance seen in the transposition of greatarteries (TGA). Enlargement of the left atrium is seen in TGA, not the right atrium.The reason for left atrial enlargement is due to increased pulmonary blood flow.TGA is characterized by the aorta arising from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery fromthe left ventricle. This abnormal configuration leads to a narrow vascular pedicle.As pulmonary vascular resistance drops during the first few days of life, blood flow through thepulmonary vasculature is increased. There is also elevated pulmonary venous pressure seen inTGA, especially in infants with an intact interventricular septum.The globular (egg) appearance of the heart due to abnormal convexity of the right atrial borderand left atrial enlargement, and the narrow superior mediastinum (string) result in the classicalegg-on-string appearance.TGA is the most specific heart disease in infants of diabetic mothers.Early management includes an immediate infusion of prostaglandin E1 which keeps the ductusarteriosus patent for improving oxygenation. Rashkind balloon atrial septostomy is a palliativecatheter-based intervention that can be done to improve the hypoxic state before definitivesurgery. The procedure creates an opening in the atrial septum which allows betterinter-circulatory mixing of the blood. Jatene arterial switch procedure is the definitive surgery.Most infants with TGA do not survive till adulthood without corrective surgery.",
