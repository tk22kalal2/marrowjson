      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The clinical presentation of a young girl with continuous dribbling of urine, despite normalvoiding, strongly suggests the diagnosis of an ectopic ureter.An ectopic ureter refers to a condition where the ureter drains outside the bladder. It is morecommon in females and opens either into the urethra below the sphincter or into the vagina.Hence, they present with constant urinary dripping all day, even though the child voids regularly(paradoxical incontinence).The terminal part of the ureter is frequently narrowed, leading to hydroureteronephrosis. Urinarytract infections (UTIs) are common due to urinary stasis.In males, ectopic ureters usually enter the posterior urethra above the external sphincter, hencethey are usually continent and most patients present with UTI or epididymitis.Investigations include renal ultrasound (USG), voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), and renal scanto assess function. USG shows a hydronephrotic kidney or dilated upper pole and ureter. If thereis a satisfactory function, the recommended treatment options are ureteral reimplantation intothe bladder or ureteroureterostomy. The poor function may require partial or total nephrectomy.Other options:Option B: A ureterocele is a cystic dilation of the terminal ureter, typically obstructive due to asmall ureteral opening. In childhood, they commonly present with infections. Larger ureterocelescan cause obstruction at the bladder neck.Option C: Congenital megaureter (dilated ureter) presents UTI, urinary stones, hematuria, andflank pain because of urinary stasis.Option D: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is characterized by the retrograde flow of urine from thebladder to the ureter and kidney. They usually present with recurrent attacks of UTI.",
