Developmental progression of the grasp: • At 6 months, the infant reaches and holds a larger object in a crude manner using the ulnar aspect of his hand (Ulnar palmar grasp). At 8-9 months, the object is grasped by the radial side of the palm (radial palmar grasp). • At 9 months, the immature pincer grasp develops. The object is secured between the adducted thumb and the extended index finger. • At 12 months, the mature pincer grasp develops. The object is secured between the opposed thumb and the tip of the index finger.",

      "question": "You are taking a detailed history from the parents of a child with a suspected autism spectrum disorder. Parents are worried that their child does not smile or maintain eye contact and is not interested in toys. At what ages should a typical child exhibit a 'social smile' and 'stranger anxiety'?",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Social smile is typically seen at 2 months and stranger anxiety at 6 months. Social smile: At 1 month of age, a child smiles involuntarily. At 2 months of age, social smile develops; that is, the child smiles voluntarily and reciprocally, in response to someone else's smile. Stranger anxiety: Before 6 months, the child is sociable and friendly even with strangers. At 6 months, there is an onset of stranger anxiety; infants look back and forth between an approaching stranger and parent and may cling or cry anxiously.",

She then takes the ball and hides it under a blanket in front of him. The child confusedly stares at the blanket and cries instead of searching for it. What is being tested here?",

        "A": "Separation anxiety",
        "B": "Transitional object space",
        "C": "Symbolic transformation",
        "D": "Object permanence"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Understanding that objects continue to exist even when not seen is called object permanence. This is due to an ability to form a mental representation of the object. It is attained at the age of 8-9 months. Option A: Separation anxiety begins at about 9 months of age. Children wake up crying from their naps as they realize that their parents are not in the same room as them. This is different from stranger anxiety displayed by the child at the age of 6-7 months, wherein they react to approaching strangers by crying or clinging to their parent. Option B: A transitional object is an object, such as a blanket or a stuffed toy, that is used by many children as a symbol of the absent parent. It is seen at around 18 months. Option C: Symbolic transformations in play: At 12 months - make-believe (symbolic) play centres on the child's own body, e.g., the child pretends to drink from an empty cup. At 18 months - symbolic transformations in play are not limited to the child's body, e.g., a doll can be fed from a plate.",

      "question": "Parents of a 9-month-old infant, with a history of preterm delivery and prolonged NICU stay, are concerned that the child is lagging behind in his milestones. You would suspect a developmental delay in this child if his developmental quotient (DQ) is below",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "A developmental delay should be suspected if the development quotient (DQ) is below 70%. It is calculated as: DQ = Developmental age x 100 / Chronological age. From the highest milestones achieved by the child, the developmental age in a particular domain is calculated. The chronological age is the actual age in term babies. However, in preterm infants, a corrected age rather than postnatal age is used till two years of age. This is used to account for the small gap in neurological development that premature children have yet to catch up. For example, a child born at 32 weeks gestation (gestational age) seen at 12 weeks of age (postnatal age), should be considered as a 4-week-old (corrected age) child. If there is a delay (DQ < 70%) in more than 2 domains, then global developmental delay (GDD) is suspected.",
