Puhl's lesion is chronic tuberculosis (TB) of the apex of thelung, not seen in the primary infection.313The majority of children develop no signs or symptoms at any level.In primary pulmonary disease, the combination of the parenchymal pulmonary lesion and thecorresponding lymph node is called Ghon's complex or the primary complex. Asymptomaticpleural effusion is common and forms part of the primary complex. Erosion of a parenchymalfocus of tuberculosis into the blood or lymphatic vessel can result in dissemination of the bacilliand a miliary pattern, with small nodules evenly distributed on the chest radiograph. Sputumsmear-negative TB does not rule out pediatric pulmonary TB.Chronic pulmonary tuberculosis is common in children above 7 years of age. The commonest siteis the apex of the lung―Puhl's lesion. Regional lymph nodes are not involved.The most common site of extrapulmonary tuberculosis in children is the lymph node.NOTE:• Ranke complex: Ghon's complex undergoes fibrosis and calcification.• Simon focus: Hematogenous spread to the apex of the upper lobe, resulting in a post-primaryinfective lesion, which heals with scarring.• Simmond's focus: Tuberculous focus in the liver.•Weigert focus: Caseating metastatic tuberculous focus in the wall of a pulmonary vein.• Rich focus: Tuberculous granuloma occurring in the cortex of the brain.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of neonatal tetanus. It is caused by a neurotoxin producedby Clostridium tetani, which inhibits inhibitory neurons, not excitatory neurons.Clostridium tetani is a spore-forming obligate anaerobe commonly found in soil, dust, andgastrointestinal tracts of various animals. The baby's umbilical stump covered with cow dungserves as the source of infection. It also occurs in infants of unimmunized mothers. Tetanustypically manifests within 3-12 days of birth as progressive difficulty in feeding, rigidity, orspasms.Tetanus toxin binds at the neuromuscular junction and enters the motor nerve; it is thentransported to the alpha-motoneuron via retrograde axonal transport. Subsequently, the toxinenters the adjacent spinal inhibitory interneurons, where it prevents the release of theneurotransmitters glycine and y-aminobutyric acid. This leads to blockade of normal antagonisticmuscle inhibition, while agonist muscles undergo sustained contraction without relaxing.Neonatal tetanus presents with progressive feeding difficulty (sucking and swallowing),irritability, and crying. Characteristic features include reduced movement or complete muscleparalysis, rigidity, and spasms. These features may or may not be associated with opisthotonos.Treatment includes supportive care in the form of muscle relaxants (diazepam), along with theadministration of human tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) and metronidazole, which is theantibiotic of choice. Parenteral penicillin G can serve as an alternate antibiotic.Excising the umbilical stump in a baby with neonatal tetanus is no longer recommended.",

Iron isessential for the production of toxins in diphtheria.It is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Carriers are the most common causes of infection.Immunization does not prevent the carrier state. It spreads via droplets through the respiratorytract (most important), cutaneous lesions, and fomites.The regulation of toxin production in the bacterium is partially controlled by iron, thus making itan important prerequisite for toxin production.Clinical features:•••• Respiratory tract diphtheria (most common):Thick, adherent pseudomembrane (grey or white) on one/both tonsils and adjacent pharynx.Dislodging of the membrane may cause bleeding.Underlying soft tissue edema and enlarged lymph nodes can cause a bull-neck appearance• Patients with laryngeal diphtheria are at risk for suffocation because of local soft-tissue edemaand airway obstruction by the diphtheritic membrane.DAILYROUNDS•Cutaneous diphtheria is an indolent, non-progressive infection characterized by a superficial,ecthyma-like, non-healing ulcer with a gray-brown membrane.• Occasionally, it causes mucocutaneous infections at other sites, such as otitis externa, purulentconjunctivitis, and vulvo-vaginitis.Diagnosis: The culture of the organism from the nose and throat swab specimens is the goldstandard. Demonstration of the toxin is done by Elek's gel precipitation test.

      "explanation": "Skin penetration is the most common route by which the larva of Ancylostomaduodenale (hookworm) enters the human body.Ancylostoma duodenale (hookworm) larvae enter the human host by skin penetration andundergo extraintestinal migration through the venous circulation to the lungs. They enter alveoliand climb up to the bronchial tree and pharynx, and are swallowed. Larvae reach the smallintestine and become adult worms.Clinical manifestations include iron deficiency anemia, resulting from chronic occult intestinalblood loss. Dermatitis, sometimes referred to as ground itch, may occur when they penetratehuman skin. Eosinophilic pneumonia can also be seen.Infection with a zoonotic hookworm, especially Ancylostoma braziliense, can result in the lateralmigration of the larvae causing cutaneous tracts of cutaneous larva migrans.The image below shows the lifecycle of the intestinal hookworm.319ODPDXIntestinal Hookworm3Development tofilariform larva inenviornmentRhabditiform larvahatchesInfective stageDiagnostic stageFilariform larvapenetrates skinC D CLarvae exit circulationin the lungs; they arethen coughed up andswallowed.Eggs in fecesThe image given below shows cutaneous larva migrans.5Ancylostoma spp. larvaecan become developmentallyarrested and dormant in tissues.Re-activated larvae may enterthe small intestine.Adults in small intestineAncylostoma Ancylostoma Necatorduodenale ceylanicum americanusTreatment:• Mebendazole 100 mg bid, orally, for 3 days or single dose of 500 mg•Albendazole 400 mg, orally, once",

      "explanation": "The likely cause of seizures in a child who has multiple ring-enhancing lesions and dietary historyof pork intake is an infection with Taenia solium.Children acquire the adult form of the parasite by ingestion of undercooked pork containinglarvae cysts. In the intestines, the cyst converts into adult form. The adult form releases eggs inthe stool.If the eggs are ingested (shed by tapeworm carriers or by unhygienic practices), the larvae arereleased from the eggs. The larva then invades through the intestines and migrate through thebloodstream to the muscles (and other organs), where they form tissue cysts called cysticercosis.When these larvae find their way to the brain, it is termed as neurocysticercosis.321Neurocysticercosis typically presents with seizures (focal or generalized). It can be associated withbasilar arachnoiditis that can present with signs of meningeal irritation. Cysticerci in the tissuesmay present with focal findings from the mass effect. Ocular neurocysticercosis causes decreasedvisual acuity because of cysticerci in the retina or vitreous, retinal detachment, or iridocyclitis.Treatment includes management of seizures. albendazole therapy (treatment of choice).Praziquantel can also be used.",

Theseverity of the disease in the neonate is greater if the woman gets infected early in herpregnancy. The causative agent is Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate intracellular protozoan.322The diagnosis is made by the detection of IgM anti-toxoplasma antibodies. IgG can cross theplacenta is hence, cannot confirm infection in the infant. IgM immunosorbent agglutination assay(ISAGA) and IgA ELISA are the most useful diagnostic tests.Spiramycin can be administered for cases of acute infection in early pregnancy to reduce verticaltransmission. It does not cross the placenta and therefore cannot be used to treat an infectedfetus.
