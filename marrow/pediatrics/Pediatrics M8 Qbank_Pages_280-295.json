      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Most of the outbreaks of paralytic polio are caused by the type 1 virus.Three antigenically distinct serotypes (types 1, 2, and 3) of poliovirus are known. Poliovirus type 1has historically been the predominant cause of poliomyelitis worldwide and continues to betransmitted in endemic areas.Most infections with poliovirus are asymptomatic. Rarely, patients can have the followingpresentations:• Abortive poliomyelitis - a minor illness, manifested by fever, malaise, sore throat, or headache.• Non-paralytic poliomyelitis - manifested by aseptic meningitis.• Paralytic poliomyelitis - aseptic meningitis followed by severe back, neck, and muscle pain withrapid/gradual onset of motor weakness. It is the least common presentation of poliovirusinfection.Wild poliovirus type 2 was eradicated in 1999. Until 2015, over 90% of cVDPV (circulatingvaccine-derived polioviruses) cases were due to the type 2 component in OPV.Bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains serotypes 1 and 3. Serotype 2 has been removed, as it isimplicated in the pathogenesis of cVDPV and occasionally vaccine-associated paralytic polio(VAPP).Note:On 25 April 2016, India switched from trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) to bivalent OPV; this dayis called the National switch day.",

Usually,the head will also raise, but in the case of poliomyelitis, the head drops backward.",

So, in order to walk, the personhas to prevent the buckling of the knee by supporting with the hand, producing a hand-knee gait.Examination findings in paralytic polio:A. In the early stage•Asymmetric motor paralysis - involvement of affected muscles is haphazard. No associatedsensory loss.•Commonly affects the lower limbs• Most common muscle affected - Quadriceps, although it is most often partially paralyzed.Most common muscle to undergo complete paralysis - Tibialis anterior•The most affected muscle in the hand - Opponens pollicis• Bulbar/bulbospinal polio - It is a rare but life-threatening disease affecting the motor neurons ofthe medulla and resulting in the involvement of the respiratory and cardiovascular centers, whichmay cause death.B.

Formula-fed infants in resource-limitedcountries should receive ZDV bid or NVP qd for 6 weeks.• Elective cesarean section*• Breastfeeding: Usually contraindicated, except in developing countries where breastfeeding maybe continued for 6 months.*Note:Maternal cART is documented to decrease the rate of perinatal HIV-1 transmission to &lt;2%, and&lt;1% if the mother's viral RNA level is &lt;1,000 copies/mL at delivery. Thus, elective C-sectionat 38 weeks of gestation should be considered only for women whose viral load is &gt;1,000copies/mL in late gestation, to further reduce the risk of vertical transmission.Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral drugs during C-section are as follows:• For elective (planned) C-section, ART should be given prior to the operation.•Women on lifelong ART should continue their standard ART regimen.• In case of emergency C-section in pregnant women who are not on ART, the three-drug regimenshould be started before the surgery and continued thereafter.291",
