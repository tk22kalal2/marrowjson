      "explanation": "Exclusively breastfed infants are least likely to have evening colic. The incidence of diarrhea, allergy to bovine milk, and atopic eczema are least reported in exclusively breastfed infants. Option A: Vitamin K content of milk is low and may contribute to hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Option B: Breast milk contains inhibitors of glucuronyl transferase and enhances absorption of bilirubin from the gut. This leads to the development of breast milk jaundice. Option C: During the first few days, the breastfed infant has a black-green colored stool. It changes to golden yellow by the end of the first week.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The correct answer is 2 and 5 only. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated if the mother has hepatitis B infection or if she is a chronic smoker. Infants born to an HbsAg positive mother routinely receive hepatitis B immunoglobulin and hepatitis B vaccine. So, a delay in the initiation of breastfeeding is not required. Alcohol consumption and smoking are NOT contraindications of breastfeeding. However, smoking and alcohol consumption should be discouraged. Note: In a mother with untreated, active tuberculosis: Temporarily withhold breastfeeding but can feed with expressed breastmilk. Resume breastfeeding once she has been adequately treated for 2 weeks and is no longer contagious. Contraindications of breastfeeding: Do not Breastfeed; Do not give expressed breastmilk; Do not Breastfeed (Temporarily); Do not give expressed breastmilk (Temporarily); Do not Breastfeed (Temporarily); Can give expressed breastmilk. Infant factors: Classic galactosemia. Maternal factors: Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) infection, Ebola virus infection, PCP/cocaine abuse.

Insufficient milk intake may be caused by insufficient milk production, failure of established breastfeeding, and health conditions in the infant that prevent proper breast stimulation. Breastfed neonates usually feed 8-12 times a day, with a minimum of 8 times per day. However, the neonate should be breastfed only on demand.",

The high fraction of solublewhey protein in breast milk makes it easily digestible.The predominant whey protein is α-lactalbumin in human milk and ß-globulin in cow milk.Human milk contains amino acids like taurine and cysteine (lacking in cow's milk), which arenecessary for neurotransmission and neuromodulation.Breast milk is rich in polyunsaturated fat (not saturated fat), which is necessary formyelination. Human breast milk is generally rich in oleic acid and linoleic acid.Sodium concentration is not high in breast milk.

It has a risk of aspiration and is a slower method offeeding.Feeding tubes- orogastric or nasogastric tubes are an efficient way of measuring intake. It isoptimally used in very preterm infants with no suck-swallow-breathe coordination for long-termuse.
