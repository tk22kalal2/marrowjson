Each mole of benzoate removes 1mole of ammonia as glycine.Phenylacetate conjugates with glutamine to form phenylacetylglutamine, which is readily excretedin the urine. One mole of phenylacetate removes 2 moles of ammonia as glutamine from the body.Arginine administration supplies the urea cycle with ornithine. It is effective in all patients, exceptthose with arginase deficiency.Note:Phenylbutyrate which is metabolized to phenylacetate in our body can also be used as it scavengesnitrogen.",

      "explanation": "This clinical vignette is strongly suggestive of I-cell disease or inclusion cell disease. It is alsoknown as type II Mucolipidosis.It is an autosomal recessive inherited as a lysosomal storage disorder. It is caused due to a defectin N-acetylglucosaminyl-1-phosphotransferase required for the Golgi to phosphorylate mannoseresidues on glycoproteins. This leads to defective mannose-6-phosphate, an important cellsignaling molecule required for trafficking of the lysosomal enzyme from the site of its productionin the endoplasmic reticulum to the lysosome. Due to this defect, the lysosomal enzymes aresecreted out of the cell and there is an increased serum concentration of the same. Intracellularly,there are abnormal inclusion bodies and vacuolizations, thus earning the disease its name.Clinically, these patients present with symptoms either at birth or early in life with growthretardation, failure to thrive, delay of developmental milestones, coarse facial features with acloudy cornea and gingival hypertrophy, and other non-specific findings such as hip dislocations,inguinal hernias, hepatomegaly, joint limitation, and skin changes.Investigations to establish a diagnosis may includemeasuring N-acetylglucosaminyl-1-phosphotransferase activity in WBCs or in cultured fibroblastsand estimating serum levels of lysosomal enzymes.Option B: Galactosemia is caused due to the complete absence of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. The deficiency of this enzyme leads to an inability to convert galactose-1-phosphate(galactose-1-P) to uridine diphosphate galactose. It is characterized by typical clinical featuressuch as jaundice, vomiting, hepatomegaly, failure to thrive, poor feeding, lethargy, diarrhea,E.Coli sepsis. Infants may also have edema, ascites, full fontanelle, encephalopathy, and excessive272bruising and bleeding. They tend to develop cataracts due to the accumulation of galactitol.Option C: Adrenoleukodystrophy is an X-linked recessive disorder of ẞ-oxidation of fatty acids.There is a very large chain fatty acids buildup in the adrenal glands, the white matter of the brain,and testes. It is a progressive disease that can lead to adrenal gland crisis, coma, and death.Option D: Hurler syndrome is an important diagnosis in a patient presenting with clinical featuresgiven in this clinical vignette. But it is a mucopolysaccharidosis type 1-H caused due by the defectin the α-L Iduronidase leading to the accumulation of heparin sulfate and dermatan sulfate. It ischaracterized by skeletal abnormalities, hepatosplenomegaly, and severe intellectual disability.Infants develop characteristic coarse facial features, a wide nasal bridge, and a flattened midface.Features such as hepatosplenomegaly, umbilical or inguinal hernias, and typical skeletalabnormalities, known as dysostosis multiplex laos are also seen. They also have developmentaldelays and recurrent sinopulmonary diseases. Failure to thrive and growth restriction are alsoseen.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Aldolase B deficiency is likely in this child.In the given case scenario, the child becomes symptomatic after ingesting fruit juice that containsfructose; this indicates that she has hereditary fructose intolerance, which is caused by thedeficiency of aldolase B.Deficiency of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (Aldolase B hereditary fructoseintolerance): Fructose aldolase B is present in the liver, kidney, and intestine. It catalyzes thehydrolysis of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into triose phosphate and glyceraldehyde phosphate.Clinical features: Patients are asymptomatic until fructose or sucrose is ingested (usually fromfruit, fruit juice, sweetened cereal, or table sugar). Clinical features include jaundice,hepatomegaly, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, and convulsions. It resembles galactosemia. Acuteingestion causes symptomatic hypoglycemia. Chronic intake results in failure to thrive and hepaticdisease. The persistence of fructose intake can lead to liver failure, kidney failure, and death.Diagnosis: Reducing substance is seen in the urine during an episode (Benedict's test +). Anassay of fructaldolase B activity in the liver gives a definitive diagnosis.Treatment: Complete elimination of all sources of sucrose, fructose, and sorbitol from the diet.With age, symptoms become milder even after fructose ingestion. The long-term prognosis isgood.Note:The deficiency of fructokinase is not associated with any clinical manifestations. Fructosuria is anaccidental finding usually made because the asymptomatic patient's urine contains a reducingsubstance. No treatment is necessary, and the prognosis is excellent.",

      "question": "All of the above agents are used in the treatment of acute hyperammonemia in an infant.Treatment of acute hyperammonemia in an infant:••• Provide adequate calories, fluid, and electrolytes intravenously.• Minimal amounts of protein as a mixture of essential amino acids during the first 24 hours oftherapy.•Give priming doses of the following compounds: Sodium benzoate, Sodiumphenylacetate, Arginine hydrochloride.• Initiate peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis if the above treatment fails to produce an appreciabledecrease in plasma ammonia levels.Benzoate forms hippurate with endogenous glycine in the liver. Each mole of benzoate removes 1mole of ammonia as glycine.Phenylacetate conjugates with glutamine to form phenylacetylglutamine, which is readily excretedin the urine. One mole of phenylacetate removes 2 moles of ammonia as glutamine from the body.Arginine administration supplies the urea cycle with ornithine. It is effective in all patients, exceptthose with arginase deficiency.Note:Phenylbutyrate which is metabolized to phenylacetate in our body can also be used as it scavengesnitrogen.Solution to Question 3:Hyperuricemia is not a component of HHH syndromeHHH syndrome is a rare autosomal-recessive disorder caused by a defect in the transport systemof ornithine from the cytosol into the mitochondria (deficiency of ornithinepermease/translocase), resulting in the accumulation of ornithine in the cytosol leading tohyperornithinemia and a deficiency of this amino acid in mitochondria results in the disruption ofthe urea cycle and hyperammonemia. Homocitrulline is formed from the reaction ofmitochondrial carbamyl phosphate with lysine, which can become a substrate for the OTCreaction when ornithine is deficient.Components of HHH syndrome:•.HyperammonemiaHyperornithinemia• Homocitrullinemia270Solution to Question 4:The given pedigree chart shows X-linked dominant inheritance. X-linked protoporphyria isinherited in an X-linked dominant pattern.All porphyrias are autosomal dominant except the following:•Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) (autosomal recessive)• 8-Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase porphyria (ADP) (autosomal recessive)• Protoporphyria - X-linked protoporphyria (X-linked dominant).Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) (autosomal recessive)Solution to Question 5:Erythropoietic protoporphyria (autosomal recessive) is the most common porphyria to manifest inchildhood.Porphyria cutanea tarda (option",

        "B": "also known as Günther disease presents itself inutero or in infancy. It is a rare autosomal-recessive disease.Hereditary coproporphyria (option D) presents itself in the post-pubertal age.Solution to Question 6:8-Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase porphyria (ALAD) is also called plumboporphyria/Dossporphyria due to its clinical similarity to lead poisoning, although it is not related to leadexposure.ALAD catalyzes the condensation of 2 molecules of ALA to form the pyrrole porphobilinogen(PBG). The enzyme is subject to inhibition by lead because ALAD is the principal lead-bindingprotein in erythrocytes, and lead can displace the zinc atoms of the enzyme, thus inhibiting it.Therefore, both lead poisoning and ALAD porphyria produce similar signs andsymptoms. Symptoms resemble those of other acute porphyrias, including acute attacks ofabdominal pain and neuropathy.Solution to Question 7:The most likely diagnosis is acute intermittent porphyria which presents as a neurovisceralsyndrome with no cutaneous manifestations and no phototoxicity.Acute Intermittent Porphyria:• Autosomal dominant• Deficiency of the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase271• Presents at post-pubertal age• Present with hepatic and neurologic manifestations•Exacerbated by P450 inducing drugs like phenytoin, progesterone and dietary restrictionSolution to Question 8:Symptoms of cutaneous photosensitivity beginning in childhood and a substantially elevatedconcentration of total erythrocyte protoporphyrin supports a diagnosis of erythropoieticprotoporphyria. The enzyme deficient in erythropoietic protoporphyria is ferrochelatase (FECH).Symptoms consist of acute pain and itching often occurring within minutes of sunlight exposureand followed by redness and swelling with continued exposure. Swelling may resembleangioneurotic edema and solar urticaria. Symptoms are usually worse in the spring and summer.Chronic changes may include lichenification, leathery pseudovesicles, labial grooving, and nailchanges, but changes in pigmentation and pronounced scarring are unusual.Life-threatening protoporphyric hepatopathy is characterized by greater increases in erythrocyteand plasma protoporphyrin levels, increased photosensitivity, and either chronically abnormalliver function tests or rapidly progressive hepatic failure.Solution to Question 9:This clinical vignette is strongly suggestive of I-cell disease or inclusion cell disease. It is alsoknown as type II Mucolipidosis.It is an autosomal recessive inherited as a lysosomal storage disorder. It is caused due to a defectin N-acetylglucosaminyl-1-phosphotransferase required for the Golgi to phosphorylate mannoseresidues on glycoproteins. This leads to defective mannose-6-phosphate, an important cellsignaling molecule required for trafficking of the lysosomal enzyme from the site of its productionin the endoplasmic reticulum to the lysosome. Due to this defect, the lysosomal enzymes aresecreted out of the cell and there is an increased serum concentration of the same. Intracellularly,there are abnormal inclusion bodies and vacuolizations, thus earning the disease its name.Clinically, these patients present with symptoms either at birth or early in life with growthretardation, failure to thrive, delay of developmental milestones, coarse facial features with acloudy cornea and gingival hypertrophy, and other non-specific findings such as hip dislocations,inguinal hernias, hepatomegaly, joint limitation, and skin changes.Investigations to establish a diagnosis may includemeasuring N-acetylglucosaminyl-1-phosphotransferase activity in WBCs or in cultured fibroblastsand estimating serum levels of lysosomal enzymes.Option B: Galactosemia is caused due to the complete absence of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. The deficiency of this enzyme leads to an inability to convert galactose-1-phosphate(galactose-1-P) to uridine diphosphate galactose. It is characterized by typical clinical featuressuch as jaundice, vomiting, hepatomegaly, failure to thrive, poor feeding, lethargy, diarrhea,E.Coli sepsis. Infants may also have edema, ascites, full fontanelle, encephalopathy, and excessive272bruising and bleeding. They tend to develop cataracts due to the accumulation of galactitol.Option C: Adrenoleukodystrophy is an X-linked recessive disorder of ẞ-oxidation of fatty acids.There is a very large chain fatty acids buildup in the adrenal glands, the white matter of the brain,and testes. It is a progressive disease that can lead to adrenal gland crisis, coma, and death.Option D: Hurler syndrome is an important diagnosis in a patient presenting with clinical featuresgiven in this clinical vignette. But it is a mucopolysaccharidosis type 1-H caused due by the defectin the α-L Iduronidase leading to the accumulation of heparin sulfate and dermatan sulfate. It ischaracterized by skeletal abnormalities, hepatosplenomegaly, and severe intellectual disability.Infants develop characteristic coarse facial features, a wide nasal bridge, and a flattened midface.Features such as hepatosplenomegaly, umbilical or inguinal hernias, and typical skeletalabnormalities, known as dysostosis multiplex laos are also seen. They also have developmentaldelays and recurrent sinopulmonary diseases. Failure to thrive and growth restriction are alsoseen.Solution to Question 10:The given clinical scenario of bone pain, epistaxis, hepatosplenomegaly, and low levelsof ẞ-glucosidase suggests a diagnosis of Gaucher's disease that is inherited in an autosomalrecessive pattern.Gaucher's disease:••It is an inborn error of metabolism due to the deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase(ẞ-glucosidase) that leads to the accumulation of glucocerebroside in the lysosomes of cells.It is the most common lysosomal storage disorder.• The clinical features result from the accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages in the spleen,liver, bone marrow, bone, and other tissues.• There are 3 clinical subtypes, delineated by the absence or presence and progression ofneurologic manifestations: type 1, or the adult, nonneuronopathic form; type 2, the infantile oracute neuronopathic form; and type 3, the juvenile or subacute neuronopathic form• Typical clinical features include delayed puberty, painless hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, livercirrhosis, hypersplenism and pancytopenia, bleeding tendencies, bone pain due to avascularnecrosis, osteoporosis, pathological fractures.• Neurological symptoms such as developmental delay, hypertonia, strabismus, supranuclear gazepalsy (seen in type 3).•• Bone marrow examination usually reveals the presence of Gaucher cells (have acharacteristic wrinkled-paper appearance)• Enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher's disease: imiglucerase, velaglucerasealfa, taliglucerase alfa,eliglustatSolution to Question 11:273The clinical vignette along with the cherry-red spot on fundus examination suggests a diagnosis ofNiemann-Pick disease type A- Lysosomal storage disorder due to an inherited deficiency ofsphingomyelinaseType A is a severe infantile form with extensive neurologic involvement (hypotonia, milestoneregression, apathy), marked visceral accumulations of sphingomyelin (hepatosplenomegaly, foamyhepatocytes, zebra bodies on EM), and progressive wasting and early death within the first 3 yearsof life.In contrast, patients with Niemann-Pick disease type B have organomegaly but generally no CNSinvolvement.Solution to Question 12:The given clinical scenario of a child with coarse facies, macroglossia, thick lips,hepatosplenomegaly, and copious discharge from the nose is suggestive of Hurler's disease.It is the severe form of mucopolysaccharidoses type 1 (MPS 1), an autosomal recessive disordercaused by a defect in α-L iduronidase, leading to the accumulation of heparan sulfate anddermatan sulfate. The child usually presents between 6 and 24 months with hepatosplenomegaly,coarse facial features (shown below), corneal clouding, large tongue, prominent forehead, jointstiffness, short stature, and skeletal dysplasia.Most patients have recurrent upper respiratory tract and ear infections, noisy breathing, andpersistent copious nasal discharge. Radiograph shows skeletal dysplasia, called dysostosismultiplex - thick ribs, ovoid vertebral bodies, enlarged and trabeculated diaphyses of the longbones with irregular metaphysis and epiphysis.Macrocephaly, enlarged J-shaped sella, premature closure of lambdoid sagittal sutures, andshallow orbits are seen with disease progression. Obstructive airway disease, cardiaccomplications, and respiratory infections are the common causes of death.The image below shows the radiograph shows enlarged diaphyses of the metacarpal andphalanges.274Other options:Option B: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is an overgrowth syndrome characterized bymacrosomia, macroglossia, hemihypertrophy, omphalocele, and renal anomalies. It is associatedwith an increased risk of Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, andadrenal cortical carcinoma.Option C: Proteus syndrome is a disturbance of cellular growth involving ectodermal andmesodermal tissues, caused by mutation in the AKT1 gene. They present withhemimegalencephaly, asymmetric overgrowth of the extremities, verrucous cutaneous lesions,thickening of the bone, and excessive growth of muscles.Option D: A child with untreated congenital hypothyroidism may have stunted growth, shortextremities, narrow palpebral fissures, swollen eyelids, depressed nasal bridge, thick broadprotruded tongue, and short and thick neck, dry and scaly skin.Solution to Question 13:Enzyme replacement therapy is not available for Sanfilippo syndrome (MPS type III).Solution to Question 14:The muscle biopsy shows the presence of large vacuoles. This along with the clinical vignette isstrongly suggestive of Pompe's disease or type II glycogen storage disease. It is caused due to thedeficiency of the enzyme lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase.Clinically, the child presents with hypotonia, hepatomegaly, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Theaffected child usually dies around the age of 2 years due to heart failure.Investigations include chest X-ray imaging which shows cardiomegaly. The muscle biopsyshowing vacuoles further aids the diagnosis.Treatment includes enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant enzyme a-glucosidase alfa(Myozyme).Solution to Question 15:The clinical and laboratory features indicate Andersen's disease in the baby. Inability to gainweight, hepatosplenomegaly, muscle weakness, and accumulation of abnormal glycogenresembling amylopectin point towards the diagnosis.Andersen's disease is type IV glycogen storage disease. It is transmitted in an autosomal recessivepattern and occurs due to a deficiency of glycogen branching enzyme because of pathologicvariants in the GBE1 gene. This leads to accumulation of of an abnormal structure of glycogenknown as polyglucosan. It is characterized by275• Growth delay•••Hepatomegaly due to the accumulation of polysaccharides with few branch pointsMyopathyThere might be fasting intolerance and ketosis in the initial stages. Hypoglycemia usuallyappears late in the disease when it is associated with cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and ascites..• Biopsy of the liver will show the presence of abnormal glycogen which resembles amylopectin.Amylopectin is found in plants and has very few branches. Since there is a defect in the branchingof the glycogen, the abnormal glycogen appears like amylopectin.The diagnosis is confirmed by absent branching enzyme activity in skin fibroblasts, muscle, orliver and analysis of the DNA mutation.Von Gierke's disease (Option A) has features of lactic acidosis, hypoglycemia, hyperuricemia,impaired growth, and bone thinning. It occurs due to a defect in the glucose 6-phosphatase.McArdle disease (Option",
