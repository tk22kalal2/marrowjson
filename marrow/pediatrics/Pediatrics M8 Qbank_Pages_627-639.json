      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of a girl (46XX) with an enlarged clitoris is highly suggestiveof congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency.Congenital adrenal hyperplasia/adrenogenital syndrome is a family of autosomal-recessivedisorders caused by the deficiency of enzymes involved in the synthesis of steroid hormones inthe adrenal cortex. The majority of cases of CAH are caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Thisdeficiency leads to a lack of synthesis of cortisol and aldosterone, resulting in the salt-wastingform of the disease, which is the most severe form.Severe 21-hydroxylase deficiency presents with symptoms including weight loss, dehydration,weakness, hypotension, and electrolyte imbalances. Accumulated steroid precursors like63817-hydroxyprogesterone, are shunted into the pathway of androgen synthesis leading to elevatedlevels of androstenedione and testosterone. This can result in abnormal genital development inaffected female fetuses during early gestation.Females may have masculinized external genitalia. This can include enlargement of the clitoris,partial or complete labial fusion, and a shared opening of the vagina and urethra (urogenitalsinus).Untreated individuals develop signs of androgen excess after birth. These signs includeaccelerated skeletal maturation, premature epiphyseal closure leading to stunted adult stature,excessive muscular development, the appearance of pubic and axillary hair, acne, and deepeningof the voice. In males, enlargement of the penis, scrotum, and prostate. In females, the clitorismay become further enlarged.Diagnosis of confirmed by elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels. Glucocorticoid replacementwith hydrocortisone is done. In a salt-wasting crisis, fludrocortisone supplementation is given.Vaginoplasty and clitoral recession are done for females with ambiguous genitalia.639",
