Italso binds and protects the circulating factor VIII from rapid clearance in circulation.=Von Willebrand disease is mostly inherited as an autosomal dominant trait (rarely autosomalrecessive). The types of disease include quantitatively deficient vWF (partial = type 1 or absolute =type 3) or qualitatively abnormal vWF (type 2 = dysproteinemia). The majority (~ 80%) have type1 disease.Hemophilia A (factor 8 deficiency) occurs in 1 in 5,000 males. Hemophilia B (factor 9 deficiency)occurs in approximately 1 in 25,000 males.",

Evans syndrome is anautoimmune hemolytic disorder with thrombocytopenia. Von Willebrand's disease doesn't usuallymanifest at birth.Bernard-Soulier syndrome is an autosomal recessive functional/qualitative platelet disorder. It ischaracterized by the deficiency of Gp Ib-IX receptor causing defective platelet adhesion.

      "explanation": "The ristocetin-aggregation test is abnormal in both von Willebrand disease and Bernard-Souliersyndrome.All of the above diseases are inherited bleeding disorders affecting platelet function. Hence, thereis prolonged bleeding time but platelet levels are not significantly affected.Platelet aggregation tests use a panel of platelet agonists (adenosine diphosphate [ADP],epinephrine, collagen, and ristocetin) to measure platelet activation and aggregation in vitro.Ristocetin induces the binding of VWF to platelets and agglutinates platelets.Bernard-Soulier syndrome, a severe congenital platelet function disorder, is caused by an absenceor severe deficiency of the VWF receptor on the platelet membrane. Hence, in Bernard-Souliersyndrome, no response (or no aggregation) is seen with ristocetin.The ristocetin-aggregation test is also abnormal in von Willebrand disease.
