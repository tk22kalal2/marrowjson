      "explanation": "An element is a single observation in a study. For example, in a study of blood pressure values,the blood pressure value of one person is an element.In a statistical study, the population refers to the group about which information is to be gathered.The composition of the population in terms of its age, sex, occupation, cultural characters, etcneed to be defined before a study is conducted. The population need not consist of just people butcan also be made of measurements. For example, in a study of blood glucose measurements inIndians, the population consists of the blood glucose measurements.The part/subset of the population, which is being studied is known as a sample. For example, in aquestionnaire-based study on cervical cancer in a population, the sample would include femalesattending the out-patient departments of a hospital.

      "explanation": "If the probability of an event occurring is 1, it means there is an absolute certainty that the eventwill occur.The addition rule and multiplication rule can be used to calculate the probability of an event. Theaddition rule is used to calculate the combined probability of the occurrence of two or moremutually exclusive events. The multiplication rule is used to calculate the combined probability oftwo or more statistically independent events occurring together.Probability values range from o (no probability) to 1 (absolute certainty). So negative value of p isnot possible.Since p is the probability of an event occurring and q is the probability of the event not occurring,q=1-p",

      "explanation": "Binomial distribution is widely used in genetic counseling.Binomial distribution helps determine the probability of occurance of a specific combination ofmutually exclusive independent events. In a binomial distribution, there are only two possibleevents like Yes/No or Male/Female or Alive/Dead. The results of the distribution gives theprobabilities of obtaining an exact number of successes in a series of independent trials.For example, the inheritence of cystic fibrosis follows a binomial distribution. There are:a. Two possible events - inheriting the disease/ not inheriting itb. Events are mutually exclusive - one person cannot both have the disease and not have it796c. Independent possibilities - if one child has inherited it, this will not affect if the other child willinherit it.The physician using this technique can explain to the patients the probabilities of their childrensuffering from the disease.",

This satisfies thecondition for the multiplication rule of probability which states that the probability of two or morestatistically independent events all occurring together is equal to the product of their individualprobabilities.Thus, here the probability that all the 3 randomly selected people from the population would haveanemia = 0.2 X 0.2 X 0.2 = 0.008.",
