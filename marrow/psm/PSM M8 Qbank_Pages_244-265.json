Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe, dehydrating diarrhea in children aged <5 years globally. In developing countries, 75% of the children acquire their first rotavirus infection in the first 12 months. The universal occurrence of rotavirus infections shows that clean water supply and good hygiene are unlikely to have a substantial effect on virus transmission. In tropical areas, rotavirus diarrhea occurs throughout the year, increasing in frequency in drier, cooler climates. Transmission is through the feco-oral route, person-to-person contact, or indirectly through fomites. Infected individuals shed very high concentrations of the virus for many days in their stool and vomit.",

Here, the weight of the child is not specified. Hence, 400-700 ml of ORS at home is to be given in the first four hours according to the age of the child. The below table shows the amount of ORS to be given according to the age of the child. In addition to this, 50-100 ml extra fluid is given after each loose stool. After four hours, the baby is reassessed and the appropriate plan is selected again for the continuation of the treatment. The four rules of home treatment are: Give extra fluid, give zinc supplements (1 tablet per day for 14 days, dissolved in a small amount of ORS or breastmilk or clean water), continue breastfeeding, and counsel the mother to return if there is blood in stools and if the child is feeding poorly.",
