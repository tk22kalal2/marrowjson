This patient should be managed withliposomal amphotericin B.This condition causes fever with rigor and chills associated with splenomegaly and hepatomegaly.Though lymphadenopathy is common in most endemic regions, it is rare in India.It is diagnosed by ELISA, indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT), and rk39 whichdetects antibodies to Leishmania donovani.The treatment is as follows:•In most endemic regions:• Drug of choice - pentavalent antimonial (sodium stibogluconate or meglumine antimoniate)•If it fails or is unavailable - amphotericin B• In India and Mediterranian countries, the drug of choice is liposomal AmB.•Other drugs - paromomycin and miltefosineOption B: Fluconazole is an antifungal and is not useful in visceral leishmaniasisOption C: Linezolid is used in the treatment of MRSA and related infections.Option D: Bedaquiline is a newer anti-TB drug used in MDR-TB.",

The incubationperiod is 10 days to 2 years, whereas the extrinsic incubation period is 4 to 25 days. The followingconditions are caused by Leishmania:•• Visceral leishmaniasis or kala-azar – L. donovani• Cutaneous leishmaniasis or oriental sore - L. tropica• Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis - L. braziliensis• Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis - L. donovani297The image below is a microscopic image of the LD body.According to the NVBDCP, the management is as follows:• First-line - single-dose liposomal amphotericin B (10 mg/kg IV infusion)•Alternate - paromomycin + miltefosine for 10 daysMonotherapy with antimonials (sodium stibogluconate) is no longer recommended due toresistance and toxicity. Synthetic pyrethroid is used for indoor residual spraying in all theendemic areas.",
