      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Randomized controlled trials are considered the gold standard for proving causation because they minimize bias and ensure that the study groups are similar in all aspects except for the intervention being tested.",

      "question": "In a clinical trial to evaluate a drug, randomisation was done before starting the trial. What is the purpose behind this?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The two groups will be similar in prognostic factors",
        "B": "The clinician has no control over the allocation of participants in each group",

        "D": "The sample may be referenced to a known population"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The main purpose behind randomisation is to eliminate selection bias. In an RCT, participants are randomly assigned to a study group or a control group. It is done only after obtaining consent. It removes both known and unknown confounding factors. The heart of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is randomisation. This allows comparability between the study and the control population.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The dropouts from an RCT are included in the final analysis. This type of analysis is called intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. It ignores noncompliance, protocol change, withdrawal, cross-over, and anything that happens after randomization during analysis. The exclusion of dropouts may lead to the introduction of bias. Note: Per-protocol analysis is a comparison of treatment groups that include only those patients who completed the treatment originally allocated to them. Hence, comparability between the study and control group is limited and randomization is lost.",

        "D": "Per protocol analysis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "A cross-over study would be the best method to ensure comparability between the experimental and control group. In a cross-over study design, patients are randomly assigned to the study and control group, and then after a period of time, their groups are switched. Here, each patient serves as his/her own control, which allows for maximum comparability. In a concurrent parallel study design, comparisons are made between two randomly assigned groups and there is no switching of groups. This allows only for limited comparability between experimental and control groups. Quasi-experiments are studies that aim to evaluate interventions but that do not use randomization. The lack of randomization is the major weakness of quasi trials. The comparability in a quasi trial is limited. A per-protocol analysis is a comparison of treatment groups that include only those patients who completed the treatment originally allocated. Hence, comparability is limited.",

Purpose of Phase III: confirmation of the effectiveness of the drug in patients with the target disease, and monitoring of adverse reactions. Phase II involves therapeutic exploration, which is the evaluation of the efficacy of the drug and dose-ranging (determination of the optimum tolerated dose).",

Phase I trials are usually performed on healthy volunteers to check the safety and pharmacokinetic properties of a drug. The participants in this phase do not gain any direct health benefits from taking part.

      "explanation": "To test the given hypothesis that smokers are at a higher risk of developing lung carcinoma than those who have quit, the study design chosen is a cessation experiment. The outcomes of termination of a habit or removal of an agent considered to be causally related to a disease can be evaluated in a cessation experiment. It is a type of RCT and preventive trial. If the outcome is a significant reduction in disease, then the association of that habit or agent to the disease is strengthened. A trial of aetiological agents is an experimental epidemiological study to confirm or refute an aetiological hypothesis. Clinical trials, for the most part, have been concerned with evaluating therapeutic agents, mainly drugs. An uncontrolled trial is an example of a non-randomised trial where there is no control group for comparison.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Specificity is the most difficult criterion to establish in both chronic and acute diseases. This is because a single factor or cause can give rise to more than one disease. Also, most diseases are multifactorial in origin with no possibility of demonstrating a one-to-one relationship, which would indicate specificity.",
