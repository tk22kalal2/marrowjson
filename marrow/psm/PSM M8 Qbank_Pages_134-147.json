        "C": "Chronic carriers",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Chronic carriers are those who shed or excrete the organism for indefinite periods. Carriers are classified into chronic carriers and temporary carriers based on the duration. Organisms may be shed continuously or intermittently in chronic carriers. The duration of the carrier state also depends on the disease. Chronic carrier state is seen in typhoid, hepatitis B, gonorrhea, malaria, etc. Temporary carriers are classified into: • Incubatory carriers - Those that shed the organism during the incubation period of the disease, especially during the later parts of it. It is seen in measles, mumps, polio, etc. • Healthy carriers - Those who suffer from subclinical infections and develop a carrier state without developing the overt disease. It is seen in polio, meningococcal meningitis, cholera, diphtheria, etc. • Convalescent carriers - Those that shed the organism during recovery or convalescence. It is seen in typhoid. Paradoxical carrier refers to a carrier who acquires the pathogen from another carrier. Note: Pseudo-carriers are carriers of avirulent organisms.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Tetanus does not show vertical or transplacental transmission. Transmission of diseases or non-infectious agents transplacentally is called vertical transmission. Diseases that show this type of transmission include: Herpes, HIV, Rubella, and Varicella. Apart from diseases, non-infectious agents like lithium, thalidomide, and stilbestrol can cross the placenta and lead to the development of congenital anomalies in a fetus. Note: Neonatal tetanus occurs as a result of the failure to use aseptic techniques in managing the umbilical stump, unclean hands, and instruments or contamination by dirt, straw, or other non-sterile materials in the delivery field. Immunization of pregnant women can prevent this disease via the transplacental transport of immunoglobulins.",

        "A": "All droplets can travel only as far as 3 feet",
        "B": "Droplets are usually larger than 5 microns",

        "D": "Basic ventilation decreases the potential for this type of transmission"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Droplet nuclei can travel as far as 6 feet, whereas a droplet (particle > 5µm) travels <30-60cm, as recent studies have shown. Droplets are a mode of direct transmission of infectious agents. They are formed from saliva and nasopharyngeal secretions released during coughing, sneezing, or speaking into the surrounding atmosphere. The expelled droplets may impinge directly upon the conjunctiva, oro-respiratory mucosa or skin of close contact. This mode of transmission is seen in the common cold, diphtheria, etc. Proper basic ventilation and prevention of overcrowding reduce the potential for this type of transmission.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Droplet nuclei are sized less than or equal to 5 microns. They may be formed by evaporation of droplets coughed or sneezed into the air or be generated purposefully by a variety of atomizing devices (aerosols). They are capable of indirect airborne transmission of diseases like tuberculosis, influenza, chickenpox, measles, etc. The droplet nuclei may remain airborne for long periods of time, some retaining and others losing infectivity or virulence. These small particles, when inhaled, are capable of reaching the alveoli and getting retained there.",

        "C": "Droplet nuclei",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Airborne transmission by droplet nuclei is not a method of direct transmission of diseases. It is a method of indirect transmission of diseases. Droplet nuclei are tiny particles of a size 1-5 microns range that may be formed by either the evaporation of droplets coughed or sneezed into the air or are formed from aerosols. These droplet nuclei remain airborne for long periods of time and can transmit diseases like tuberculosis, influenza, chickenpox, measles, Q fever, and other respiratory infections. Droplet transmission, vertical transmission, and contact with soil are methods of direct transmission of diseases. Differences between droplet and droplet nuclei are summarized below: DROPLET NUCLEI - Indirect transmission. It is the residue from evaporated droplets <5 microns in diameter. No need for close contact for transmission. Diseases transmitted: chickenpox, measles, etc. DROPLET - Direct transmission. It is produced while coughing, sneezing, talking ≥5 microns in diameter. Requires closeness and direct contact for transmission. Diseases transmitted: diphtheria, meningococcal meningitis, etc.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The spread of a disease through contaminated food is an example of vehicle-borne transmission. It is an indirect mode of transmission. Vehicle-borne transmission is the transmission of infectious agents through food, water, and biological products (blood, plasma, etc.). Of these, food and water are more frequent vehicles of transmission because they are used by everyone. Mother-to-child transmission, droplet infection, and transmission via dog bite are examples of direct modes of transmission.",

        "D": "Routine disinfection can prevent such transmission"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Fomites are objects other than water or food that can be contaminated by infectious agents and help in transmitting the disease. They include clothes, towels, linen, cups, plates, spoons, etc. Fomites are an example of an indirect mode of transmission. Some diseases transmitted by fomites include diphtheria, typhoid, hepatitis A, etc. Good public and personal hygiene can prevent this type of transmission.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The lodgement and development of an arthropod on the body surface is called infestation. Infection is the entry and development or multiplication of an infectious agent in a host's body. Contamination is the presence of a disease agent on a body surface like clothes, toys, etc., and also in substances like food or water. Colonization is the presence of a disease agent in or on a host, with growth and multiplication but without any overt clinical expression or detected immune response in the host at the time it is isolated.",

      "explanation": "In the given scenario, the patient most likely has lymphatic filariasis. The causative organism of this disease (Wuchereria bancrofti) undergoes cyclo-developmental transmission. Cyclo-developmental transmission is a transmission where the agent undergoes only developmental changes and not multiplication within the vector. DEC provocation test: In this test, a small dose of DEC is given 20-50 minutes before sample collection so that the microfilaria appears in the blood even during the daytime.",

An area is declared free of an epidemic when there are no cases reported for twice the incubation period of the disease since the last case. The incubation period of typhoid is 14 days.

The secondary attack rate (SAR) is given by: (Number of exposed or susceptible persons developing the disease within the incubation period x 100) / (Total number of close or exposed contacts that are susceptible). Here, the number who developed the disease after exposure = 26. Susceptible population = 100 - 60 (vaccinated) - 1 (primary case) = 39. Therefore, SAR = 26/39 x 100 = 66%.
