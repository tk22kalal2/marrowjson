Patients also present with patchydepigmentation on the legs called leopard skin.The presence of microfilaria in the eye causes photophobia and gradual loss of vision. The mostsevere manifestations are sclerosing keratitis and chorioretinitis which can lead to blindness.Blackfly is also called Simulium. It has a flight range of almost 100 miles, making control of adultflies difficult. Abate is widely used as a larvicidal insecticide. The image given below shows ablackfly.636",
