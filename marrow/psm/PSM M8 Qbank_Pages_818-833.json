      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In a normal distribution, 50% of the values lie below the mean.In this scenario, 50%, i.e., 50 of the 100 people will have a systolic BP of less than 120 mmHg.",

Since the mean = 200 and the standard deviation= 20:68% of population will lie between Mean +/- 1SD, that is, 200 +/- 20 = 180-22095% of population lies between Mean+/-2SD, 200+/- 2*20 = 160-24099% of population lies between Mean+/-3SD, 200+/- 3*20 = 140-260833",
