Moreover, itmay be masked by widespread iron deficiency. It is, for this reason, iron and folatesupplementation is carried out in national programmes.Clinical vitamin B12 deficiency is not commonly encountered, but subclinical cases might be seenin up to 30% of adults and children due to widespread restriction to consumption of vegetarianproducts only.
