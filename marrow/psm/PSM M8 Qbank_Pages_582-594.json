      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Ventilation provided by wind blowing through a space is called perflation.Ventilation can be broadly classified as natural and mechanical:Natural ventilation includes:Perflation is the ventilation of a space achieved by allowing wind to blow through it andremoving the obstacles for this to happen (e.g., opening windows and doors).•Aspiration occurs when there is an obstruction as wind bypasses it and creates a suction action• Diffusion is the passage of air through small spaces or openings• Cross-ventilation is when air is allowed a natural path through the space by providing openingsat appropriate places, opposite each other.The drawback of natural ventilation is that regulation of air quality is not possible.Mechanical ventilation includes:• Exhaust ventilation utilizes exhaust fans placed high up near the roof on the external walls. Avacuum is created by which fresh air enters the ventilated space.•Plenum ventilation uses centrifugal fans to blow fresh air into the room and create a positivepressure, by which vitiated air is pushed out.586•Balanced ventilation is the combination of both exhaust and plenum methods of ventilation.• Air conditioning can be done through mechanical ventilation. It is the simultaneous control ofall or at least three factors that influence air quality in a confined room or space. These factorsinclude temperature, humidity, air movement, distribution, dust, bacteria, odours and toxic gases.",
