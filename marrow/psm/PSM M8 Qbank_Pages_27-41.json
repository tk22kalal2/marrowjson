      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The biomedical concept of disease is based on the germ theory of disease, which was postulated by Louis Pasteur. The germ theory of disease states that microorganisms known as pathogens or germs can lead to disease. It was criticized that it did not include environmental, social, psychological, and cultural determinants of health. The ecological concept of disease states that disease is the maladjustment of the human organism to the environment. The psychosocial concept of disease hypothesizes that health is also influenced by social, psychological, cultural, and economic factors as well. The holistic concept of disease includes all the above concepts to describe health.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Number of days of restricted activity is a disability indicator. Morbidity is defined as public health outcomes focusing on diseases, traumas, or injury. Morbidity indicators can be used to measure the overall health and extent of healthcare utilisation in a given population. Disability is defined as public health outcomes related to health conditions that include limitations in personal activities and societal participation. There are two types of disability indicators as follows: Event type indicators - Number of days of restricted activity, Bed disability days, Work loss days (or school loss days) within a specified period. Person type indicators - Limitation of mobility: e.g. confined to bed, Limitation of activity: e.g. limitation to perform the basic activities of daily living such as eating and going to the toilet.",

        "C": "HALE",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "HALE (Health Adjusted Life Expectancy) is an indicator that can be used to estimate the number of years a newborn is expected to live in full health based on the current rates of ill health and mortality. HALE is calculated using the life expectancy at birth with an adjustment for time spent in poor health. It captures both fatal and non-fatal health outcomes of average levels of population health. It is also sensitive to changes over time or differences between countries in the distribution of health states. Sullivan's index is also known as disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) or active life expectancy. It is the average number of years an individual is expected to live free of disability if the current patterns of mortality and disability continue to apply. It doesn't take into account premature death. As HALE includes not just disability but the larger definition of poor health, it is a better option with respect to the question.",

      "question": "While assessing the health needs of a community, an epidemiologist is tasked with estimating the burden of cholera in the area. Which of the following is the simplest measure he can use?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Case fatality rate",
        "B": "Incidence",
        "C": "Crude death rate",
        "D": "Proportional mortality rate"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The proportional mortality rate is the simplest measure of estimating the burden of disease in the community. It signifies the proportion of all deaths that can be attributed to the disease. It is calculated as follows: Proportional mortality rate of a disease = (Number of deaths due to that disease in the year / Total number of deaths in the year) * 100. Option A: Case fatality rate measures the risk of persons dying from a certain disease within a given time period. It measures the killing power of a disease. It is used to link mortality to morbidity. Option B: Incidence measures the rate at which new cases are occurring in a population. It is not influenced by the duration of the disease. The use of incidence is generally restricted to acute diseases. Option C: Crude death rate is considered a fair indicator of the comparative health of the people. It is the rate of total deaths in a year compared to the mid-year population.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Disability-adjusted life years (DALY) is the best measure of the overall burden of a disease in a defined population. It is also the best measure of the effectiveness of interventions. DALY is calculated as - Years of lost life prematurely (YLL) + Years lost to disability (YLD). It can measure both mortality and disability together. As DALY is affected by premature loss of life, conditions that affect younger individuals, like road traffic accidents, have a high DALY. In comparison to this, Alzheimer's disease has a lower DALY as it is a disease that mostly develops during old age and so has a lower YLL.",

      "explanation": "Bed disability days is not a utilisation rate. It is an event-type disability indicator. It is defined as the number of days a person spent in a hospital bed due to illness or injury. Health utilisation rate is defined as the number of people making use of the available health services to the total number of individuals in that population. Health utilisation rates include: Proportion of infants immunized against diseases in the expanded program on immunization (EPI), Proportion of women receiving antenatal care and supervised delivery, Percentage of population using family planning methods, Bed occupancy rate, Average length of stay in the hospital, and Bed turnover ratio.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Infant mortality rate (IMR) is the best indicator of the availability, utilization, and effectiveness of health care. It is a very sensitive indicator. Infant mortality rate (IMR) = Number of deaths in the first year of life/Number of live births x 1000. It is also one of the best indicators of state failure. It is the most universally accepted health status indicator of the whole population and of the socio-economic status in which they live.

      "explanation": "Lifestyle is a behavioural and socio-cultural determinant of health. It is not a socio-economic determinant. Socio-economic determinants of health are the following: Economic status (per capita GNP), Education, Occupation, and Political system. Lifestyle is simply the way people live. It reflects our social values, attitudes, and activities. It is composed of: Cultural patterns (daily nutrition, superstitions), Behavioral patterns (personal hygiene, sedentary life), and Lifelong personal habits (e.g., smoking, alcoholism). Lifestyle is learned by social interaction with parents, siblings, friends, school, and mass media. Our political system determines our health. It can help shape community health services with regards to resource allocation, manpower policy, choice of technology, and the degree to which these services are made available and accessible to all segments of the society. The percentage of GDP spent on health is an indicator of political commitment. WHO recommends at least 5% of GDP to be spent on healthcare. India spends about 2.1% of its GDP on health (budget 2022-23).",

        "D": "It includes the provision of free health camps by the government"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The provision of free health camps by the government is a concept of state medicine. Health does not merely mean the absence of disease or the provision of diagnostic, curative, and preventive services. It is a state of physical, mental, and social well-being. The state of positive health is based on the idea of perfect functioning of the body and mind. According to this concept, health is: • Biologically a state in which every cell and organ in the body is functioning at optimum capacity • Psychologically a state in which the individual feels a sense of perfect well-being and mastery over his environment. • Socially a state in which the individual's capacities for participation in the social system are optimal. This concept is too idealistic and can never become a reality. Humans can never be so perfectly adapted to the environment because everything in our life is subject to change. As the goal of positive health is unattainable, a broader concept of improving the quality of life has emerged. This highlights that positive health depends on medical action and also on economic, cultural, and social factors in the community.",
