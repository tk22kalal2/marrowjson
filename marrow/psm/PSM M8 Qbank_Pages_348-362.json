They are used to detect the species of parasite.Microscopy is the best method for the diagnosis of malaria due to its high sensitivity andspecificity. Jaswant Singh Battacharya (JSB) stain is used for staining both thick and thin smears.Thick smear is used to detect infection and estimate parasite concentration. The correct thicknessis the thickness through which a newsprint is barely visible. It is prepared by slow-drying for 30minutes, which leads to hemolysis and distortion of the plasmodia morphology. Hence, speciescannot be detected.Thin smear is used to identify the particular infecting species of Plasmodium. It is prepared by airdrying for 10 minutes and fixed in methanol. Thus, the plasmodia morphology is not distorted.ATHINSMEARBTHICKSMEAR357",
