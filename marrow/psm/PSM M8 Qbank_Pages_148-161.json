      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Live vaccines should generally be avoided for 12 weeks following an injection of normal human immunoglobulin (Ig). If a live vaccine has already been administered, the injection of normal human Ig should be delayed for 2 weeks. NHIG is an antibody-rich fraction that is usually obtained from a pool of at least 1,000 donors. An NHIG preparation must contain at least 90% intact IgG and minimal IgG aggregates with a low IgA concentration. NHIG is commonly used to prevent measles and hepatitis A infections. Specific human immunoglobulins are made from the plasma of patients who have recently recovered from an infection or are obtained from individuals who have been immunized against a specific infection. These preparations have a high antibody content against an individual infection and provide immediate protection.",

        "D": "Production of antibody is slower"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Production of antibodies is faster in secondary booster response. Primary response is the immune response developed when an antigen is administered for the first time to a person who has never been exposed to it. There is a latent period of 3-10 days before antibodies appear in the blood. Secondary booster response is the immune response elicited by a booster dose. In comparison to a primary immune response, it has a shorter latent period, faster production of antibodies, and an abundance of antibodies. The antibody response is maintained at higher levels for a longer period of time, and the antibody elicited tends to have a greater avidity or capacity to bind to the antigen.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Simultaneous administration of two live vaccines should be done in the same syringe",
        "B": "Two live vaccines can be administered simultaneously",
        "C": "An immunocompromised state poses a contraindication to live vaccines",
        "D": "Live vaccines contain both major and minor antigens"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Simultaneous administration of vaccines is defined as administering more than one vaccine on the same clinic day, at different anatomic sites. They are not combined in the same syringe. Simultaneous administration of the most widely used live and inactivated vaccines does not result in decreased antibody responses or increased rates of adverse reactions. However, in children with functional or anatomic asplenia, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and Menactra brand meningococcal conjugate vaccines should not be administered at the same visit; these vaccines should be separated by at least 4 weeks. The advantages of simultaneous administration of vaccines include: the organisms multiply in the host and thus, the antigenic dose is larger than what is injected. They have all the major and minor antigenic components. Live vaccines should not be administered to those with an immunocompromised state, since they may cause severe systemic disease by way of viremia or bacteremia. Note: If live vaccines are not given simultaneously, they must be spaced as follows - the administration of two live parenteral vaccines or live intranasal influenza vaccines must be separated by at least 4 weeks. If two live vaccines are given less than 4 weeks apart, the second vaccine should be repeated in four weeks. This is because the live vaccine given first can interfere with the second vaccine, and the person may not develop active immunity to the second vaccine.",

        "C": "Reaction to previous dose",
        "D": "Pregnancy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The only absolute contraindication to administration of an inactivated or killed vaccine is a severe local or general reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine. Inactivated or killed vaccines are made from growing cultures of the organism and then inactivating them with heat or chemicals. They activate the channels of active immunity after injection and are less efficacious than live vaccines. Multiple doses or booster doses are usually required to produce an adequate antibody response. Killed vaccines can be given to immune-compromised individuals and in pregnancy as the infectious agent is inactivated and cannot grow. Egg allergy is not an absolute contraindication to the administration of an inactivated or killed vaccine.",

        "C": "8 weeks",
        "D": "12 weeks"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The minimum interval between the administration of two live vaccines is 4 weeks. This is because decreasing the interval between two doses may interfere with the antibody response and protection. Thus, live vaccines can either be given on the same day according to the schedule or 4 weeks apart. Note: In Park 27th ed., the minimum interval between two live vaccines is given as 3 weeks. However, several other standard sources, including CDC and UNDP, suggested an interval of 4 weeks. When both are given in options, it is recommended to mark 4 weeks as the correct answer.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Active and passive immunization should not be done together for measles as the vaccine used is a live vaccine. Live vaccines should generally be avoided for 12 weeks following an injection of normal human immunoglobulin (Ig). If a live vaccine has already been administered, the injection of normal human Ig should be delayed for 2 weeks. Note: In the case of measles alone, the recommended interval between administration of Measles immunoglobulins and Live measles vaccine is about 6 months in a non-immunocompromised individual and 8 months in an immunocompromised individual.",

        "D": "The rate of adverse reactions is very high"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Polysaccharide-based vaccines stimulate an antibody response against the surface polysaccharide of the pathogenic-capsulated bacteria. The polysaccharide structure varies not only between bacteria of different species but also between different strains within a single species. Thus, a limitation of these vaccines is that the immune responses are serotype-specific. If these vaccines are conjugated with proteins, they are given the capability of eliciting a stronger immune response. Multivalent formulations of both polysaccharide-based vaccines and conjugated vaccines are required to achieve protection against multiple serotypes.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "BCG vaccine must not be administered to HIV-infected infants who are symptomatic, despite the presence of high TB prevalence. Since BCG is a live vaccine, it significantly increases the risk of disseminated TB in a symptomatic HIV+ infant. However, asymptomatic infants who are HIV+ can be given BCG, provided the risk of contracting TB is high in that region. In areas of low TB prevalence or risk, the BCG vaccine is avoided. BCG vaccination in HIV: Newborn HIV-negative/status unknown - Give BCG, Asymptomatic, High TB prevalence area - Give BCG, Low TB prevalence area - Do not give BCG. WHO recommendations for administering live vaccines in symptomatic HIV+ patients: Measles vaccine (or MMR) is allowed even in the symptomatic stage of HIV infection (except in the terminal phase), so as to prevent serious and life-threatening wild measles virus disease. Avoid MMR only if CD4+ < 15% (severely immunocompromised). IPV is an inactivated vaccine and must be used as an alternative to OPV.",

Side effects most commonly seen include ulceration at the vaccination site and regional lymphadenitis. Some vaccine strains may also rarely cause osteomyelitis.

The DPT vaccine is made up of diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus vaccines. The pertussis component in DPT vaccine enhances the potency of the diphtheria toxoid. Both whole-cell killed B. pertussis and acellular pertussis component have this adjuvant effect. The only difference is that whole-cell killed B. pertussis is encephalitogenic and immunity is short-lasting, while the acellular pertussis component (DTaP) is devoid of neurological complications. There are two types of DPT vaccines - plain and adsorbed. Adsorption is usually carried out on a mineral carrier like aluminium phosphate or hydroxide.
