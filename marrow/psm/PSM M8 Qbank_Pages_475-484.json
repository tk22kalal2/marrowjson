      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "This man requires 50 g/day of high-quality protein.High-quality protein refers to proteins containing all the essential amino acids. According tothe FAO/WHO 2007 guidelines, the recommended high-quality protein intake for adult men andwomen is 0.83 g/kg/day. This man weighs 60 kgs. Hence he requires around 50 g (0.83*60 = 49.8)of high-quality protein per day.Recommended high-quality protein intake by FAO/WHO:However, the mixed Indian diet does not meet the requirement for high-quality protein. Hence,the protein requirement in Indian adults (men and women) is 1g/kg/day of mixed Indian dietprotein according to the ICMR 2010 guidelines.AgeProtein in g/kg/day1-5 years0.946-10 years0.91Adolescent male0.88Adolescent fem0.86ale480AgeProtein in g/kg/dayAdult man/wom0.83an",

Total protein digestibilitydoes not always reflect the digestibility of individual dietary indispensable amino acids. Hence,DIAAS has replaced the PDCAAS (protein digestibility corrected amino acid score) as thepreferred index for the evaluation of protein quality.",
