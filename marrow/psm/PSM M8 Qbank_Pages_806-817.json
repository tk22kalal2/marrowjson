      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The mean can be worked out only for quantitative values. Thus, it can be calculated for intervalor ratio scale data.A dichotomous scale is a type of nominal scale data that can take only two values. Example: Male/Female. For nominal scale data, the preferred measure of central tendency is mode. For ordinalscale data, both median and mode can be calculated.Median can be derived from ordinal, interval and ratio data scales. Mode can be derived from allscales of data- nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio.",

      "explanation": "The 50th centile can be obtained when values are arranged in order and the central value ispicked out. This is the same as the median.In a distribution that has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle value.812In a distribution that has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the middlevalues, i.e., the arithmetic mean of the two middle values.An example of how to calculate the median of an odd and an even number of elements is givenbelow.1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9Median = 61, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 91,2,3,6,8,9Median =(4+5) ÷ 2= 4.5Option C: Geometric mean is obtained by taking the arithmetic mean of values on a logarithmicscale.Option D: Mean deviation is a measure of dispersion. The average of deviations from thearithmetic mean gives the mean deviation.",

      "explanation": "The mode of a given sample can have more than one value. It is the most frequently occurringvalue in a distribution.For example, in the sample [1, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 12, 12, 17], the most repeated value i.e., the modeis 6.For the list of data [1, 1, 2, 4, 4], the mode is 1 and 4. Therefore, the mode is not unique. Thisdataset may be said to be bimodal, while a set with more than two modes may be described asmultimodal.Median can have only one value, obtained by arranging values in order and then picking out thecentral value. In a sample with an even number of elements, median is obtained by taking theaverage of the middle 2 elements.Mean can only have a single value. The harmonic mean is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean ofthe reciprocals of the data values. The geometric mean is obtained by taking the arithmetic meanof values on a logarithmic scale.813",

      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "In this scenario, median is the preferred measure of central tendency as there are outliers.The value of 5000 is an outlier in the given set, i.e., an observed value which is very distant fromother observations in the distribution. This indicates the usage of median as the measure ofcentral tendency as it is not sensitive to extreme values, unlike the mean.By arranging the data in order: 100, 160, 190, 250, 260, 300, 320, 320, 350, 5000, we get themedian as (260 + 300)/2 = 280.Options A and B: Mean is the most affected by the presence of outliers. Mode is the least affectedby outliers but it is used mainly for measuring the central tendency of nominal data.Option D: Geometric mean can be used for datasets with extreme values but it is not used whenthe values can be zero or negative. In the given scenario, the number of malaria cases reported ina town can also have a zero value.",
