It is 70-80 times more effective than hypochlorite ions.Bleaching powder, also known as chlorinated lime (CaOCl2), has 33 per cent of chlorine in it.When chlorine is added to water, there is the formation of hydrochloric and hypochlorous acids.The hydrochloric acid is neutralized by the alkalinity of the water. The hypochlorous acid ionizesto form hydrogen ions and hypochlorite ions, as follows:H2O + Cl2 → HCl + HOCIHOCl → H + OC1",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Microfiltration is a lower-pressure membrane process used for the treatment of water. Membrane processes are employed in the large-scale treatment of water. They are classified as high-pressure processes and lower-pressure processes. High-pressure processes include: Reverse osmosis - Rejects monovalent ions and organic molecules of molecular weight > 50 daltons. It is most commonly used for desalination of brackish water and seawater. The membrane pore size is < 0.002 μm. Nanofiltration - Allows monovalent ions such as sodium or potassium to pass but rejects a high proportion of divalent ions like calcium and magnesium and some higher molecular weight organics. The membrane pore size ranges from 0.001 to 0.01 μm. Lower-pressure processes include: Ultrafiltration - Rejects organic molecules of molecular weight > 800 daltons. The membrane pore size ranges from 0.002 to 0.003 μm. Microfiltration - Rejects colloidal and suspended material. It does not separate molecules and is usually used before reverse osmosis. The membrane pore size ranges from 0.01 to 12 μm.",
