But we already know that the null hypothesis is true and we areforced to accept the alternative hypothesis even though it is false.When an alternative hypothesis is accepted even when it is false and the null hypothesis is true, itis called as a type I error or an alpha error or a false positive error.853",

Statistically, p-value &lt; 0.05 implies that thealternate hypothesis is true.In this scenario, we can consider:• Null hypothesis: Both the treatments are equally effective (in other terms, there is no differencebetween the effect of the two treatments).• Alternative hypothesis: New treatment is more effective than the usual treatment.As the p-value is 0.04, which is statistically significant (&lt;0.05), the null hypothesis is rejectedand the alternative hypothesis is accepted. Hence the new treatment is more effective than theusual treatment.855",
