      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Side effects are rare with the use of adjuvants in vaccines. Adjuvants are substances that are added to vaccines to enhance their immunogenicity by degree and/or duration. They help in the reduction of the amount of immunogen in vaccines or in the number of doses required to achieve immunity. Aluminium salts are the most commonly used adjuvants. Adjuvants are used in many vaccines like: Anthrax vaccine, Hep A vaccine, Hep B vaccine, Japanese encephalitis vaccine, DT and DTaP, HPV vaccine, and Pneumococcal vaccine.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The image shown in the question is of an ice-lined refrigerator (ILR). Dial or digital thermometers are used to record temperatures inside an ice-lined refrigerator. ILRs are the main method of vaccine storage in primary health centers. They are an important part of the cold chain and they maintain a temperature of 2 to 8 °C for the storage of vaccines. They have different temperature zones for different vaccines. The upper zone is for freeze-sensitive vaccines like cholera, Hep B, rotavirus (liquid), etc., while the lower zone is for heat-sensitive vaccines like OPV, measles, etc. All vaccines are kept in the basket provided with ILR. Vaccines like OPV, BCG, measles, and JE can be kept at the bottom of the basket, while DPT, TT, Hep B, IPV, and pentavalent vaccines and diluents are kept in the upper part of the basket.",
