These tubes are then incubated and examined after anappropriate period of time. The test is called presumptive because the reaction observed in thetube may occasionally be due to other organisms.The proportion of false-positive reactions obtained depends both on the bacterial flora of thewater under examination and the medium used. Lactose broth, or MacConkey's broth,with bromocresol purple as an indicator and a standardized concentration of bile salts incubatedbetween 35°C-37°C for 48 hours, seems to be the most suitable media for presumptive tests.",
