The degree of risk is directlyrelated to the number of cigarettes smoked per day. Several mechanisms have been suggested forthis:• Carbon monoxide induced atherogenesis• Nicotine stimulation of adrenergic drive• Lipid metabolism with fall in levels of HDLCigarettes also increase the risk of sudden death in patients with CHD who are below 50 years ofage. The risk of death from CHD decreases with the cessation of smoking. The risk declines quite328substantially within one year of stopping smoking and more gradually thereafter until, after 10-20 years, it is the same as that of non-smokers.Risk factors for coronary heart disease are:• Modifiable:••Cigarette smokingHigh blood pressure• Elevated serum cholesterol• Diabetes• Obesity•••Sedentary habitsStress• Non-modifiable:•Age• Sex•Family history• Genetic factors• Personality",
