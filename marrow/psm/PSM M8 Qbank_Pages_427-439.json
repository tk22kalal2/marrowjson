Therefore there are 30 pregnant females per 1000population.Step 2: Since the total population is 5000, the total no of pregnant females = 5000 x 30/1000150Step 3: Since some pregnancies may not result in live births (abortions and stillbirths), acorrection factor of 10% should be added to avoid the underestimation of the number ofpregnancies.
