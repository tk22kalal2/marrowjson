      "explanation": "The design given is of a case-control study. It proceeds from effect to cause and is done after the exposure and outcome have occurred. It tries to determine the possible exposure factors after a known disease incidence. This is the first approach to test causal hypotheses and uses controls to support or refute an inference. Retrospective or historical cohort study, on the other hand, tries to compare the risk of developing a disease to some already known exposure factors. Ex: risk of lung cancer in uranium miners, risk of angiosarcoma in persons exposed to polyvinyl chloride etc. Retrospective cohort studies are more economical and quicker than prospective cohort studies.",

A confounding factor is defined as one which is associated with both exposure and outcome and is distributed unequally in study and control groups. In this study to determine the role of alcohol in the etiology of esophageal cancer, smoking is considered as a confounding factor because: it is associated with the consumption of alcohol (exposure), and it is an independent risk factor for esophageal cancer (outcome). In these conditions, the effects of alcohol consumption can be determined only if the influence of smoking is neutralized by matching.",

      "question": "Detailed Explanations Cohort studies fall under non-experimental (observational) analytical studies. Classification of epidemiological studies: • Observational studies: allow nature to take its own course, the investigator measures but does not intervene. It is further classified into: • Descriptive studies: limited to describing the occurrence of a disease in a population. • Analytical studies: go further by analyzing the relationship between health status and other variables. It includes: • Ecological studies • Cross-sectional studies • Case-control studies • Cohort studies • Experimental studies or interventional studies: it involves an active attempt to change a disease determinant or the progress of a disease, and is similar in design to experiments in other sciences. • Randomized controlled trials • Field trials • Community trials Solution to Question 2: In ecological studies, the unit of observation is the population or community. Type of study Unit Ecological/ Correlational Population Cross-sectional/ Prevalence Individual Case-control/ Case reference Individual Cohort/ Follow up Individual Randomised Controlled Trials Patients Field Trial Healthy people Type of study Unit Community trial Community Solution to Question 3: The design given is of a case-control study. It proceeds from effect to cause and is done after the exposure and outcome have occurred. It tries to determine the possible exposure factors after a known disease incidence. This is the first approach to test causal hypotheses and uses controls to support or refute an inference. Retrospective or historical cohort study, on the other hand, tries to compare the risk of developing a disease to some already known exposure factors. Ex: risk of lung cancer in uranium miners, risk of angiosarcoma in persons exposed to polyvinyl chloride etc. Retrospective cohort studies are more economical and quicker than prospective cohort studies. Solution to Question 4: This is a case-control study. In this scenario, 500 patients constitute the cases and 300 people from the general population constitute the controls. The study is done from effect (lung cancer) to cause (smoking). Solution to Question 5: Incidence cannot be calculated from case-control studies. Incidence can be calculated from cohort studies, also known as longitudinal studies. Solution to Question 6: Siblings cannot be used as controls while studying genetic conditions because the outcome would be distorted due to their similarities. Controls in a case-control study: • Usually disease-free • Can be up to 4 times the number of cases in small studies. • In large studies, a 1:1 ratio of cases and controls can be sought • Sources: general population, hospitals, relatives (spouses and siblings), neighbors, or colleagues • Although, siblings cannot be used as controls for studies on genetic conditions Solution to Question 7: Hawthorne bias is not seen in case-control studies. This bias occurs when the subjects change their attitude/ actions while under observation. This distorts the results of the cohort or experimental studies. The biases that are seen in the case-control study are: • Confounding • Recall bias • Selection bias • Berkesonian bias • Interviewer's bias Solution to Question 8: Random errors are not causes of bias. Random error arises when a value of the sample measurement diverges, due to chance alone, from that of the true population value. They can never be completely eliminated. Sources of random errors are individual biological variations, sampling errors, and measurement errors. Systematic errors are also called biases. They are different from random errors. Solution to Question 9: Berkesonian bias occurs due to the different rates of hospital admission of people with different diseases. It is a type of selection bias termed after Joseph Berkeson who described it. Solution to Question 10: Recall bias can be eliminated in a prospective study. Recall bias is also called memory bias. It is widely seen in retrospective (case-control) studies as extensive history is taken from the participants. Solution to Question 11: In this scenario, cigarette smoking is related to both the outcome of esophageal cancer and consumption of alcohol. Thus, this is an example of a confounding factor. A confounding factor is defined as one which is associated with both exposure and outcome and is distributed unequally in study and control groups. In this study to determine the role of alcohol in the etiology of esophageal cancer, smoking is considered as a confounding factor because: • It is associated with the consumption of alcohol (exposure). • It is an independent risk factor for oesophageal cancer (outcome). In these conditions, the effects of alcohol consumption can be determined only if the influence of smoking is neutralized by matching. Solution to Question 12: A confounding factor is a factor that is associated with both exposure and diseases and is distributed unequally in study and control groups. It can be reduced by matching. For example, if the study is that a sedentary lifestyle can lead to coronary artery diseases, then age can act as a confounding factor as it is individually linked to both sedentary lifestyle and coronary artery diseases. Solution to Question 13: Deletion is not a method to reduce confounding. Methods to reduce confounding are: • At the time of designing the study: • Randomization • Matching • Restriction • At the time of analysis: • Stratification • Statistical modelings like regression analysis, multivariate analysis, and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method. Solution to Question 14: Matching helps only in removing the known confounding factors. Matching is the process by which controls are selected in a way that they are similar to cases in certain pertinent variables (e.g., age) that are known to influence the outcome of the disease. If not adequately matched for comparability, these variables could confound the results. Solution to Question 15: There is no type of matching called collective matching. Types of matching: • Group matching: It is also called frequency matching. It is done when a large stratum is used for study and a 1:1 ratio of cases and controls can be achieved. • Individual matching: It is also called matching by pairs. It can be done when the study is small and more controls can be selected for one case. Solution to Question 16: Odds ratio (OR), also known as cross-product ratio, is used to measure the strength of association between risk factor (asbestos exposure) and outcome (mesothelioma).",
