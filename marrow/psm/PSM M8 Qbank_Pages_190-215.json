      "explanation": "Lead time is the period between the first possible time of detection (point A) and the usual time of diagnosis (point C). Screening time is the time difference between the first point of diagnosis and the critical point of diagnosis. Diagnosis of a disease before the critical point has a good outcome and reduces the severity by reversing the disease process. Diagnosis beyond the critical point; treatment would be unsuccessful and/or permanent damage would have occurred. Screening must be done in conditions where there is a considerable time lag between the onset of disease and the usual time of diagnosis, that is, conditions with a long lead time. Generation time is defined as the interval of time between the onset of infection by a host and the maximal infectivity of that host.",

It can be curable if treated early; otherwise, it is fatal in half the cases. Early diagnosis and treatment before the critical point have a good outcome and reduce the severity by reversing the disease process.

Types of screening: • Multiphasic screening is the application of two or more screening tests in combination with a large number of people at one time. Example: Annual health checkups. • High-risk or selective screening is done on high-risk groups. Example: MRI screening of the breast done annually in 25-year-old women with BRCA 1, BRCA 2 mutations in a first-degree relative. • Mass screening is the screening of a whole or large population, like using a chest X-ray for TB screening in large populations.

      "explanation": "The given new screening test has low specificity. The test is positive in many patients who actually don't have the disease, i.e., high false positives. The false-positive rate is the number of false positives out of the total non-diseased. False-positive rate = 1 - Specificity. The false-positive rate is inversely proportional to specificity. Hence, the given test with high false positives will have low specificity. Positive predictive value (PPV) = TP / (TP + FP). It shows the positive predictive value (PPV) of the test decreases with an increase in false positives. An increase in the false-positive does not affect the prevalence of the disease. The prevalence of a disease depends on the incidence (I) and duration (D) of the disease. Prevalence = I x D.",
