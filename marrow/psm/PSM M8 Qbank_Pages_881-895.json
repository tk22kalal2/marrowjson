      "explanation": "890The design effect is used in cluster sampling to allow for design structure and correlation betweenclusters.The design effect (DEFF) is used to decide the sample size needed for cluster sampling. This isdone by calculating the difference in sampling variability to the variability expected with simplerandom sampling (SRS).It can more simply be stated as the actual sample size divided by the effective sample size (whatyou would expect if you were using SRS). For example, let's say you were using cluster sampling.A DEFF of 2 means the variance is twice as large as you would expect with SRS. It also means thatif you used cluster sampling, you'd have to use twice the sample size.",

Any association that has a 95% confidence interval range that includes thevalue of 1.0 is considered to be non-significant. The value of 1.0 in the range means that the twofactors may co-exist together but one is not causing the other to happen.Odds ratio (OR) is the key parameter in case-control studies to assess the strength of associationbetween the exposure and outcome. The interpretation of the odds ratio can be done as below:•OR &gt; 1 indicates a positive association. If both upper and lower limits of the 95% confidencelimits are also &gt;1, it suggests that the odds ratio is significant and the factor can be ascertainedas a risk factor.• OR = 1indicates no association.
