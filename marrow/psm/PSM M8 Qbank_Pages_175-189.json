      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The Rideal-Walker coefficient helps in assessing the power of a disinfectant relative to phenol. It assesses this by determining the phenol coefficient (PC). A PC value of > 1 indicates that it is more effective than phenol. The higher the number, the greater its effectiveness in comparison to phenol and vice versa. Traditional organisms used to test the power of the disinfectant include S. aureus and Salmonella enterica subtype typhi. Phenol coefficient = The dilution of test disinfectant which kills microorganisms in a given time ÷ The dilution of phenol which kills the microorganism in the same time under identical conditions. Other tests that are used for disinfectants are as follows: • Chick Martin test - modification of the Rideal-Walker test where disinfectants act in the presence of organic matter like feces or yeast to simulate natural conditions • Kelsey-Skyes test (capacity test) - tests the capacity of a disinfectant to retain its activity when used repeatedly. • In-use test - determines whether the chosen disinfectant is effective in actual hospital use. Joseph Lister first introduced phenol (carbolic acid) as an antiseptic to sterilize surgical instruments and clean wounds. Lister's work led to a reduction in postoperative infections and made surgery safer for patients, distinguishing him as the 'Father of Modern Surgery' and 'Father of Antiseptic Surgery'.",
