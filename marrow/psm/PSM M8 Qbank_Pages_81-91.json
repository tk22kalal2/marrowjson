      "explanation": "The given scenario is an example of a descriptive study. Descriptive studies are used to describe a disease of unknown etiology. These studies also led to the discovery of prions as the etiological agents of chronic degenerative neurological disorders (Kuru) in humans. This is also an example of a descriptive study. Types of epidemiological studies: - Observational studies allow nature to take its own course, the investigator measures but does not intervene. - Descriptive studies - limited to the description of the occurrence of a disease in a population. - Analytical studies - go further by analyzing the relationship between health status and other variables. - Ecological studies, Cross-sectional studies, Case-control studies, Cohort studies. Experimental studies or intervention studies involve an active attempt to change a disease determinant or the progress of a disease and are similar in design to experiments in other sciences. - Randomized controlled trials, Field trials, Community trials.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "An epidemiological hypothesis is a supposition or variable. It is arrived at from observation and needs to be tested. Descriptive studies primarily focus on the formulation of a hypothesis. Analytical studies, which include study designs like case-control and cohort, are used to test the formulated hypothesis. The hypothesis can subsequently be rejected or accepted. Experimental studies involve an intervention to provide scientific proof for etiological risk factors of diseases and to measure the efficiency of health services.",

      "explanation": "Longitudinal studies are useful to study the natural history of a disease. It is also used to identify risk factors, and to find the incidence rate. In longitudinal studies, observations are repeated in the same population over a prolonged period of time by follow-up examinations. Their disadvantage is that they are difficult to organize and take a very long time.",

Cross-sectional study is a type of observational study where a cross-section of a population is examined once at one point in time. It is more useful in studying chronic diseases than acute ones.

      "explanation": "Point source epidemics are caused not only due to infectious agents but also by environmental pollution and contamination of food. Point source epidemics belong to the common source type of epidemics. Exposure to disease agents is brief, so they are also called single exposure epidemics. All cases develop within one incubation period. In the epidemic curve, there is a sharp rise and fall as all cases are clustered within one incubation period.

      "question": "An outbreak of viral hepatitis A was reported from a town between June and September of a particular year. The peak of the outbreak occurred in July. What is this an example of?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Common source, multiple exposures",

        "C": "Propagated epidemic, single exposure",
        "D": "Propagated epidemic, multiple exposures"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "This outbreak of viral hepatitis A is an example of a common source, multiple exposure type of epidemic. The incubation period of hepatitis A is approximately 28 days (range 15 to 50 days). In this scenario, the cases of viral hepatitis A have occurred over a period from June to September (120 days) which is more than one incubation period of the disease. This is suggestive of multiple exposures from a common source. If the period of the outbreak falls within one incubation period, then the type of epidemic is common source, single exposure or point source epidemic. Difference between single exposure and multiple exposure epidemics: Propagated epidemic results from person to person transmission of the infectious agent over a prolonged duration of time. For e.g., Polio epidemic, COVID-19. Note: Hepatitis A epidemic is generally an example of a propagated epidemic. However, it does not always follow this pattern. In the given scenario, since the outbreak lasts for a short duration of 3 months (about 3 incubation periods for hepatitis A), it is considered to be a point source, multiple exposure outbreak. Common source, single exposure epidemic: Common source, multiple exposure epidemic. Nature of exposure: Single, brief exposure. Nature of epidemic: Explosive with clustering of cases within a short interval of time. Duration of epidemic: Falls <1 incubation period of a particular disease. Example: An epidemic of food poisoning. Multiple, continuous or intermittent exposures for a prolonged time: Less chance of clustering of cases within short interval of time. Extends >1 incubation period of a particular disease. Outbreak of cholera.",
