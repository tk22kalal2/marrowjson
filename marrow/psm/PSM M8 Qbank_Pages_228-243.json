Varicella-zoster localized in a patient with an intact immune system with a lesion that can be contained/covered does not require droplet precaution. Disseminated varicella in any patient requires airborne and contact precautions. Diphtheria, pertussis, and mycoplasma are transmitted by droplets and hence require droplet precaution and isolation. Although patients are not contagious starting 48 hours after antibiotic therapy, droplet precautions are typically maintained until the completion of the antibiotic course and are culture-negative on two cultures taken 24 hours apart. Droplet precautions include the use of masks, gowns, gloves, and protective eye gear when providing direct patient care.",

      "explanation": "The polysaccharide vaccine against Streptococcus pneumoniae (PPSV-23) is most beneficial for patients with sickle cell disease. S. pneumoniae is an encapsulated organism that is detected by the spleen and is removed. However, in sickle cell disease, the sickled cells block the vessels in the spleen, which results in splenic infarction. This hyposplenism results in an increased risk of pneumococcal infection. Hence, pneumococcal vaccine (PPSV-23) is given to these patients as a prophylactic measure to reduce this risk.",

      "explanation": "The above image shows an induration of >10 mm after 72 hours of intradermal PPD injection, suggesting a positive tuberculin test (TST), indicating recent or past infection. In TST, 0.1 ml of PPD (purified protein derivative) containing 5 TU (tuberculosis unit) is injected intradermally and induration is read after 48-72 hours. An induration of 10 mm or more is considered positive in patients from countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis. Surrounding erythema is not considered. A positive tuberculin test indicates hypersensitivity to tubercular protein, denoting either latent infection with tubercle bacilli, or BCG immunization, or recent or past infection with or without clinical disease. False positives may be seen in infections with related mycobacteria and false negatives in miliary tuberculosis, severely immunosuppressed states, etc.",
