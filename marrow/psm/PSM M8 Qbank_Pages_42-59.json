      "explanation": "Disease → Impairment → Disability → Handicap is the most logical sequence among the given options. Disease is a state of physiological/psychological dysfunction. Impairment is any loss or abnormality in normal structure or function. Disability is the inability to carry out normal actions due to impairment. Handicap is the disadvantage due to disability that limits fulfilment of a role that is normal. The sequence of development of a handicap is: Disease/Disorder → Impairment → Disability → Handicap. For example, Polio (Disease/Disorder) → Paralysis (Impairment) → Limited mobility (Disability) → Limits in finding employment (Handicap).",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The correctly matched events relating to the given example are as follows: The WHO definition of impairment is 'any loss or abnormality of psychological, physiological or anatomical structure or function'. E.g., loss of a foot. An initial impairment may cause a secondary impairment as well. The WHO defines disability as 'any restriction or lack of ability to perform an activity in the manner or within the range considered normal for a human being'. Because of impairment, the affected person may be unable to carry out certain activities and hence the person is considered disabled. According to the WHO, a handicap is 'a disadvantage for a given individual, resulting from an impairment or a disability, that limits or prevents the fulfilment of a role that is normal (depending on age, sex, and social and cultural factors) for that individual'. The disadvantages experienced by a person as a result of disability make them handicapped. Event Example Disease/Disorder Accident Impairment Loss of foot Disability Cannot Walk Handicap Unemployed",

      "options": {
        "A": "It implies that individual factors in the web have equal weightage",

        "D": "It suggests ways of interrupting the disease occurrence"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The web of causation for a disease suggests a number of ways to interrupt the disease occurrence/progression. This model was suggested by MacMahon and Pugh in their book 'Epidemiologic Principles and Methods'. Web of causation considers all the predisposing factors and their complex interrelationship with each other. This model is ideally suited in the study of chronic disease. The web of causation does not imply that the disease is controlled only when all the multiple chains of causation are removed. Sometimes removal of one significant link is sufficient to control the disease. In a multifactorial event, individual factors are by no means of equal weightage. The importance of each factor is expressed in terms of relative risk.",

      "explanation": "Primary prevention is not possible in the pathogenesis period of a disease. It can only be done in the period of pre-pathogenesis. The two phases in the natural history of a disease include: Period of pre-pathogenesis: It is before the onset of disease in humans. The disease agent has not entered the host, but the factors favouring the disease already exist. Primary prevention (health promotion and specific protection) is applicable in this period. Period of pathogenesis: It begins with the entry of the organism till recovery, death, or disability. Secondary (halting of the disease process) and tertiary prevention (measures to limit disability) are applicable in this period.

        "C": "Surveillance",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Interruption in the transmission of a disease is called elimination. It is a step towards eradication. Elimination is a reduction in the number of new cases of an infectious disease to zero (or a very low defined target rate) in a defined geographical area as a result of deliberate efforts. Continued measures to prevent re-establishment of transmission are required. Eradication is a complete and permanent worldwide reduction to zero new cases of an infectious disease through deliberate efforts. No further control measures are required. Surveillance is the continuous scrutiny of factors that determine the occurrence and distribution of disease and ill health. Control aims at decreasing the incidence, duration, and transmission of the disease. It also aims at decreasing the physical and psychological complications of a disease.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Herd immunity aids the most in disease elimination. Herd immunity, achieved especially through immunization, goes a long way in helping the elimination of diseases. When a high level of herd immunity is maintained, the susceptible population is reduced to a small proportion, thereby eliminating the disease. The purpose of isolation is to protect the community by preventing the transfer of infection from the reservoir to the possible susceptible hosts. Quarantine refers to restrictions on the healthy contacts of an infectious disease.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "In the given scenario, as the disease has zero incidence, we can say the disease has been eliminated from the region. Elimination is a reduction in the number of new cases of an infectious disease to zero (or a very low defined target rate) in a defined geographical area as a result of deliberate efforts.

Primordial prevention is preventing the emergence of risk factors among population groups in which these risk factors have not yet appeared. Most adult health problems (obesity, hypertension) have their early origins in childhood. It is in childhood that lifestyles are formed, i.e., eating patterns, physical exercise, smoking, etc. In primordial prevention, efforts are made to discourage children from adopting harmful lifestyles. These lifestyle changes, when made by adults, are known as primary prevention.",

The ICD-11 was released by the WHO in June 2018 and was presented at the World Health Assembly in May 2019 for adoption by the Member States. It has come into effect from 1 January 2022. Its designations for antibiotic resistance align with the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS). It is given by the WHO and is revised every 10 years. New chapters added in ICD-11 are: Traditional medicine, Sexual health: Gender incongruence has been moved from mental health to sexual health, Gaming disorder has been added under Addictive disorders, and Immune system disorders, which will enable the better study of allergies. It has more detail on cancer, specifically different types of skin cancer, as well as on heart health and weight disorders compared to ICD-10.",
