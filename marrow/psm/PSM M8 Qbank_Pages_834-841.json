      "explanation": "Quantiles are elements in a distribution that divide data into equal groups. They are also knownas fractiles. Median divides a distribution into two equal parts, so it is considered as a quantile.Quantiles are used for continuous, quantitative data.Quintiles are a type of quantile that divides data into 5 equal groups.",

      "explanation": "Here, the 100th student will have the 40th percentile value for height.To arrive at this, we use the formula R = P/100 x (n + 1).where R is the rank of the desired observation, P is the quantile/percentile desired and n is thenumber of variables in the data.Thus, R40/100 x (250 + 1) = 0.4 x 251 = 100.4.This is rounded up to the closest number making R = 100.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The 2nd quartile gives the central value of 180 elements. The central value of a distribution isgiven by the median. It divides the distribution into the ratio of 1:1.In quartiles elements of the distribution are divided into 4 equal parts by 3 values. Each partcontains a quarter, i.e., 25% of the values. So two quarters would give half of the values. So theelement present at the position of the 2nd quartile would be the central value, i.e., the median,with half the values before and half the values after it.
