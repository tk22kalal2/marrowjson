It is aimed at preventing unintentionalexposure of the embryo or fetus to radiation.This rule states that if a radiograph is being done on the abdomen or pelvis of a woman in herchildbearing age, then it should be done during the 10 days following the onset of menstruation.In most situations, there is growing evidence that strict adherence to the \"ten-day rule\" may beunnecessarily restrictive. Since organogenesis starts 3 to 5 weeks post-conception, it was felt thatradiation exposure in early pregnancy couldn't result in malformation. Based on this, it wassuggested to do away with the 10-day rule and replace it with a 28-day rule. This means thatradiological examination if justified, can be carried throughout the cycle until a period is missed.607",
