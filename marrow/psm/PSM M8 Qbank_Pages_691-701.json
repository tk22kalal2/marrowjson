      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Barosinusitis occurs in decompression sickness or Caisson's disease. It is due to the suddenexpansion of air in the sinuses.It can be seen in:•Divers who ascend rapidly from deep-sea (high pressure) to the surface of the earth (lowpressure)Pilots of unpressurized aircraft or mountaineers who rapidly ascended from the surface of theearth (high-pressure zone) to a high altitude (low-pressure zone)Under high pressure, gases get compressed, and their solubility increases. When a person is indeep-sea (high-pressure zone) for a long time, an increased amount of nitrogen gets dissolved inhis body. When he suddenly comes back to the surface (atmospheric pressure or a low-pressurezone), the solubility of gases decreases and they escape from the dissolved state forming nitrogenbubbles.These bubbles can cause sudden expansion of air in various parts of the body such as the middleear (barotitis), sinuses (barosinusitis), beneath teeth (barodontalgia), intestinal loops (abdominaldistension), and emphysema.Nitrogen bubbles can also cause chokes (dyspnoea), bends (joint pain), and prickles (nerveirritation).698The definitive treatment for Caisson's disease is recompression.",
