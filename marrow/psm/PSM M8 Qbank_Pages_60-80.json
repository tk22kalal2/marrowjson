The immediate cause is the immediate/terminal event leading to death. In this patient: I(a) - Disease directly leading to death: Lobar pneumonia; I(b) - Antecedent cause: MDR tuberculosis; II - HIV. Respiratory failure is a mode of dying in this patient. It is not the cause of death. Terminal events like circulatory failure and respiratory failure are modes of dying. They should not be written as the immediate cause of death in the death certificate because they are just signs of death. Simply put, respiratory failure is 'how he died' whereas lobar pneumonia is 'why he died'. Therefore, lobar pneumonia (why he died) is the cause of the death.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "A new drug that prevents death yet does not cure the disease will cause an increase in prevalence but the incidence remains the same. In the given scenario, the drug reduces early deaths but does not cure prostate cancer. Hence, there is a paradoxical increase in the prevalence while the incidence remains the same. Prevalence depends on two factors, the incidence and duration of illness. If the population is stable and incidence and duration are unchanging, the relationship between incidence and prevalence can be expressed as: P = IxD (I = Incidence and D = Mean duration). This equation shows that the longer the duration of the disease, the greater the prevalence. Note: In chronic diseases like TB, prevalence will be higher than incidence. If a new treatment for a disease is effective, incidence does not change but prevalence decreases as the duration of disease decreases. If the treatment only prevents death but doesn't cure the disease, it may cause a paradoxical increase in prevalence.",
