Case definition for notification of smallpox: An individual of any age with acute onset fever, malaise, severe prostration, headache, and backache 2-4 days before the onset of rash. Development of a maculopapular rash starting on the face and forearms and then spreading to the trunk and legs. Rash evolves within 48 hours to deep-seated, firm, and well-circumscribed vesicles, which later become umbilicated or confluent pustules. Lesions that appear at the same stage of development (i.e., all are vesicles or all are pustules) on any given part of the body. No alternative diagnosis explaining the illness. Laboratory confirmation: Identification of variola (smallpox) DNA with PCR or isolation of the virus from a clinical specimen.",

The secondary attack rate of chickenpox is very high, 85% (range 61%–100%). The characteristic infective vesicle, surrounded by an erythematous halo, is described as a dewdrop on a rose petal. The scab of chickenpox is not infective. The vaccine given for chickenpox prophylaxis is a live attenuated vaccine.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The most common complication of measles is otitis media, occurring in about 10-15% of patients. Measles is caused by an RNA virus of the Paramyxovirus family. The incubation period of measles is 10 to 14 days. The only source of infection is a case of measles. Carriers are not known to occur. The complications of measles include: • Otitis media (most common) • Measles-associated diarrhea • Pneumonia • Conjunctivitis • Febrile seizures • Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (rare but is fatal) - occurs several years after primary infection",

        "D": "The child should be given the second dose of measles at 12 months of age."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "In this child, the next dose of measles vaccine should be given after 4 weeks. While the scheduled age of receiving a measles vaccine is 9 months, it can be lowered up to 6 months during a measles epidemic in the community. For infants immunized between 6 to 9 months of age, a second dose should be administered as soon as the child reaches the age of 9 months. It is to ensure adequate immunity has developed, provided that 4 weeks have elapsed since the last dose. In this child, the first dose was given at the age of 8 and a half months, and there must be a gap of 4 weeks between the two doses. If the child were to be vaccinated as soon as she turns 9 months old, only two weeks would have elapsed.",
