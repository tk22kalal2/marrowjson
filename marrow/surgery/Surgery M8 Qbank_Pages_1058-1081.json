Pain out of proportion to physical examination is ahallmark finding in HF burns. Systemic absorption of fluoride ions can result in intravascularchelation of calcium causing hypocalcemia.Depletion of calcium causes inhibition of the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, leading tohyperkalemia and subsequent life-threatening arrhythmias. Therefore ECG monitoring isimperative. ECG abnormalities that can occur include prolonged QTc (from hypocalcemia)and QRS widening (from hyperkalemia).Following copious irrigation of the burn site with water, the mainstay of treatment is with topicalapplication of calcium gluconate gel. If the pain does not subside, or if systemic signs ensue, anintraarterial injection of calcium gluconate can be given in the affected extremity.",

This isdouble what the ATLS guidelines advise for other burns as electrical burns may causemyoglobinuria and acute kidney injury.Most of the electrical burns are of severe degree and cause third-degree burns.The fluid resuscitation is done to ensure urine output of 100 mL/hr in adults and 1-1.5 mL/kg/hrin children &lt; 30 kg, until the urine clears from pigmentation. The IV fluid is then titrated downto ensure the urine output of 0.5 mL/kg/hr.Electrical injuries are usually divided into low and high-voltage injuries.• Low voltage injuries cause small, localized, deep burns.• High voltage injuries damage by flash (External burn) and conduction (Internal burn)The myocardium may be directly damaged without pacing interruption.

        "A": "Silver sulphadiazine cream dressing",

        "D": "Collagen dressing"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "1078Scald injury (damage from contact with hot liquids) that appears pink in colour, has oozing, andpain is suggestive of a 2nd-degree burn (i.e. partial-thickness burn). Collagen dressing is the mostappropriate management for this injury.The best dressing for burn wounds is skin; collagen is a good substitute for skin, especially inpartial-thickness burns. For full-thickness burns, sequential excision and grafting should beconsidered.Initial treatment for burns includes cleaning burnt areas and removing loose dead skin. Blistersare de-roofed and an appropriate dressing is applied.Biological dressing (collagen dressings, amniotic membrane, etc.) is the preferred dressingmaterial, especially in partial thickness burns.If this is not available then a non-adhesive dressing like paraffin gauze impregnated with silversulfadiazine (SSD) cream, colloidal silver, ionic silver cream, or silver nitrate cream can beapplied. Since increased resistance to SSD has recently emerged, it should be judiciously used andreserved for deep dermal, full thickness, infected, and old neglected burns.Depths of a BurnEpidermisHDermisFirst degree-Superficial seconddegree--Deep second degreeSubcutaneous fat------Third degreeMuscle-Fourth degreeOMARROW",

Among the given topical antibiotics, only mafenide acetatepenetrates burn eschar to reach the interface with the patient's viable tissue.This agent has the disadvantage that it is quite painful on any partial thickness areas, and it is acarbonic anhydrase inhibitor and can potentially cause metabolic acidosis.",

      "explanation": "Sweating is usually absent in classic (epidemic) heatstroke (CHS).Heatstroke occurs as a result of an imbalance between heat production and heat dissipation(sweating). The skin is pink or ashen and sometimes, paradoxically, dry and hot. Dry skin in thepresence of hyperpyrexia is virtually pathognomonic. It is of 2 types:•Exertion-induced heat stroke is seen in people with prolonged exposure to or physical exertionin high temperatures, usually without adequate training.• Sedentary heatstroke (CHS) is a disease of elderly or infirm people whose cardiovascular systemsare unable to adapt to the stress of a hot environment and release sufficient heat such that bodytemperature rises.Heat Cramps:• These are painful spasms of voluntary muscles which follow strenuous work in a hotatmosphere.•Caused by loss of water and salt in profuse sweating.Heat exhaustion/heat prostration:Collapse without any elevation of body temperature• Occurs due to exposure to high temperature in closed environment•Precipitated by muscular exercise and unsuitable clothing•Extreme exhaustion with peripheral vascular collapse with scanty sweating.",
