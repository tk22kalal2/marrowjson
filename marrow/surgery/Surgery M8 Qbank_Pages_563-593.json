      "explanation": "Explanation:The most common presentation of an abdominal desmoid tumor is an abdominal mass.578Desmoid tumors, also known as fibromatosis, aggressive fibromatosis or desmoid-typefibromatosis are locally aggressive tumors that lack metastatic potential. Desmoid tumors can besporadic in origin or associated with familial adenomatous polyposis.These tumors arise from fibro-aponeurotic tissue and typically are manifested as a slowly growingmass. They present as firm, non-painful, non-tender masses in the abdominal wall, shoulder, hipand limbs, mesentery, and pelvis. They are also associated with trauma, pregnancy, and oralcontraceptive usage.The investigation of choice for a desmoid tumor is MRI. It is superior to CT in defining thepattern and the extent of involvement and can determine recurrence after surgery. Diagnosis isestablished by a biopsy with immunohistochemistry, which stains positive for beta-catenin, actinand vimentin, and negative for desmin, cytokeratin and S-100.Treatment:• An initial observation is preferred for stable, asymptomatic, primary or recurrent desmoids,especially if surgery can cause high mortality.• Surgical resection with negative margin clearance is reserved for patients with small abdominalwall tumors associated with pain or an increase in size.•Tamoxifen and NSAIDs are used as first-line medical therapy. Other systemic treatment optionsare low-dose chemotherapy, tyrosinase kinase inhibitors, and full-dose chemotherapy• Radiotherapy is preferred for candidates unfit for surgery, patients refusing surgery and whensurgical resection is associated with high morbidity.",

It is a variant of familialadenomatous polyposis.Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant condition and is caused due tothe mutation in the APC gene located on chromosome 5.Clinically, patients develop hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps in the colon andrectum. Some patients may also develop duodenal adenomas. The lifetime risk of developingcolorectal carcinoma in these patients is 100%.The treatment of the FAP includes total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis(IPAA).Variants of FAP are:•Gardner's syndrome- It is an autosomal dominant variant of FAP.
