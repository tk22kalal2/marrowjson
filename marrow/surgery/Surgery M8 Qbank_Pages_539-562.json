It is made perpendicular to a line connecting the anteriorsuperior iliac spine to the umbilicus, with its center at McBurney's point. When better access isneeded, the gridiron incision can be converted to a Rutherford Morison incision by extending theincision obliquely upwards and laterally.Rutherford Morison's incision is suitable for a para- or retrocecal appendix that is fixed. It is anoblique muscle-cutting incision starting from McBurney's point and extending upward andlaterally as needed. All layers (skin, subcutaneous tissues, external oblique, internaloblique, transversus abdominis, and the peritoneum) are divided along the incision line.In recent years, the transverse skin crease (Lanz) incision has gained popularity due to improvedexposure and ease of extension when necessary. This incision is placed approximately 2 cm belowthe umbilicus along the midclavicular-midinguinal line, with its length adjusted according to thepatient's size and obesity. If required, the incision can be extended medially by retracting ordividing the rectus abdominis muscle (statement 4).555When there is uncertainty in the diagnosis, especially in the presence of intestinal obstruction, alower midline abdominal incision is preferred over a right lower paramedian incision.Incisions used in appendicectomyGrid ironincisionLanzincisionMARROWRutherfordMorrison'sincisionLowermidlineabdominalincision",

Thebest management approach here is observation.Carcinoid tumour may be detected in ~0.5% of appendectomy specimens. Appendectomy isadequate in the treatment of cases with a diameter of &lt;1 cm and in those with a diameter of 1-2cm without lymphovascular invasion.If a tumour is found after appendicectomy:• If it is an adenocarcinoma, perform right hemicolectomy.• If it is a carcinoid tumour, treatment differs according to the tumour size:• &lt;1 cm Observation-• 1–2 cm – Right hemicolectomy if a lymphovascular invasion is seenRight hemicolectomy treatment is indicated even in tumours &lt; 2 cm in case of:•&gt;2 cm - Right hemicolectomy•Tumours localized at the base of the appendix• Invasion of lymphatic ducts, serosa and mesoappendix• Presence of regional lymph node metastasis• Positive surgical margins•• Mucin production (mucinous carcinoid tumours)• High mitotic fast cellular pleomorphism",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of a patient with mucinous cystadenoma appendix and imagingfindings are suggestive of pseudomyxoma peritonei.Pseudomyxoma peritonei refers to a condition of mucinous ascites arising due to the rupture of amucinous tumor of appendix or ovary. It most commonly occurs in patients between 40-50 yearsof age. They are often asymptomatic or present with non-specific complaints like abdominal painand distension.Physical examination may reveal ascites with non shifting dullness and rarely, a palpableabdominal mass. CT scan may reveal accumulation of mucinous material and scallopedindentation of the visceral surfaces of the liver and spleen. The peritoneal surfaces may bethickened due to the solid components of the tumor. The histology of the primary appendicealtumor is an important predictor of survival.Management consists of extensive resection of the tumor (cytoreduction) and intraperitonealheated chemotherapy (IPHC). Surgical management may include omentectomy, resection of theperitoneum and involved organs, appendectomy or a right hemicolectomy.562",
