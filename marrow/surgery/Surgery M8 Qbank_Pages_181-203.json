      "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis of a patient with greenish discharge from multiple ducts is duct ectasia. Duct ectasia is the dilatation of breast ducts. It is the most common cause of nipple discharge in non-lactating women. This condition is associated with smoking and diabetes. The initial stage of this disease consists of dilatation of one or more lactiferous ducts. These ducts get filled with stagnant brown or green-colored secretions. In the later stages, the accumulation of fluid in the lactiferous ducts leads to infection and inflammation, causing periductal mastitis. Patients may present with nipple discharge, abscess, fistula, or nipple retraction. Treatment includes: • Initial stages - oral antibiotics, needle aspiration, or incision and drainage of the abscess • Recurrent episodes - Hadfield operation (cone excision of multiple ducts). • A single duct involvement - microdochectomy.",

      "explanation": "In a patient with a breast abscess, the next step after a failed aspiration is to attempt aspirationonce again under antibiotic cover.Incision and drainage is not preferred, as it can potentially interfere with breastfeeding, anddelicate structures such as ducts, lobules, and tubules may be injured, possibly leading to anon-healing milk fistula.A breast abscess is a complication of acute mastitis, which is more common in new mothers at thebeginning of lactation (lactational mastitis). Non-lactational mastitis is more common in diabetic,immunosuppressed people and people predisposed by duct ectasia and periareolar infections.Clinical features of a breast abscess include:• Fever and malaise• Localized pain and tenderness• Redness and swelling of the affected breast• Positive fluctuation test.200An ultrasonogram of the affected breast is performed to confirm the abscess, and treatmentproceeds as follows:••Analgesics, antipyretics, and breast support for pain and fever relief.Aspiration is performed under antibiotic cover, and the pus is cultured. If aspiration provesunsuccessful, it should be reattempted after a few days.• Incision and drainage should be considered in cases of:• Mastitis unresponsive to antibiotics for 48 hours..Brawny induration.• Progressive mastitis with persistent feverNote:ConditionSymptomsSigns (if any)Bacterial mastitisLocalized inflammation due to ascending infection or infection due to milk stasisDullpainTendernessErythemaBreast abscessOccurs as a complication ofmastitis Pus formationManagementAnalgesicsAntibiotics (Dicloxacillin500 mg every 6 hoursorally; Erythromycin if allergic to penicillin)Adequate breast supportThrobbingpainPoint tenderness ErythemaInduration of skin (if chronic) LymphadenopathyFluctuation test +vePus pointmay be presentAnalgesicsAdequate breast supportAspiration of Pus underantibiotic cover; repeated aspirations if required Incision& drainage201",

      "explanation": "The next step in management is the excision of the cyst.Treatment of breast cyst:• If the aspirate is clear (non-blood stained) or if the cyst resolves completely then no furthertreatment is required.• If the aspirate is blood-stained or if the cyst recurs, then a core biopsy or local excision should beperformed. The resulting tissue should be sent for histopathology for the exclusion ofcystadenocarcinoma, especially in elderly women.",

In obese men, increased fat depositionover the breasts is referred to as pseudo-gynecomastia.Gynecomastia is defined as ° 2 cm subareolar breast tissue. It can be physiological orpathological.Physiologic gynecomastia occurs during three phases of life:• Neonatal period• Adolescence• SenescenceCommon to each of these phases is an excess of circulating estrogens in relation to circulatingtestosterone. Neonatal gynecomastia is caused by the action of placental estrogens on neonatalbreast tissues. In adolescence, there is an excess of estradiol relative to testosterone. Insenescence, the circulating testosterone level falls, resulting in relative hyperestrogenism.",
