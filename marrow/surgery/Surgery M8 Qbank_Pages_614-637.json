      "question": "An elderly female presented with severe persisting per rectal itching for the past 1 year,despite standard topical therapy. On examination, irregular eczematous lesions were seen atthe anal orifice. Biopsy of the lesion revealed large vacuolated cells containing mucin. Whichof the following is it likely to be?620",
      "options": {
        "A": "Squamous cell carcinoma in situ",
        "B": "Basal cell carcinoma.",

        "D": "Marginal anal cell carcinoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The given history and presence of large vacuolated cells (Paget cells) on biopsy is suggestive ofPaget's disease of the anal canal. It is a rare intraepithelial adenocarcinoma.Paget's disease is most commonly seen in areas with a high density of apocrine sweat glands, inelderly females. These can develop into an invasive cancer of the underlying apocrine glands.Clinical features include intractable itching, burning, bleeding per rectally. 10% of the patients areasymptomatic. On examination, eczematous, well-demarcated plaque, with occasional ulcerationand scaling can be seen.On histology presence of Paget cells (large, vacuolated cells with mucin) confirms the diagnosis.Treatment:• Treatment of choice- complete excision•Limited, noninvasive disease-wide local excision and closure of the defect with primary suturesor with V-Y advancement flaps634• Invasive component- radical resection with abdominoperineal resection (APR)• Medically unfit for surgery - topical 5-FU, imiquimod, cryotherapy, or argon beam laser therapy• Recurrence- re-excision (as long as the disease remains noninvasive)Note: Most common site of extra-mammary Paget's disease - anogenital region &gt; axilla &gt;eyelid. Perianal Paget's disease is usually associated with underlying visceral malignancy, mostcommonly colorectal adenocarcinoma.",

      "explanation": "Anorectal melanoma is staged by the depth or thickness of the lesion.Anal canal melanoma is more common in females. The tumor appears as small and polypoidal orlarge and ulcerating. Clinical features include:• Anorectal bleeding, itching, pain, mass636•Tenesmus, and changes in bowel habits• Mesorectal lymph node metastases.• Inguinal lymphadenopathy•Distant spread- to bones, lungs, and liverDiagnosis is frequently made following hemorrhoidectomy or local excision of the perianal mass.Treatment:•⚫ Tumors without anal sphincter involvement- wide local excision with negative margins.• Large tumors invading sphincters- palliative APRRegardless of stage, 5-year survival rates for anorectal melanoma are very poor, averaging atabout 6%.
