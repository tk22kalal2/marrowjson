The kidneys tryto compensate for alkalosis by secreting Na+ and HCO3-. However, the loss of sodium stimulatesthe secretion of aldosterone via the RAAS pathway. The aldosterone causes active reabsorption ofsodium in exchange for K+ and H+ ions. Loss of potassium ions leads to the developmentof hypokalemia. Loss of H+ ions in urine lowers the urinary pH resulting in aciduria. It iscalled paradoxical aciduria, since the body initially lost H+ ions due to loss of HCl, and instead of427compensating that loss, the body is losing more H+ ions through urine.The cervix sign and nipple sign are signs of CHPS seen on ultrasonography:•• Double-layered hypertrophic mucosa protrudes into the stomach, creating the so-called nipplesign.•The sonographic appearance of the hypertrophied pylorus resembles that of the uterine cervixand is sometimes referred to as the cervix sign.The given ultrasound image shows thickened pylorus, with cervix sign and nipple sign.Cervix sign- Nipple signPOST2 MIN FEEDTreatment:• The child should be rehydrated and the metabolic abnormality has to becorrected preoperatively.• The Ramstedt pyloromyotomy is the standard surgical procedure for its treatment.",

The nerve of Latarjet from the anterior and posterior vagal trunk suppliesthe acid pepsin areas of the stomach. It is spared in HSV. Usually, the motor branch to thepylorus is also preserved.There are 3 types of vagotomy•Highly selective vagotomy•Truncal vagotomy + gastrojejunostomy••Truncal vagotomy + antrectomy.Highly selective vagotomy• Acid reduction is minimum.•Highest ulcer recurrence rate.• Minimum postoperative complications.Truncal vagotomy + antrectomy• Acid reduction is maximum.•• Least ulcer recurrence rate.• Maximum postoperative complications.Note: Vagal nerves are motor to the stomach and denervation of the antro-pyloro-duodenalsegment results in gastric stasis after truncal vagotomy. Hence, a drainage procedure, mostcommonly Heineke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty or gastrojejunostomy is done along with vagotomy.The criminal nerve of Grassi is a branch of the posterior vagal trunk that arises at thegastroesophageal junction and supplies the fundus of the stomach. It is called a criminalnerve because it is often missed during vagotomy procedures and can result in recurrent pepticulcer disease.437Highly selective vagotomyAnterior trunk ofthe vagus nerveAnterior nerve oflaterjet (spared)PylorusbranchDistal 6-8 cms of theoesophagus is skeletonized6-8 cm7 cmDenervation is stopped 7 cmsproximal to the pylorus, thussparing the pylorus and antrumBranches to thebody and fundusCrow's feetbranchesMARROW",

Hypoglycemia is seen in late dumping syndrome secondary to raisedinsulin levels.Dumping syndrome is a complication occurring post gastrectomy. It can be early or late.Early dumping syndrome is due to the high osmotic load that reaches the small bowel, leading tosequestration of fluid from the circulation into the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). This fluid shiftinduces autonomic responses. It is characterized by more GI and fewer cardiovascular effects suchas:•Epigastric fullness• Sweating• Lightheadedness• Tachycardia• DiarrheaSymptoms are aggravated by having more food and relieved by lying down.439Late dumping syndrome is due to an increase in insulin levels and secondary hypoglycemia. Thishypoglycemia causes a catecholamine surge, which results in predominantly cardiovascular effectssuch as:•• DiaphoresisTremulousness• Light-headedness• Tachycardia• ConfusionThe symptoms are aggravated by exercise and relieved by having food.The principal treatment for both types of dumping syndrome is dietary manipulation.

Gastrectomy is the treatment of choice in severecases of Menetrier's disease.Menetrier's disease is a premalignant condition. The disease seems to be caused byoverexpression of transforming growth factor-alpha i.e., TGF-alpha (not TNF-alpha), whichstimulates the EGFR pathway, resulting in increased proliferation of mucus cells/foveolarhyperplasia. This results in gross hypertrophy of the gastric mucosal folds, mucus production, andhypochlorhydria. The antrum is usually spared.There is a loss of albumin (up to 10 g/day), across the gastric mucosa leading to hypoproteinemia.Secondary symptoms include weight loss, diarrhea, and peripheral edema.Histologically, it is characterized by hyperplasia of foveolar mucous cells. The glands are cysticallydilated and elongated with a corkscrew-like appearance as shown in the image below.Cetuximab, an EGFR inhibitory antibody, is now considered the first-line treatment forMenetrier's disease, leaving total gastrectomy for severe disease with persistent and substantialprotein loss refractory to cetuximab.441",
