      "explanation": "The given image shows a meshed, split-thickness skin graft. Split grafts are meshed to expand thesurface area that can be covered but it does not improve the cosmetic appearance.Less dermis in the split-thickness skin graft translates into less primary contraction (the degree towhich a graft shrinks in surface area after harvesting and before grafting) and more secondarycontraction (the degree to which a graft shrinks during healing).1117Less dermis also translates into a better chance of graft survival. Thin split grafts have a lowprimary contraction, high secondary contraction, and high reliability of graft take. However, theytend to heal with abnormal pigmentation and poor durability.The image given below shows the procedure of obtaining a split-thickness skin graft using ahandheld Humby knife.Type of graftCompositionSplit-thickness graftFull-thickness graftEpidermis + part of the dermEpidermis + full dermisisRelatively poorCosmetic appearanceGraft take/survival High chance of survivalContractionUseLesser primary contraction and more secondary contractionCan cover large areas of defectsGood (texture and pigmentation are better matched)Poor (long healing time and vascularization)More primary contraction and lesser secondary contractionFor areas where least contraction (finger) or best cosmesis(face) is desiredOMARROW",

Twotriangular flaps are raised. Theoretically, a 60-degree angle flap will result in a 75% increase in thelength of the scar and a 90-degree reorientation of central wound.Angles smaller than 60 degrees are easier to transpose but result in less lengthening andrealignment of the scar to less than 90 degrees.
