      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The infant was delivered at full-term by normal vaginal delivery, which makes hyaline membrane disease less likely as it typically occurs in preterm infants. Meconium aspiration syndrome is also less likely as there is no mention of meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia would typically present with more severe respiratory distress and other symptoms. Transient tachypnea of the newborn is a common cause of respiratory distress in newborns, especially after vaginal delivery.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The posterolateral variant of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is known as Bochdalek hernia, while the anteromedial variant is called Morgagni hernia. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia results from the failure of closure of the pleuroperitoneal canal in the developing fetus. Typically in CDH, there is a left-sided posterolateral diaphragmatic defect allowing herniation of abdominal viscera into the chest. 80% of CDH develops on the left side. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia Central tendon of the diaphragm Anterior (Morgagni) Central Right Postero-lateral (Bochdalek) hernias The following sequence of events in CDH leads to the development of pulmonary hypoplasia. Sequence of events in congenital diaphragmatic hernia: Failure of normal closure of the pleuro-peritoneal canal in developing embryo Abdominal contents herniate through the resultant defect Compress the developing lung Pulmonary hypoplasia Pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypoplasia are the most important prognostic factors in congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Other poor prognostic indicators in CDH: The presence of liver in the thoracic cavity Early respiratory distress, within 24 h after birth Need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation Herniation to the contralateral lung (right-sided hernia) Treatment of congenital diaphragmatic hernia: A variable period of time (24-72 hours) is to be allowed for stabilization before surgical repair. Immediate respiratory support should be provided, including rapid endotracheal intubation and sedation. Bag and mask ventilation is contraindicated in newborns with congenital diaphragmatic hernia because it causes distension of the stomach, which in turn may limit the expansion of the already hypoplastic lung. During surgery, the viscera are reduced into the abdominal cavity, and the posterolateral defect in the diaphragm is closed using interrupted, nonabsorbable sutures. In most cases (80%-90%), a hernia sac is not present. If identified, it is excised at the time of repair.",

        "D": "Pericardial cyst is a differential diagnosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Early respiratory distress, within 6 hours of birth, is thought to be a poor prognostic sign. Features of a Bochdalek hernia: • Respiratory distress is a cardinal sign in infants with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). • Early respiratory distress, within 6 hours after birth, is thought to be a poor prognostic sign. • Children with CDH may also have a scaphoid abdomen and increased chest wall diameter. • Bowel sounds may also be heard in the chest, with a bilateral decrease in breath sounds. • The point of maximal cardiac impulse may be displaced away from the side of a hernia if a mediastinal shift has occurred. • Retroperitoneal fat, left kidney, spleen, or only the omentum commonly herniate through the defect. If the defect is large, most abdominal contents, including the stomach, may herniate. Diagnosis: • Chest radiography and passage of a nasal gastric tube confirm the diagnosis. • CDH can be diagnosed on prenatal ultrasonography (between 16 and 24 weeks of gestation). • High-speed fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can further define the lesion. Ultrasonography findings: • Polyhydramnios • Chest mass • Mediastinal shift • Gastric bubble or a liver in the thoracic cavity • Fetal hydrops. Differential diagnosis: • Eventration • Cystic lung lesion (pulmonary sequestration or cystic adenomatoid malformation). • Group B streptococcal sepsis: associated with delayed onset of symptoms and a CDH often on the right side. • Pneumothorax: always occurs on the contralateral side to the CDH. Treatment: A variable period of time (24-72 hours) to allow for stabilization before surgical repair. The viscera are reduced into the abdominal cavity, and the posterolateral defect in the diaphragm is closed using interrupted, nonabsorbable sutures. In most cases (80%-90%), a hernia sac is not present. If identified, it is excised at the time of repair. Conventional mechanical ventilation, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are the 3 main strategies to support respiratory failure in the newborn with CDH. Good relative indicators of stability are as follows: • Requirement for conventional ventilation only • Low peak inspiratory pressure • Fio2 < 50. If the defect is too large, a porous polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex) patch is used.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given clinical history with an X-ray showing a triple bubble sign is suggestive of jejunal atresia. The next best step is to perform a contrast study to localize the site of obstruction. Small bowel atresias present with intestinal obstruction soon after birth. Bilious vomiting is the dominant feature in jejunal atresia. Abdominal distension is more prominent in ileal atresia. A small amount of pale meconium may be passed, despite the atresia. Plain abdomen radiographs in a jejunal/ileal atresia case will show multiple air-fluid levels and dilated loops. They don't reliably distinguish small and large bowels in neonates and hence contrast studies are often required to localize the obstruction. Water-soluble enemas (Gastrograffin, Hypaque) are particularly useful in differentiating atresia from meconium ileus and Hirschsprung disease. Contrast studies also help to rule out distal intestinal obstruction and occasionally may act therapeutically to relieve obstructions. In most cases of jejunal/ileal atresia, the distal end of the dilated proximal small bowel is resected and a primary end-to-end anastomosis is done. If the proximal bowel is extremely dilated, it may need to be tapered to the distal bowel before anastomosis. Other options: Option A: CT is not recommended for neonates owing to the harmful effects of radiation. Option C: USG abdomen does not help to localize the site of obstruction and is more useful in the diagnosis of intussusception, where there is an abdominal mass. Option D: Exploratory laparotomy is not done for diagnosing intestinal atresias.",

Meconium ileus (also known as DIOS - Distal Intestinal Obstructive Syndrome) is defined as intestinal obstruction due to inspissated meconium within the terminal ileum. In the Bishop-Koop procedure, the proximal distended limb is joined to the side of the distal small bowel. This is vented by a 'chimney' to the abdominal wall. The Bishop-Koop operation with its irrigating stoma is now only rarely used. Bishop-Koop Anastomosis ileostomy MAP Proximal OMARROW End-to-side ileoileostomy Distal Ramstedt pyloromyotomy is the standard operation for hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.

        "D": "Rectal manometry"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario is suggestive of Hirschsprung's disease. A rectal biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease. A rectal biopsy 2 cm above the dentate line is the ideal area for a biopsy. Hirschsprung's disease is a developmental disorder characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the myenteric (Auerbach) plexus and submucosal (Meissner) plexus. Most infants present with abdominal distention and bilious emesis with failure to pass meconium within the first 24 hours of life. The initial investigation is a contrast enema. The area between the dilated and contracted segments is referred to as the transition zone. The affected part shows the absence of ganglion cells and hypertrophy of nerve trunks in the rectal biopsy. Other investigations for Hirschsprung's disease include: Water-soluble contrast enema - shows the presence of a contracted aganglionic rectum, transition zone, and a dilated normally innervated colon. Anorectal manometry - shows the failure of the relaxation of the internal anal sphincter. Definitive surgeries for Hirschsprung disease are as follows: Swenson procedure, where aganglionic bowel is removed and a coloanal anastomosis is performed. Duhamel procedure, where the aganglionic rectal stump is left in place and the ganglionated normal colon is pulled posterior. Soave procedure, where endorectal mucosal dissection is done within the aganglionic distal rectum. The ganglionated normal colon is pulled through the remnant muscular cuff, and a coloanal anastomosis is performed.",

        "D": "Most common heterotopic tissue is gastric mucosa"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Meckel's diverticulum is a true diverticulum, which extends from the antimesenteric side of the small bowel. The diverticula which contain all the layers of the intestine are called true diverticula. Meckel's diverticulum is caused by a failure of normal regression of the vitelline duct that develops during weeks 5-7 of gestation. The rule of 2's (Mnemonic for Meckel's diverticulum) : • 2 types of heterotopic mucosa (gastric & pancreatic) • 2% incidence • located within 2 feet of the ileocecal valve • approximately 2 inches in length • Usually symptomatic by 2 years of age. The most common presentation is painless, massive, lower GI bleed in children younger than 5 years. Meckel's diverticulum can be the lead point for ileoileal or ileocolic intussusception. A bleeding Meckel's diverticulum may be confirmed by a 99mTc-pertechnetate isotope scan to detect ectopic gastric mucosa. Surgical treatment is the definitive therapy for Meckel's diverticulum. A simple V-shaped diverticulectomy with transverse closure of the ileum is the ideal surgical approach.",

        "D": "This defect is a component of the Cantrell's pentalogy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Omphalocele is usually associated with other congenital anomalies, whereas gastroschisis is rarely associated with other congenital anomalies. Omphalocele refers to a congenital defect of the abdominal wall in which the bowel and solid viscera are covered by the peritoneum and amniotic membrane. During normal development of the human embryo, the midgut herniates outward through the umbilical ring and continues to grow. Between the 10th-12th week of gestation, the midgut returns to the coelomic cavity and undergoes proper rotation and fixation, along with the closure of the umbilical ring. If the intestine fails to return, the infant is born with the abdominal contents protruding directly through the umbilical ring, with an intact sac covering the abdominal viscera, termed an omphalocele. The sac is composed of an outer layer of amnion and an inner layer of peritoneum. It is seen in omphalocele and not in gastroschisis. Omphalocele can vary from a small defect with intestinal contents to a giant omphalocele in which the abdominal wall defect measures 4 cm or more in diameter. It may even contain liver. Omphalocele occurs in association with special syndromes such as: there is a 60% to 70% incidence of associated anomalies, especially cardiac anomalies (20-40% of cases) and chromosomal abnormalities. Exstrophy of the cloaca (vesicointestinal fissure), the Beckwith-Wiedemann constellation of anomalies (macroglossia, macrosomia, hypoglycemia, and visceromegaly and omphalocele), and the Cantrell's pentalogy (lower thoracic wall malformations like cleft sternum, ectopia cordis, epigastric omphalocele, anterior midline diaphragmatic hernia, and cardiac anomalies).",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The above image shows gastroschisis. Herniation of the liver is more commonly seen with omphalocele than gastroschisis. Gastroschisis represents a congenital anomaly characterized by a defect in the anterior abdominal wall. The abdominal contents protrude through this defect. It is the most common anomaly seen in babies born to mothers under 20 years of age. Unlike omphalocele, there is no overlying sac and the size of the defect is usually <4 cm. An orogastric tube is placed to decompress the stomach. For primary closure, bowel loops are reduced, fascia and skin are approximated. If the viscera cannot be reduced into the abdomen, a silo is placed at the bedside as shown in the image. The eviscerated intestines are reduced serially during 5 to 7 days, followed by operative fascial closure.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given clinical history of lower back pain, mass in the right lumbar region pointing towards the groin, and pain on passive extension of the ipsilateral hip is suggestive of a psoas abscess. Psoas abscess is a retroperitoneal abscess caused by various etiologies. Previously, tuberculosis of the spine was the most common cause, secondary to spreading infection from the digestive or urinary tract, which can cause psoas abscess. Nowadays, Crohn's disease is the most common cause. Patients present with flank pain, fever, and chills, malaise, and weight loss. They can have referred pain to the hip, groin, or knee. When the swelling extends across the groin and below the inguinal ligament along the course of the iliopsoas, it becomes cross-fluctuant across the inguinal ligament. Imaging is done by a CT scan, which shows a low-density mass with surrounding inflammation and infiltration of surrounding fat and gas or air-fluid levels. Treatment is done by percutaneous CT-guided drainage and appropriate antibiotics. Other options: Option A: Pyelonephritis is usually associated with a history of urinary tract infection and sudden onset of pain in the flank and hypochondrium, not the lumbar region. Option C: Appendicitis (retrocaecal) can present with pain on passive extension of the hip (psoas sign), but the presence of a mass in the right lumbar region pointing towards the groin makes it an unlikely diagnosis. Option D: Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency condition presenting with sudden onset pain in the scrotum, groin, and lower abdomen, tenderness, redness, and edema of the scrotal skin.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "A soft, painless, brilliantly transilluminant, fluctuating mass found in the posterior part of the neck in a child is most likely to be a cystic hygroma. Cystic hygroma is a lymph-filled sac that results from the obstruction of the lymph vessels during their development. It is most commonly present in the posterior triangle of the neck. The mass may be apparent at birth or may appear in early childhood due to the increased accumulation of lymph. Since the sac is filled with lymph, it is soft, fluctuating, and brilliantly transilluminant. Treatment: Aspiration of the contents, followed by excision once the sac or capsule gets thickened by fibrous tissue. Single cysts can be treated with sclerosing therapy. Commonly used sclerosants include OK-432 or Picibanil, which is a mixture of group A Streptococcus pyogenes strain, pure ethanol, interferon alpha-2a, and doxycycline. Complete excision is done in case of multiple cysts. Option B: A branchial cleft cyst also presents as a soft fluctuant swelling. It is present in the anterior neck and at the junction of the upper third and middle third of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Option C: Lipoma is less commonly seen in children. The swelling is non-fluctuant and when palpated, the edge slips under the finger. This is known as the slip sign. Option D: Cervical lymphadenopathy is seen in children with infections of the parotid and upper respiratory tract infections. On palpation, they are firm and non-fluctuant.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "A lateral neck mass in a pediatric patient, which is non-tender and present in association with freckles, and hyperpigmented skin patches (cafe-au-lait spots) is suggestive of a neural tumor, i.e., neurofibroma. Neurofibroma is a benign tumor arising from the connective tissue of the nerve containing ectodermal, neural, and mesodermal connective tissue components. It can be single or multiple. It is the most common intradural extramedullary spinal tumor. Neurofibromas can be local, generalized (von Recklinghausen's disease), or plexiform types. Patients present with mild pain or a painless swelling usually in the subcutaneous or cutaneous plane with tingling, numbness, and paresthesia along the distribution of the nerve. Complications of neurofibroma include cystic degeneration, erosion into deeper planes, cord compression, and paralysis (spinal neurofibroma) and sarcomatous changes. Treatment is excision under general or regional anesthesia. Indications for surgery in neurofibroma include symptomatic patients (pain and pressure symptoms), cosmetic problems, and malignant transformation (5%). Option A: Cystic hygroma is a type of congenital lymphangioma. This swelling is soft and partially compressible, which shows positive fluctuation and translucency test. Option B: Chemodectoma or carotid body tumor is a rare tumor, most commonly present in the fifth decade, and there is an association with pheochromocytoma. These patients usually present with a slowly enlarging, painless lump at the carotid bifurcation. Option D: A lipoma is a soft, painless swelling. It shows the characteristic slip sign and is freely mobile.",

        "C": "Barium studies",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given clinical vignette and the radiographic image showing the presence of an enlarged gastric gas bubble (single bubble) are suggestive of congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (CHPS). Ultrasound examination is the investigation of choice for this condition. Congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (CHPS) is characterized by abnormal thickening of the pylorus muscles in the stomach leading to gastric outlet obstruction. First-born male infants are at the highest risk. Infants usually present with projectile, non-bilious vomiting due to gastric outlet obstruction, most commonly between 3 and 6 weeks of age. An olive-shaped mass is palpable in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium. Visible peristalsis after feeding, moving from left to right, followed by projectile vomiting, may also occur. Metabolic abnormalities include hypokalemic, hypochloremic, metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria. Ultrasound examination confirms the diagnosis of congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (CHPS) in the majority of cases. The diagnostic criteria for pyloric stenosis are a muscle thickness of 4 mm and a pyloric length of at least 16 mm. Ultrasound signs seen in Congenital Hypertrophic Pyloric stenosis are: the target sign (hypoechoic thickened pyloric muscle with a hyperechoic central mucosa), the cervix sign, the nipple sign, and the antral nipple sign. The child should be rehydrated and the metabolic abnormality has to be corrected before proceeding to surgery. The Ramstedt pyloromyotomy is the standard surgical procedure for its treatment.",
