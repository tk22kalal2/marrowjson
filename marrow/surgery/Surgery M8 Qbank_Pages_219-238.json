      "explanation": "Mammography is best performed in the 1st half of the menstrual cycle, as breast tissue is lessdense in the follicular phase. Also, in the 2nd half of the menstrual cycle, since ovulation occursand there is a chance for pregnancy, the radiation can potentially affect the embryo.The sensitivity of mammography increases with age, as the breast tissue becomes less dense.It involves 2 standard views:Mediolateral oblique (MLO) view- covers a greater volume of breast tissue, including theouter quadrant and the axillary tail of Spence.•upperCraniocaudal (CC) view- provides better visualization of the medial aspect of the breast.Mammography uses low-voltage, high-amperage X-rays.

Mammography is more accurate than clinical examination forthe detection of early breast cancers. Mammographic features suggestive of breast cancer includea solid mass with or without stellate features, microcalcifications, irregular soft tissue shadow,spiculations and duct distortion.Statement 3: Pathological diagnosis of carcinoma is made by a core needle biopsy (tru-cut biopsy)or fine-needle aspiration before any type of treatment is started.Statement 4: The presence or absence of axillary lymph node involvement in breast cancer is oneof the most important prognostic factors for determining staging and treatment.Ultrasound-guided lymph node biopsy should be done in patients with suspicious or clinicallypalpable lymph nodes.Ultrasound features suggestive of breast cancer include a hypoechoic, irregular mass withindistinct, angulated or spiculated margins, acoustic shadowing, ductal extension and a branchedpattern of mass.",
