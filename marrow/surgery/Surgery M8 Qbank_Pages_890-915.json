Escherichia coli is the most common causativeorganism.Emphysematous pyelonephritis is associated with an acute necrotizing infection of the kidney bygas-producing organisms that occurs predominantly in diabetic patients. E. coli produces carbondioxide by the fermentation of sugar.Patients frequently present with sepsis and ketoacidosis. It can be associated with tenderness atthe costovertebral angle known as Murphy's punch sign.CECT abdomen shows an enlarged destructed renal parenchyma with small linear streaks of gas.Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics with drainage. In patients who fail to respond totreatment, nephrectomy is considered.Note: Clostridium species are the most common causative organisms in emphysematouscholecystitis.Murphy's punch sign is also seen in infection, inflammation, or obstruction of the kidney.

Liver, bone, and brain metastasis is rare.Wilms tumor or nephroblastoma is the most common primary malignant renal tumor ofchildhood. It is commonly seen in children between 2-5 years of age. More than one-third of thecases contain precursor lesions known as nephrogenic rests.Asymptomatic abdominal mass discovered incidentally is the most common presentation.Patients may also present with:• Abdominal pain• Gross painless hematuria.• Fever• HypertensionMost unilateral tumors are treated by chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, anddactinomycin) followed by nephrectomy.Radical nephrectomy is the standard surgical procedure done. Partial nephrectomy is consideredif all the following conditions are met:.• The tumor involves only one pole of the kidneyNo evidence of collecting system or vascular involvement912• The involved kidney has an appreciable function• There are clear margins between tumor and surrounding structuresIt is done for children with bilateral disease or with a solitary kidney. Preoperative chemotherapycan be used in these cases to induce tumor shrinkage.",

      "explanation": "The clinical features of a ballotable renal mass with hematuria in a 3-year-old child are suggestiveof Wilms tumor and FNAC is not done in this condition.Investigations in suspected cases of Wilms tumor:• Laboratory study - shows hematuria, polycythemia, thrombocytosis, and elevated APTT• USG with doppler study of renal veins - for evaluation of the collecting system and to look fortumor thrombi in renal veins and inferior vena cava•• CECT abdomen - to identify the extent of the disease, to access the contralateral kidney, and formetastasis• MRI - not used routinely as it requires sedation• Positron emission tomography (PET) scan to identify regional spread and metastatic lesionsDiagnosis should be made by imaging studies and it is confirmed after nephrectomy. A biopsy isdiscouraged in this condition as it results in disease upstaging. Only in cases with atypicalpresentation such as older age, signs of infection, etc, or with unusual imaging findings a coreneedle biopsy via the posterior approach can be performed.Note: Neuroblastoma also presents similar to Wilms tumor. It is commonly seen in children ofpreschool age. Affected children commonly present with a palpable abdominal mass and the mostcommon site of the tumor is the retroperitoneum. Therefore, this disease becomes an importantdifferential diagnosis. So we should also test for the presence of vanillyl mandelic acid (VMA) inthis patient to exclude this tumor.",
