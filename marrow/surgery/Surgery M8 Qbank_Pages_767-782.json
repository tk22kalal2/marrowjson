      "explanation": "Injury to the right aberrant posterior sectoral duct associated with bile leak is classifiedas Strasberg's type C injury.Biliary injury may occur post-laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The most common site of bile leakfollowing cholecystectomy is the cystic duct.MRCP is the gold standard for complete morphological evaluation of the biliary tree. MRCP withmagnetic resonance angiography is more useful in cases of associated vascular injury. A HIDAscan can confirm the presence of a bile leak or biliary obstruction.The Strasberg classification of bile duct injury is widely used to anatomically define bile ductinjuries.Classification• Type A: Bile leak from cystic duct stump or a minor biliary radical in the gallbladder fossa•Type B: Occluded right posterior sectoral duct.• Type C: Bile leak from the divided right posterior sectoral duct.• Type D: Bile leak from the main bile duct without major tissue loss.•Type E: Injury to the main hepatic duct; classified according to the level of injury• E1: Transected main bile duct with a stricture more than 2cm from the hilus.• E2: Transected main bile duct with a stricture less than 2cm from the hilus.• E3: Stricture of the hilus with right and left ducts in communication.• E4: Stricture of the hilus with separation of right and left hepatic ducts.• E5: Stricture of the right aberrant sectoral and main bile ducts.773Strasberg classification of bile duct injuriesfrom the oystig duotOoolssion of the biliarywith noBile inak from right aberranthepatioductsmon than 2 omInjury loan than 2 omCOinjury to the mainrightduotRED NARROWManagement of bile duct injuries is shown below:Management of bile duct injuriesAssess the type of injuryPartial injuryto thebile duct (3mm)Repairthe injuryComplete transectionwithout lossof a segmentAnastomoseover T-tubeIf the injury is identifiedduring the surgeryinjuComplete transectionwith lossof segmentClose distal end andcarry out Roux-en-Yhepatico duodenostomyjejunostomyDo transabdominal USG to assess the leakIf the patient presentswithin 48 hoursRe-explorationand repairIf the patient presentsafter 48 hoursUSG guided aspiration orpigtail catheter insertionERCP and stentingIf the biliary leak issuspected postoperatively©MARROW",

      "explanation": "Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the best investigation in a patientsuspected of post-cholecystectomy biliary leaks.Patients with post-cholecystectomy biliary leak usually present with fever, jaundice andabdominal pain. USG is used for an initial evaluation in such cases and can show a collection inthe sub-hepatic space.The most common bile leak following cholecystectomy is from the cystic duct. This can be treatedby placing a biliary endoprosthesis (stent) in the common bile duct across the origin of the cysticduct.774MRCP shows fluid collections arising from bile leaks but cannot differentiate these from othercauses of fluid collections.ERCP is the best investigation as it has the advantage of being both diagnostic andtherapeutic. ERCP is useful post-cholecystectomy as there is a high likelihood of a retained stoneand stone extraction and/or temporary stenting may be required.HIDA scan is the most sensitive investigation for biliary leakage.CT scan can show focal fluid collections, ascites, biliary obstruction, hepatic atrophy, signs ofsecondary biliary cirrhosis and any vascular injury.Management of bile duct injuriesAssess the type of injuryPartial injuryto thebile duct (3mm)Repairthe injuryComplete transectionwithout lossof a segmentComplete transectionwith lossof segmentAnastomoseover T-tubeIf the injury is identifiedduring the surgeryClose distal end andcarry out Roux-en-Youhepatico duodenostomyjejunostomyDo transabdominal USG to assess the leakIf the patient presentswithin 48 hoursRe-explorationand repairIf the patient presentsafter 48 hoursUSG guided aspiration orpigtail catheter insertionERCP and stentingIf the biliary leak issuspected postoperativelyOMARROW",

      "explanation": "Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the best investigation for thediagnosis of bilhemia.Bilhemia is a condition in which bile flows into the bloodstream through the hepatic veins orportal vein branches. This flow occurs due to a high intrabiliary pressure, exceeding that of thevenous system.The cause can be the erosion of gallstones into the portal vein, or accidental/iatrogenic trauma.This condition can be fatal secondary to the embolization of large amounts of bile into the lungs.Usually, bile flow is low, and the fistulas close spontaneously.Its clinical features include:• Rapidly progressive jaundice• Marked direct hyperbilirubinemia, without elevation of the hepatocellular enzyme levels.•Septicemia.Diagnosis of bilhemia is best made by ERCP.Treatment is directed at reducing the intrabiliary pressure through stent placement orsphincterotomy. Endovascular embolization can also be done.",

Cholangiohepatitis is a pre-malignant condition and can result in cholangiocarcinoma. Schistosoma haematobium primarily causes genitourinary schistosomiasis.

Inthe Kasai procedure, the occluded extrahepatic bile ducts are excised and a jejunal Roux loop isanastomosed to the hepatic hilum.Extrahepatic biliary atresia (EHBA) is defined as a partial or total absence of permeable bile ductbetween porta hepatis and the duodenum. It is due to inflammatory fibrosis of the biliary tree. Itleads to obstruction to bile flow thereby causing leaking of conjugated bilirubin into thecirculation.Associated anomalies include cardiac lesions, polysplenia, situs inversus, absent vena cava, and apreduodenal portal vein.HIDA scan is the investigation of choice for EHBA. Intraoperative cholangiogram is the goldstandard for diagnosis.Infants with biliary atresia, who do not achieve successful drainage after Kasai's procedure,require liver transplantation within the first year of life.
