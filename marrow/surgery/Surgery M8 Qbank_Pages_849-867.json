Patients are usually in theirseventh or eighth decade of life and present with abdominal pain or recurrent pancreatitis. This iscaused by the obstruction of the pancreatic duct by thick mucin. Some patients have symptomssecondary to pancreatic insufficiencies like steatorrhea, diabetes, and weight loss.IMPNs are of three types:• Branch-duct IPMN (BD-IPMN) - affects only the small side branches.
