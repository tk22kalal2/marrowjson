Itusually results from arterial disruption, especially of the middle meningeal artery. It lies behindthe pterion, which is the thinnest part of the skull.In EDH, the patient is initially unconscious from the concussive aspect of the head trauma. Thepatient then awakens and has a “lucid interval,\" while the hematoma sub-clinically expands. Asthe volume of the hematoma grows, intracranial pressure (ICP) increases, and the patient rapidlybecomes lethargic and herniates.Uncal herniation from an EDH classically causes ipsilateral third nerve palsy and contralateralhemiparesis.",

It is usually due to the rupture of bridging veins running from the cerebral cortex to thedural sinuses.The level of consciousness is usually impaired at presentation and may deteriorate further as thehematoma expands.Elderly and alcoholic patients are at a higher risk of acute SDH formation after head trauma dueto brain atrophy.Open craniotomy for the evacuation of acute SDH is indicated for the following:•• Thickness &gt;1 cm•Midline shift &gt;5 mm•Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) drops by two or more points from the time of injury tohospitalization.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to the rupture ofa berry aneurysm. It is an extrarenal manifestation of autosomal dominant polycystic kidneydisease.1014Clinical features of SAH:• Sudden-onset severe headache (thunderclap headache)• Rapid onset vomiting• Confusion or a lowered level of consciousness•Seizures• Meningitic features of neck stiffness and photophobia often develop over hours.The most common cause is trauma and is managed conservatively. The second most commoncause is a rupture of a berry aneurysm.CT scan is the investigation of choice. A hyperattenuating material is seen filling the subarachnoidspace. Most commonly this is apparent around the circle of Willis, on account of the majority ofberry aneurysms occurring in this region.A lumbar puncture should be performed if the CT scan fails to establish the diagnosis of SAH. Itwill show xanthochromic CSF.Delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND) is attributed to vasospasm of the cerebralvasculature typically developing 3-10 days following ictus. It is the main cause of a poor outcome.Management:.• Endovascular treatment (\"coiling\") is generally preferred over craniotomy and clipping foraneurysms amenable to this approach.• The combination of induced hypertension, hypervolemia, and hemodilution (Triple-H therapy) isoften utilized to prevent and treat cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage(SAH).Note: The combination of subarachnoid hemorrhage and vitreous hemorrhage (subhyaloid) isknown as Terson syndrome.1015",

      "explanation": "Delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND) usually occurs between 3 and 10 days after the SAH.It is a delayed complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage characterized by the fluctuating declinein consciousness and appearance of neurological deficits. It is attributed to ischemia resultingfrom reactive cerebral vasospasm. Patients with a larger blood load (in the subarachnoid space)are at higher risk of vasospasm.Medical management strategies aim to minimize secondary brain injury, through avoidance ofhypoxia and hypotension and control of ICP.The incidence of DIND can be lowered by prophylaxis with nimodipine (60 mg, 4 hourly) andhypervolemia (8 hourly normal saline).",

It is causedby damage to axons throughout the brain due to rotational acceleration and then deceleration.Axons may be completely disrupted and then retract, forming axon balls.Small hemorrhages can be seen in more severe cases, especially on MRI (investigation of choice).Hemorrhage is classically seen in the corpus callosum and the dorsolateral midbrain.

      "explanation": "Bulbocavernosus reflex is the first reflex to return after the spinal shock has resolved.It is elicited by squeezing the glans penis in males and applying pressure to the clitoris or pullingthe Foleys catheter in females. Any of these will lead to anal sphincter contraction.Spinal shock is a condition of transient physiologic reflex depression of spinal cord function.(motor, sensory, tone, reflexes) below the level of injury. It usually results from a high-impact,direct trauma to the spinal cord. When the level of injury is above T6, it can result inhemodynamic changes such as hypotension and bradycardia (due to loss of sympathetic tone andunopposed parasympathetic function).The resolution of spinal shock occurs over a period of days to months, when the areflexia slowlytransitions to hyperreflexia and spasticity. Reflexes return sequentially rather thansimultaneously. The resolution of the somatic component of spinal shock is classically signaled bythe return of the bulbocavernosus reflex, a polysynaptic cutaneous spinal reflex (mediated by theconus medullaris) which is then followed by monosynaptic deep tendon reflexes (e.g. ankle jerk).1017SqueezingclitorisBulbocavernosus reflexSqueezingglansAfferentpudendalS2-S4sacral centerRROOMARROWEfferentpudendalAnal sphinctercontraction",

While hyperventilation is an effective way of managing acute intracranialhypertension, it should be remembered that it can produce a dangerous decrease in cerebral bloodflow, especially if cerebral perfusion pressure is low.Primary brain injury (focal and diffuse) results from mechanical injury at the time of the trauma.Secondary brain injury is caused by the physiologic responses to the initial injury.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The use of antiepileptics in late post-traumatic seizure (PTS) patients is recommended.Post-traumatic seizures (PTS) are seizures that result from traumatic brain injury (TBI). They areclassified into early and late. Early PTS occurs within 1 week and late PTS occurs after 1 week oftrauma (Option C).Early PTS are acute symptomatic events, attributed to a direct reaction to injury and hemorrhage.Risk factors for early PTS are:•• Younger age (especially &lt;5 years)• Moderate to severe head injury (measured by GCS)•• Acute intracerebral hematoma• Subdural/Subarachnoid hemorrhage•Depressed skull fractures• Diffuse cerebral edema.•History of alcohol abuse•• Penetrating head injuryLate PTS usually occurs due to underlying permanent structural and physiologic changes withinthe brain. Patients with late PTS may develop post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). It refers to recurrentand unprovoked PTS that occur at least 1 week after TBI. Risk factors for PTE are:• Early PTS• Severe head injury• Older age (especially &gt;65 years)• Focal neurological deficit• Intracranial hemorrhage.• Intracranial infection• Abnormalities on EEG• Alcohol-related head injuryProlonged seizures (30 to 60 minutes) can cause secondary brain injury, not primary (Option B).Hence, it is imperative to control acute seizures as soon as possible.The initiation of antiepileptics in early PTS patients is to prevent damage due to seizuresthemselves. It does not reduce the likelihood of developing PTE (Option D). For patients whodevelop late PTS, because of the high risk of seizure recurrence after the first episode of late PTS,the use of antiepileptic medication is recommended even after a single late seizure episode. Thelong-term sequelae of head injury are headache, raised ICP, impaired short-term memory, lack ofconcentration, emotional disinhibition, and depression.1020Prophylaxis for PTS is indicated in patients at risk of early PTS, for 7 days and is stopped withouttapering the dose if no seizures have occurred during this duration.

It is one of the earliest signs of basilar fracture.• Periorbital ecchymosis (raccoon eyes): Pooling of blood surrounding the eyes, associated withfractures of the anterior cranial fossa.•⚫ Retroauricular or mastoid ecchymosis (Battle sign): Pooled blood behind the ears in the mastoidregion is associated with fractures to the middle cranial fossa.•⚫ CSF rhinorrhea or otorrhea: \"Halo\" sign, a double-ring pattern described with CSF-containingbloody fluid from the ear or nose, when dripped onto paper or linen.Battle sign and raccoon eyes are both typically not present during the initial evaluation and aredelayed by 6 hrs up to 3 days after head injury.CSF leaks may be delayed hours to days after the initial trauma. Fluid suspicious for CSF isconfirmed by testing for ẞ2 transferrin. Most CSF leaks are conservatively managed. Persistentleaks &gt;7 days have a heightened risk of meningitis and are often surgically repaired.Nasopharyngeal airways and nasogastric tube insertion are relatively contraindicated in basilarskull fractures due to the risk for intracranial placement. NIPPV is avoided due to the risk forpneumocephalus.The image below shows the 'battle' sign.1021The image below shows 'racoon' eyes.The image below shows pneumocephalus.",
