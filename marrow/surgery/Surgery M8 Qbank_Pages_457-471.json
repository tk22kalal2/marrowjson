      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of fever, tachycardia, and leucocytosis in a postoperative patient ofLSG should raise suspicion for leak along the gastric staple line. The next best step in themanagement of this patient is to perform a contrast-enhanced CT.Leaks following LSG most commonly occur in the proximal third of the stomach, close to theangle of His. Early leaks are due to tissue trauma and staple misfire, and late leaks are usually dueto ischemia and high intragastric pressure.Management of the leak involves providing nutritional support to the patient and adequatedrainage. Once the leak is diagnosed, the patient should be kept nil per oral.Total parenteral nutrition and antibiotic therapy should be started in the patient. Drainage can bedone either by CT-guided percutaneous catheter placement, endoscopic stenting, or operativeprocedures.Note: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor for an anastomotic leak. Treatment withcontinuous positive airway pressure might reduce this risk.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and radiograph (dilated bowel segments with valvulae conniventes inthe left upper quadrant) are suggestive of small bowel obstruction. Bariatric surgery, specifically,Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery is associated with the creation of mesenteric defects. The smallbowel can herniate through these defects (internal hernia) and get strangulated, resulting in bowelobstruction.In addition, as the person loses weight (due to the bariatric procedure), the protective,space-occupying effect of the mesenteric fat is lost and hernia spaces open up, further increasingthe risk of internal hernia. The laparoscopic procedure has a higher risk compared to opensurgery since fewer adhesions form to tether small-bowel loops and prevent them from467herniating.Adequate closure of the mesenteric defects by the surgeon at the time of operation significantlyreduces the risk of internal hernia.Other complications specific to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass:• Nutritional deficiencies: iron (most common), folate, Vitamin A, D, K and B12• Anastomosis site leak•Bleeding from the site of gastrojejunostomy• Dumping syndrome• Marginal ulcers•• Increased risk of DVT and pulmonary embolismOption A: Sleeve gastrectomy is often complicated by staple line leak.Option B: Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding is associated with band slippage and erosion.Option D: Endoluminal stapling is also used to create a gastric sleeve. It is associated withpostoperative nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and transient dysphagia.",
