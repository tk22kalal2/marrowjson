      "explanation": "The only indication for an adrenal gland biopsy is to confirm adrenal gland metastasis.An adrenal incidentaloma is defined as a clinically unapparent adrenal lesion that is incidentallydetected on imaging performed for indications other than evaluation for adrenal disease. Themajority of these lesions are non-functional tumours i.e. benign. The likelihood of an adrenalmass being an adrenocortical carcinoma increases with the size of the mass (25% chance if size&gt;4 cm).Incidentalomas are evaluated to classify them as functional and non-functional. Non-functionalincidentalomas &lt;4cm are managed conservatively with MRI surveillance every 3-6 months. If&gt;4cm, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is done.Note: An adrenal mass should never be biopsied until a pheochromocytoma has beenbiochemically excluded.",

      "explanation": "During selective adrenal vein sampling, a significant difference in the aldosterone-cortisol ratio onone side indicates unilateral hyperaldosteronism. In this case, unilateral laparoscopicadrenalectomy is the treatment of choice.Primary hyperaldosteronism (PHA) is characterized by hypersecretion of aldosterone withsuppressed plasma renin levels (due to the negative feedback). The most frequent cause of PHA isunilateral adenoma.CT or MRI is used to detect the tumour. In a patient with bilateral micronodular hyperplasia,there could be a unilateral non-functioning tumour. Selective adrenal vein sampling can be doneto differentiate between unilateral and bilateral disease.Conservative management with 3-6 months of MRI surveillance is done in non-functional adrenaltumours of &lt; 4cm.Medical management is done in patients with bilateral disease, the commonly implementedtherapeutic approach is treatment with spironolactone and antihypertensive medication.Surgical management is done in unilateral and asymmetrical bilateral disease by unilaterallaparoscopic adrenalectomy. A subtotal resection can be considered in the case of a typical singleConn's adenoma. However, it is not superior to unilateral adrenalectomy.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "359The rationale behind cortisol supplementation after the surgical removal of the adenoma is thatthere is suppression of the contralateral adrenal gland by the pre-operative elevated cortisollevels. This causes primary adrenal insufficiency.Patients undergoing unilateral adrenalectomy typically require exogenous steroids for up to ayear, which is usually the duration the remaining adrenal gland takes to recover adequatefunction. In bilateral adrenalectomy, steroids are required indefinitely, and patients may alsorequire mineralocorticoid replacement therapy.Option A: The remaining adrenal gland usually has sufficient reserve to maintain homeostasis.Option C: A deficiency of ACTH causes secondary adrenal insufficiency. However, the adrenalinsufficiency post adrenalectomy is primary i.e due to the hyposecretion of cortisol from the glanditself.Option D: Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome is a bilateral adrenal infarction associated withmeningococcal sepsis and is rapidly fatal unless immediately treated.",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of new-onset hyperpigmentation post-adrenalectomy is suggestiveof Nelson's syndrome. The first-line and definitive management is surgical resection of thepituitary adenoma.Nelson's syndrome is a rare complication of total bilateral adrenalectomy (TBA). TBA is aprocedure used to control hypercortisolism in Cushing's disease (due to ACTH-secreting pituitaryadenoma) when resection of the primary tumor is not possible.The loss of feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis following TBA increasesCRH. This leads to stimulation of ACTH-secreting corticotroph cells, causing enlargement of theoriginal pituitary tumor or formation of a new one.Nelson's syndrome is associated with a clinical triad of:• Hyperpigmentation• Excessive ACTH secretion• Corticotroph adenomaScreening is done with fasting plasma ACTH levels and MRI brain performed at regularintervals. Prophylactic pituitary irradiation may be recommended to prevent its incidence. Theprimary treatment is transsphenoidal surgery. Patients will also require life-long glucocorticoidreplacement, as they do not produce cortisol.The use of steroidogenic inhibitors in the treatment of Cushing's disease has decreased the needfor bilateral adrenalectomy these days.",

Classically, pheochromocytomas show a 'Swiss cheese' configuration.123 Iodine-MIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) single-photon emission computed tomography(SPECT) is essential for the detection of multiple extra-adrenal tumours and metastases, but PETscan using FDG or DOPA is more sensitive in detecting metastatic foci.The image given below shows MRI (marked B and C) and high uptake on 123I-mIBG scintigraphy(marked D and E)ABCDELaparoscopic resection is now a routine in the treatment of pheochromocytoma.An α-adrenoreceptor blocker, phenoxybenzamine, is used pre-operatively to block excesscatecholamine and its consequences during surgery.

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of hypotension with no presence of bleeding and bilateraladrenalectomy is suggestive of an Addisonian crisis. It is a life-threatening condition caused dueto sudden insufficiency of adrenal hormones.Acute adrenal insufficiency (adrenal or addisonian's crisis) is a medical emergency caused due to aprecipitating illness unmasking insufficiency or trauma or severe sepsis causing adrenalhemorrhage (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome) or surgical removal of the glands. It presentswith non-specific symptoms such as shock with fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,hypocalcemia and electrolyte imbalances. It may be often misdiagnosed as an acute abdominalemergency.Adrenal insufficiency can be primary (due to adrenal pathology), secondary (due to pituitarypathology- lack of ACTH) or tertiary (due to hypothalamus pathology- lack of CRH).Autoimmune adrenalitis is the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency worldwide.Tuberculosis is the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency in India.Adrenal crisis requires immediate intervention owing to its high mortality rate. Immediaterehydration is initiated with a saline infusion at 1 litre/hr with continuous cardiac monitoring.Glucocorticoid replacement is initiated with an initial bolus injection of hydrocortisone 100 mgfollowed by 200 mg over 24 hours, preferably by continuous infusion or alternatively by IV or IMinjections. Mineralocorticoid replacement is initiated once the daily dose of hydrocortisone hasbeen reduced to &lt;50 mg, since hydrocortisone at higher doses provides sufficient stimulation ofmineralocorticoids.",
