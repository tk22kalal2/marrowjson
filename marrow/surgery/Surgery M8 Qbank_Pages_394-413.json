      "explanation": "Protein increases the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure, thereby allowing the closure ofthe sphincter and reducing reflux.Other options:Option A: Chocolate and coffee both contain methylxanthine, which causes muscles to relax andlowers the LES pressure. In addition, coffee can stimulate gastric secretions, which can promotereflux.Option C: Fatty foods have been found to delay gastric emptying and decrease the LES pressure,thereby prolonging the esophageal exposure time to the stomach acid and the volume available forreflux.Option D: Alcohol, mint, citrus, tomatoes, and/or carbonated beverages may cause furtherirritation to the damaged esophageal mucosa but have not been found to cause reflux themselves.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with X-ray findings showing a retrocardiac gas bubble are consistentwith the diagnosis of a hiatus hernia. A CT scan with oral contrast is the best method ofdiagnosis. It highlights the gastric anatomy but also helps to identify other structures involved inthe hiatal hernia.Hiatus hernia is the protrusion of any abdominal structure other than the esophagus into thethoracic cavity through a widening of the hiatus of the diaphragm.Types of hiatus hernia:Type 1- sliding herniaGastroesophageal junction or cardia migrates into the thoracic cavity. The length of intraabdominal esophagus is reduced leading to GERD. Most of the patients are asymptomatic. Thetreatment of choice in symptomatic patients is fundoplication.Type 2- rolling hiatus hernia:Gastroesophageal junction or cardia is normal but a portion of the stomach migrates into thethoracic cavity. The length of the intraabdominal esophagus remains the same in a true rollinghiatus hernia.Clinical features:• Chest pain or fullness relieved on belching..⚫ Dysphagia.• Longitudinal ulcers (Cameron's ulcer) that bleed lead to anemia.Surgical reduction of hernia and tightening of diaphragmatic crura is the best treatment modalityeven in asymptomatic patients to avoid life-threatening complications like volvulus.Type 3- mixed hiatus hernia:A combination of sliding and rolling hiatus hernia. Treatment is the same as rolling hiatus hernia.Type 4 hiatus hernia:Other contents of GIT herniates into the thoracic cavity. Eg: Colon.402Types of Hiatal HerniaGastroesophagealjunctionType 1Sliding herniaNormalRType 3Mixed typeOMARROWType 2Rolling herniaType 4Paraesophageal herniaNote: This is a controversial question as some books give barium swallow as the investigation ofchoice for hiatal hernia.

      "explanation": "Mucus-secreting goblet cells (not foveolar cells) are characteristic of Barrett's esophagus, as thereis intestinal metaplasia of the esophagus. Foveolar cells are the mucus-secreting cells in thestomach.Barrett's esophagus is a complication of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and itis estimated to occur in about 10% of individuals with symptomatic GERD. Symptoms includeheartburn, regurgitation and sometimes dysphagia. Obese white men over the age of 60years represent the highest-risk group.Intestinal metaplasia in the esophagus occurs due to chronic irritation of the esophagus in GERD(option A) since intestinal epithelium is better suited to handling gastric acid exposure. Hence,mucus-secreting goblet cells are characteristic of Barrett's esophagus. Since all metaplasia arereversible, Barrett's esophagus is also reversible (option D). Only 0.2 to 1% of Barrett's esophagusleads to dysplasia and adenocarcinoma.Barrett's EsophagusGoblet cells(intestinal metaplasia)Alician blue is used in the staining of the biopsy specimen, as it stains the goblet cells (option C).Mucicarmine is the specific stain.Seattle protocol is used for the management of Barrett's esophagus.406Management of Barrett's Esophagus(Seattle Protocol)Seattle protocolBarrett's onlyDysplasiaMetaplasiaAblation ofabnormalmucosa- RFA- APCContinue2 yearly protocolCancerSurgery(esophagectomy)Low grade dysplasiaHigh grade dysplasia6 month protocolRFA3 month protocolRadiofrequency ablationAPCArgon photocoagulationOMARROW",
