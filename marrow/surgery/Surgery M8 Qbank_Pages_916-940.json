      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The congenital anomaly seen in the above image is exstrophy of the bladder (ectopia vesicae). It isassociated with epispadias, not hypospadias.Bladder exstrophy refers to herniation of the urinary bladder through an anterior abdominal walldefect. The bladder is open and exposed on the outside of the abdomen. The male to female ratiois 4:1. Chronic exposure of the bladder to the external environment can lead to adenocarcinoma ofthe bladder.The clinical features of bladder exstrophy include:•Separation of the pubic bones with non-united symphysis pubis•⚫ Epispadias925•In males: Broad and short penis and bilateral inguinal hernia• In females: Bifid clitorisManagement involves a staged surgical reconstruction of the bladder and genitalia. Closure of theabdominal and bladder wall is done in the first year of life. This often requires an iliacosteotomy to relax the tension on the bladder and repair the abdominal wall duringwound-healing.Later, reconstruction of the bladder neck, sphincters, epispadias, and other genital defects isdone.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with continuous dribbling of urine, in spite of regular voiding, issuggestive of an ectopic ureter.Ectopic ureter is a congenital anomaly that occurs as a result of abnormal caudal migration of theureteral bud during its insertion into the urinary bladder. They are usually associated with duplexureters and drain from the upper pole of the kidney.It is more common in females. The ectopic ureter usually opens into the urethra, vagina, andperineum. Hence, female patients present with constant urinary dripping all day, even though thechild voids regularly (Paradoxical incontinence). It can cause hydroureteronephrosis andrecurrent UTI.In males, the ectopic ureter opens always above the external urethral sphincter. Hence they areusually continent. However, it can cause other complications such as orchitis and epididymitis.Management involves re-implantation of the ureter into the bladder to treat incontinence andpreserve renal functions. If the kidney is severely affected, partial nephrectomy is helpful.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of acute retention of urine, possibly because of benignprostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The next step would be to insert an 18-Fr Coudé catheter.In men, the BPH especially the middle lobe enlargement obstructs the insertion of Foley'scatherter. Hence, a Coude catheter is advised over suprapubic catetherization as the immediatenext step as larger Fr Coude catheter is helpful in negotiating past the angulation in the prostaticurethra.927(Note: In acute urine retention, urethral strictures should be suspected when there is resistance atthe urethral meatus as the strictures are more common in distal urethra than proximal urethra)Bladder outlet obstruction is usually the most common cause of acute retention of urine. Itsclinical features include:•Inability to pass urine• Severe suprapubic pain• A distended, palpable, and tender bladderAcute urinary retention is managed by placing a urethral catheter as early as possible. Usually inBPH, smaller catheters will not pass through the angulation of the prostatic urethra as they areflexible and kink. Hence in BPH, the Coudé-tip catheter, which has a rigid and angulated tip, canbe used to overcome the urethral obstruction.If urethral catheter placement is not successful, suprapubic catheterization should be done.If there is a urethral stricture, a council tip catheter is used to dilate it using a cystoscope, guidewires, and urethral dilators.Urinary catheterStraight tip catheterMARROWCoude tip catheterOMARROW",

        "D": "Inflate with 20ml of water and under USG guidance, locate and prick the balloon"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "USG-guided rupture of the balloon percutaneously after inflating it with 20ml water should be thenext step of management.The failure of the balloon to deflate may be caused by:•Faulty valve mechanism• Blockage of the inflation channel by debris•Crystallization of the fluid within the balloon (when saline is used)The next best step in the management of a retained Foley's catheter is to further inflate theballoon with 20mL of water, following which the inflated balloon is ruptured percutaneously with928a needle under USG guidance.A suprapubic approach is used in males, while in females, either a transurethral or transvaginalroute can be used. A cystoscopy should be done to ensure that all fragments are removed.Other methods of approach include cutting the sidearm of the catheter, thereby disabling thevalve mechanism, or advancing a ureteric stylet or fine-gauge wire through the inflation port todislodge debris or puncture the balloon. But these are often unsuccessful.Option A: CT is not routinely used in most settings with retained Foley's.Option B: Injection of ether through the balloon port causes the rupture of the balloon withinseconds. But this technique causes significant bladder irritation.Option C: Balloons should not be overinflated until they rupture. This may cause severe pain andcould cause bladder rupture.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with normal urinalysis and cystoscopy findings are suggestiveof interstitial cystitis.Interstitial cystitis is a persistent, painful form of chronic cystitis, occurring most frequently inwomen. It is also known as chronic pelvic pain syndrome or bladder pain syndrome. Its clinicalfeatures include:• Severe suprapubic pain•Urinary frequency•Urgency• Hematuria• Dysuria without evidence of bacterial infectionCystoscopic findings seen in bladder mucosa are:• Fissures• Punctate hemorrhages (glomerulations)•• Ulcerations in the fundus of the bladder (Hunner's ulcer)The image shows Hunner's ulcer seen in interstitial cystitis:936Treatment options include:• Conservative - Patient education about the chronicity of the condition, behavioral modification(timed voiding, bladder training), stress reduction, dietary alteration (avoidance of caffeine andspicy and acidic foods) and physical therapy should be the initial management for all patients.• Pharmacological - Neuropathic analgesics (e.g. amitriptyline, pregabalin) are used for those witha significant pain component, whereas antimuscarinics and ẞ3-agonists are used for frequency,nocturia and urgency symptoms.•-Surgical For those with Hunner lesions, fulguration or laser to these lesions can be beneficial.Cystodistension as a treatment has variable evidence for success. If these options fail to improvesymptoms major surgical reconstruction can be considered in selected cases.Option b: Malakoplakia is a distinct form of inflammatory reaction seen in chronic cystitis. Itappears as soft, yellow, slightly raised mucosal plaques.Option d: Cystitis cystica occurs due to chronic irritation of the bladder mucosa. Cystoscopyreveals cystic lesions in the bladder.",

It is associated with dysplastic renal tissue.Ureterocele:A ureterocele is the cystic enlargement of the intramural ureter. It is thought to be caused due toureteric orifice atresia. It is observed more in females than males in a 4:1 preponderance andis bilateral in about 10% of the cases. They are similar to ectopic ureters wherein the upper pole ofthe kidney is drained. This condition is typically associated with dysplastic and non-functionalrenal tissue.Clinical presentation:•Children with ureterocele usually present with infection.• Adults present with renal stones.Diagnosis:• IVU shows a classical cobra head sign but is relatively infrequently performed these days..Cystoscopy shows a bulging, translucent swelling involving the ureteric orifice where there isurinary stasis. It is emptied by ureteric peristalsis.Treatment:•Surgical excision with re-implantation of the ureter is the treatment of choice for simpleureterocele.• Renal stones associated with ureterocele are removed using an endoscopic incision• An advanced disease that causes hydronephrosis or pyonephrosis is an indication fornephrectomy.",
