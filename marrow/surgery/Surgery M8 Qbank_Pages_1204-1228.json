      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Most cases of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are unilateral. It is bilateral in only 30% of theindividuals.DVT refers to thrombosis of the deep venous system.Caused by:••Postoperative thrombosis (most common cause)• Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs)• After childbirth• ImmobilitySites:• Pelvic veins-common• Leg veins―common in femoral and popliteal veins (common on the left side).Fever is the earliest symptom, which is also most commonly accompanied by pain and tendernessin the calf and thigh (option C).The following signs could be elicited:•Positive Homan's sign: Resistance of calf muscles on passive foreceful dorsiflexion of the foot.• Mose's sign: Gentle squeezing of the lower part of the calf from side to side is painful.• Neuhof's sign: Thickening and deep tenderness seen on deep palpation of the calf muscles.Sometimes, the thrombus may get dislodged and present as pulmonary thromboembolism (optionD) with features of dyspnoea, tachypnoea, and chest pain.Clinical features are unreliable for making a definitive diagnosis (option A), and a venous Doppleris the best modality for confirming DVT. It reveals a non-compressible dilated vein. The likelihoodof pulmonary embolism can be predicted using modified Wells criteria.Patients with DVT should be immediately started with subcutaneous low molecular weightheparin (LMWH). If contraindicated due to renal insufficiency or thrombocytopenia-relatedconditions, they should be started on fondaparinux (indirect factor Xa inhibitor) or bivalirudin(direct thrombin inhibitor). Anticoagulants should be administered for a minimum period of 31214months. Vena cava filters are used in patients with bleeding risks (like hemophilia).",

It is due toileofemoral deep vein thrombosis.It is usually seen in pregnant women and in individuals at risk of developing deep veinthrombosis. They typically present with painful, oedematous, and pale lower limb that blanches totouch. The lack of cyanosis differentiates this entity from phlegmasia cerulea dolens.In phlegmasia alba dolens, the thrombosis involves only major deep venous channels of theextremity, thus sparing collateral veins. The venous drainage is decreased but still present.In phlegmasia cerulea dolens, the thrombosis extends to collateral veins, resulting in severevenous congestion with massive fluid sequestration and more significant edema.Both phlegmasia cerulea dolens and phlegmasia alba dolens results from acute massive deep veinthrombosis and can be complicated by venous gangrene.Edema of pregnancy does not present with pain in the lower limbs but edema due to pressureexerted by the gravid uterus on the iliac veins.1215",

      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Heparin, especially low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is more effective for prophylaxis ofDVT in patients who have undergone major surgeries where early ambulation is not possible.The choice of prophylaxis depends on the type of surgery, trauma, and duration of postoperativeimmobilisation. Major trauma, abdominal and orthopaedic surgeries warrant a longer duration ofpostoperative immobilisation. So, the pharmacological method is preferred in these situations.Mechanical methods are advised in patients who are expected to be up and walking within 24 to48 hours such as after minor trauma. The simplest method is for the patient to ambulate. Theactivation of the calf pump mechanism is an effective means of prophylaxis.Additionally, compression stockings are advised. It can reduce the risk of DVT by exertinggraduated pressure on the leg, with the pressure being greatest at the ankle.Advantages of LMWH over unfractionated heparin:•⚫ LMWH has a longer plasma half-life and significantly higher bioavailability.• The consistent bioavailability and clearance of LMWH do not require monitoring of aPTT oranti-factor Xa activity.• Dosing is merely based on the patient's weight.• There is a more predictable anticoagulant response than with unfractionated heparin.LMWH inhibits factor Xa and not IIa activity, with the ratio of anti-factor Xa to anti-factor IIaactivity ranging from 1:1 to 4:1.",

It can lead to tender and erythematous rashes.Migratory thrombophlebitis is seen in:• Pancreatic cancer (most common)•• Lung cancer• Gastrointestinal cancer••Ovarian cancerProstate cancer• LymphomaNote: Trousseau's sign is seen in hypocalcemia where there is an involuntary contraction of themuscles of the hand and wrist when a blood pressure cuff is placed on the arm and inflated to20mm of Hg above systolic blood pressure.",

      "explanation": "The patient has axillary-subclavian vein thrombosis. Hypercoagulable states lead to secondaryaxillary vein thrombosis.Axillary-subclavian vein thrombosis (ASVT) is of 2 types.1224Primary ASVT occurs as a result of compression of the subclavian vein in the costoclavicularspace by repeated contraction of muscles that surround the thoracic outlet. There is repeatedcompression and traumatization to the vein. This leads to the formation of clots. It is also knownas:• Paget-Schrotter Syndrome• Venous thoracic outlet syndrome• Effort thrombosisSecondary ASVT occurs due to venous injury by indwelling central venous catheters, externaltrauma or pacemaker wires. It is also seen in hypercoagulable states.Symptoms and signs include pain, edema, and cyanosis of the upper extremity. Significantsuperficial venous distension can be seen in arm, forearm, shoulder and anterior chest wall.Doppler study is the investigation of choice. Anticoagulation is initiated once ASVT is diagnosedto prevent pulmonary embolism. In severe cases, thrombolytic therapy is done using tissueplasminogen activator (rtPA) or streptokinase.Adjuvant procedures following thrombolytic therapy may include balloon angioplasty for residualvenous narrowing and cervical or first rib resection for thoracic outlet abnormalities.",

Marjolin's ulcer is a type of squamous cell carcinoma seenin chronic long-standing venous ulcers.Management of venous ulcers:•• Bisgaard's regimen• Education• Elevation of the affected limb to reduce the edema• Elastic compression stockings - The ideal interface pressure in venous ulceration is 35-40mmHg.• Evaluation• 4 layer bandaging system comprising of:• Orthopedic wool• Cotton crepe• Elastic bandage - first compressive layer• Cohesive bandage second compressive layer-• Antibiotics are given only if the wound is infected.• Regular dressing.1226•Medical management by oral pentoxifylline is considered which helps in reducing the viscosityand improving circulation.•Surgery Ulcer excision with pinch mesh grafting has a good outcome and helps in preventingrecurrence.",

      "explanation": "The gradual filling of veins from below upwards indicates the perforator incompetence. BrodieTrendelenberg test is performed to test for the incompetence of the saphenofemoral valve and thecommunicating system.1. Trendelenburg's test - Lay the patient down and elevate the leg. Empty the vessels and tie atourniquet below the SFJ. Ask the patient to stand up:• Trendelenburg's test part 11 - Here the tourniquet is not released. A gradual filling from below toupwards indicates perforator incompetence.1227•Trendelenburg's test part 1 - Here the tourniquet is released. A rapid filling from above shows thesaphenofemoral incompetence.2. Morrisey's cough impulse: the patient is asked to cough. A cough impulse at thesaphenofemoral junction indicates SFJ incompetence.3. Schwartz test: If a thrill is felt at SFJ on tapping over the incompetent vein, indicates SFJincompetence.4. Modified Perthes test: A tourniquet is tied below SFJ and the patient is asked to walk. Anincrease in pain and prominence of dilated veins indicate DVT.5. Fegan's method - Mark the places of excessive bulges within the varicosities. Ask the patient tolie down and empty the varicose vessels. Palpate along the marked area to look for gaps and pitsin the deep fascia, which indicates perforator incompetence.1228",
