      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The most common site of gastric adenocarcinoma in the Asian population is the antrum. This isbecause H. pylori infections are relatively more prevalent in Asian countries and are associatedwith carcinoma of the body and distal stomach than the proximal stomach.However, in western countries, the proximal stomach is the most common site. This is attributedto a lesser prevalence of untreated H.pylori infections and a greater burden of chronic GERD andobesity in western countries.448",
