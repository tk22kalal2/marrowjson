      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "If the stone is proximal to the lingual nerve, stone retrieval can be done via an intraoral surgicalapproach under general anesthesia.80% of submandibular stones are radio-opaque. Conventional radiography is useful in the initialworkup of salivary stones, but ultrasound, CT, MRI, and sialendoscopy are required for accuratediagnosis and localization (especially for smaller and parenchymal stones).The only contraindication for sialendoscopy is acute sialadenitis. This is because sialendoscopyand ductal dilation is more difficult in the setting of inflammation and there will be a greaterlikelihood of ductal trauma and potential spread of infection.Management of sialolithiasis should begin with conservative measures, oral hydration, analgesia,massaging of gland, sialogogues, and antibiotics (if there are signs of infection). If unsuccessful,the next step is based on the sialolith's size, number, and location:•Small stones (&lt;4mm) - endoscopic removal using Dormia basket.1039•-larger stones external shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) + fragment removal or Open surgery andstone removal•Surgical excision of the gland should always be a last resortIf distal to lingual nerve: Make a longitudinal incision over the duct.

      "explanation": "A slowly progressive swelling, with a variable consistency, lifting the ear lobe, is suggestive ofpleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland.Pleomorphic adenoma, the most common benign salivary gland tumor, primarily affects theparotid gland, particularly its superficial lobe. It is also referred to as a mixed tumor due to itscombination of epithelial and mesenchymal components. This tumor most commonly occurs infemales around the age of 40.Clinical features:• Painless, slow-growing swelling• Lobulated, firm, variable in consistency• Lifts the earlobe• No facial nerve involvement• Curtain sign positive - cannot be moved above the zygomatic bone..• In case of deep lobe involvement, tonsils, and faucial pillars will be pushed medially.• Features of malignancy - a sudden increase in size, ulceration of the overlying skin, facial nervepalsy (involvement of facial nerve), painful swelling, and restriction of jaw movements.Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is the investigation of choice in diagnosing pleomorphicadenoma. Open biopsy is contraindicated due to the chances of injury to the facial nerve.All tumors of the superficial lobe of the parotid gland should be managed by superficialparotidectomy. Radical parotidectomy is performed for malignant pleomorphic adenoma.Other options:Option A: Adamantinoma is a low-grade malignant tumor that usually presents with pre-tibialpain and swelling since it most commonly affects the tibial diaphysis.Option B: Dermoid cysts present as firm painless subcutaneous nodules and are of 4 types:1042•Sequestration dermoid - sequestration of epithelium during embryological development.• Tubulodermoid - accumulation of secretions from ectodermal tube/duct•Implantation dermoid - implantation of the epidermis due to trauma• Teratomatous dermoid - having all 3 germ layers (ecto, meso, and endoderm)Option D: Sebaceous cysts are retention cysts of the sebaceous glands that present as smooth,non-tender, non-transillumination swelling with a punctum (in 70% of the patients).",

It commonlydevelops after parotid surgery. It is caused by an aberrant regeneration of post-ganglionicparasympathetic nerve fibers crossed along the sympathetic pathways to the sweat glands near theparotid region.Clinical features are due to the result of salivary stimulation (by the smell or taste of food) leadingto the sweating and flushing of the periauricular region on the involved side of the face. A starchiodine test is used for diagnosis.Treatment ranges from antiperspirants (in mild cases) to tympanic neurectomy or botulinumtoxin injection (in severe cases).

The main trunk passes over the sternocleidomastoid and into theanterosuperior portion of the parotid glands and branches into the anterior and posterior GAN.The anterior branch of GAN is often injured during parotid surgery during the initial elevation ofthe skin flap.When GAN is injured, it can cause reduced sensations in the earlobe, pre-auricular skin, and theangle of the mandible that can interfere with habits such as shaving, wearing earrings, etc.1049Greateroccipitalnerve (C2)Third occipitalnerve(C3)Lesser occipitalnerve (C2)C4Greater auricularnerveInnervation of the scalpVertexOMARROWOpthalmicnerve (V1)SupratrochlearnerveSupraorbitalnerveZygomaticotemporalnervesMaxillary nerve (V2)AuriculotemporalnerveMandibularnerve (V3)Other options:Option A: The auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the mandibular nerve (V3 of trigeminal)supplies the posterior part of the temple, tragus, and adjoining auricle.

This avoids a lip-splitting incision but has thedisadvantage of anesthesia of chin/lower lip (due to the sacrifice of submental nerves).The surgical approach selected for excision of oral cavity tumors depends on the size of the tumor,location (anterior vs posterior), proximity to bone (mandible or maxilla), and the need to performneck dissection. The most commonly employed approaches are as follows:• Peroral accessible early-stage tumors-• Lower cheek flap - tumors requiring partialmandibulectomy or large posterolateral tumors that cannot be accessed via a peroral approach1053•• Upper cheek flap - tumors requiring partial maxillectomy or those involving the hard palate,upper gum, upper gingivobuccal sulcus and anterior soft palate• Mandibulotomy -larger tumors of the posterior oral cavity, tumors that involve the base of the tongueor pharyngeal wall.• Visor flap - larger lesions of the anterior oral cavity involving the anterior floor of the mouth andlower gum that are not amenable to a peroral approachCommando operation is the combined mandibular resection and neck node dissection.

      "question": "Detailed ExplanationsThe most common site for salivary gland stone formation is the submandibular gland due tohighly viscous secretions.80% of submandibular stones are radio-opaque, while parotid duct stones are usually radiolucentand rarely visible on plain radiography. Parotid gland sialography is usually required to identifythe stone. A stone located in the collecting duct or within the gland may be managed by eitherendoscopic retrieval or lithotripsy; in rare cases, surgical removal via a parotidectomy approachmay be required.The below USG image shows a stone in the Wharton duct of the submandibular gland.MI: 1,0Solution to Question 2:If the stone is proximal to the lingual nerve, stone retrieval can be done via an intraoral surgicalapproach under general anesthesia.80% of submandibular stones are radio-opaque. Conventional radiography is useful in the initialworkup of salivary stones, but ultrasound, CT, MRI, and sialendoscopy are required for accuratediagnosis and localization (especially for smaller and parenchymal stones).The only contraindication for sialendoscopy is acute sialadenitis. This is because sialendoscopyand ductal dilation is more difficult in the setting of inflammation and there will be a greaterlikelihood of ductal trauma and potential spread of infection.Management of sialolithiasis should begin with conservative measures, oral hydration, analgesia,massaging of gland, sialogogues, and antibiotics (if there are signs of infection). If unsuccessful,the next step is based on the sialolith's size, number, and location:•Small stones (&lt;4mm) - endoscopic removal using Dormia basket.1039•-larger stones external shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) + fragment removal or Open surgery andstone removal•Surgical excision of the gland should always be a last resortIf distal to lingual nerve: Make a longitudinal incision over the duct. Remove the stone. Suture theduct using absorbable suture.If proximal to lingual nerve: intraoral approachThe image below shows a stone in the submandibular salivary duct.Solution to Question 3:The given clinical scenario and FNAC report of acinar hypertrophy are suggestive of sialadenosis.Hyperthyroidism is not associated with sialadenosis.Sialosis (sialadenosis) is defined as an asymptomatic, non-inflammatory, non-neoplasticparenchymal salivary gland disease. It is accompanied by a persistent painless bilateral swelling ofthe salivary glands, most commonly involving the parotid glands. Most cases of sialadenosis areobserved in patients between 40 to 70 years of age, and the salivary gland swellings are often softand symmetrical. On FNAC, acinar cell hypertrophy is seen without any inflammatory signs.Sialadenosis is associated with the following conditions:• Nutritional disorders•Bulimia nervosa• Vitamin deficiency• Endocrine disorders• Diabetes mellitus•Hypothyroidism1040• Metabolic disorders• Obesity• Cirrhosis• Malabsorption•••• Autoimmune disordersSjögren disease• Drug-induced• Valproic acid• Thiourea• Pregnancy• AlcoholismSolution to Question 4:The given orthopantomogram shows a right-sided clearly demarcated radiolucent lesionsuggestive of a stafne bone cyst. It is the most common type of ectopic salivary tissue.It presents as an asymptomatic, clearly demarcated radiolucent lesion at the angle of themandible, characteristically below the inferior dental neurovascular bundle. It is more common inmales. Usually, no treatment is required.A dentigerous cyst is a cyst in relation to an unerupted tooth. Most commonly involves the 3rdmolar. It is managed by enucleation and removal of the tooth.Solution to Question 5:The given scenario and image points to a diagnosis of an oral ranula. It is a mucous extravasationcyst arising from the sublingual gland.Ranula is a transilluminant mucocele. It is also known as \"frog's belly\", as it resembles the vocalsacs of a frog. It is of two types:• Oral ranula - It is a benign cystic lesion formed by extravasation of mucus, involving thesublingual gland. Clinically present as cystic swelling in the floor of the mouth. On examinationfluctuation test and transillumination test is positive. It is conservatively managedby marsupialisation. Definitive management is excision of the cyst. Some may resolvespontaneously.• Cervical or plunging ranula- is a rare type of retention cyst arising from the sublingual gland.The mucous passes through the mylohyoid muscle diaphragm to enter the neck. Clinically presentas intraoral and cervical swelling. Diagnosis is made by USG or MRI. Management includesexcision of sublingual gland + aspiration of saliva out of the sac.1041Note: Oral ranulas located in the floor of the mouth can often be confused with an epidermoidcyst.Solution to Question 6:90% of the minor salivary gland tumors are malignant, and the common sites are the upper lip,palate, and retromolar regions.Option B: The most common site for salivary tumors is the parotid gland, mostly involving thesuperficial lobe.Option C: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor of the salivary gland.Option D: Adenoid cystic carcinoma is known to be associated with perineural invasion.Solution to Question 7:A slowly progressive swelling, with a variable consistency, lifting the ear lobe, is suggestive ofpleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland.Pleomorphic adenoma, the most common benign salivary gland tumor, primarily affects theparotid gland, particularly its superficial lobe. It is also referred to as a mixed tumor due to itscombination of epithelial and mesenchymal components. This tumor most commonly occurs infemales around the age of 40.Clinical features:• Painless, slow-growing swelling• Lobulated, firm, variable in consistency• Lifts the earlobe• No facial nerve involvement• Curtain sign positive - cannot be moved above the zygomatic bone..• In case of deep lobe involvement, tonsils, and faucial pillars will be pushed medially.• Features of malignancy - a sudden increase in size, ulceration of the overlying skin, facial nervepalsy (involvement of facial nerve), painful swelling, and restriction of jaw movements.Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is the investigation of choice in diagnosing pleomorphicadenoma. Open biopsy is contraindicated due to the chances of injury to the facial nerve.All tumors of the superficial lobe of the parotid gland should be managed by superficialparotidectomy. Radical parotidectomy is performed for malignant pleomorphic adenoma.Other options:Option A: Adamantinoma is a low-grade malignant tumor that usually presents with pre-tibialpain and swelling since it most commonly affects the tibial diaphysis.Option B: Dermoid cysts present as firm painless subcutaneous nodules and are of 4 types:1042•Sequestration dermoid - sequestration of epithelium during embryological development.• Tubulodermoid - accumulation of secretions from ectodermal tube/duct•Implantation dermoid - implantation of the epidermis due to trauma• Teratomatous dermoid - having all 3 germ layers (ecto, meso, and endoderm)Option D: Sebaceous cysts are retention cysts of the sebaceous glands that present as smooth,non-tender, non-transillumination swelling with a punctum (in 70% of the patients).Solution to Question 8:The given clinical scenario is suggestive of pleomorphic adenoma. The treatment of choice issuperficial parotidectomy.Clinical features:•Painless, slow-growing swelling• Lobulated, firm, elastic-to-hard in consistency• Lift the ear lobe• Free from deeper structures• With no facial nerve involvement• Curtain sign positive - cannot be moved above the zygomatic bonePleomorphic adenoma involves the superficial lobe of parotid gland and should be managed bysuperficial parotidectomy.Types of Parotidectomy• If only the superficial lobe is involved:•Superficial parotidectomy - only superficial lobe removed. Usually done in benign conditions.• If both lobes are involved:• Total conservative parotidectomy - both lobes are removed but the facial nerve is preserved.• Total radical parotidectomy - both lobes and facial nerve removed.Sometimes it may undergo malignant transformation. The malignant form is mixed malignanttumor or carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (most aggressive salivary malignancy).Signs of malignant transformation• A rapid increase in size•Pain and ulceration.• Facial nerve involvement (LMN)• Lymph node involvement• Restricted jaw movements1043Solution to Question 9:The given clinical scenario and image are suggestive of Warthin's tumor. These tumors appear ashot spots on radionuclide scans because of the high mitochondrial content in oncocytes thatincorporate technetium-99m. The most common benign tumor of the parotid gland ispleomorphic adenoma.Warthin's tumor or papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum usually presents as a unilateraltumor. It is usually seen in the lower poles of the parotid and is commonly associated withsmoking. It occurs most often in elderly males. It has no malignant potential.Histology shows tumor cells lined by a double layer of neoplastic epithelial cells resting on thedense lymphoid stroma. FNAC is the preferred investigation. Superficial parotidectomy is thetreatment of choice.Warthin's tumor HPEOMARROWNote: Both pleomorphic adenoma and Warthin's tumors commonly present as unilateral tumors.A bilateral presentation is usually rare. However in rare cases, if there is a bilateral benign salivarytumor, the tumor is most likely to be a Warthin's tumor.Solution to Question 10:Godwin's tumor•Benign lymphoepithelial tumor of the salivary gland.• It is associated with CMV..• &lt; 5% shows malignancy - known as Eskimoma.Kuttner's tumor is chronic sclerosing sialadenitis of the submandibular gland.Oncocytoma (oxyphil adenom",

It is a slow-growing tumormost commonly involving the parotid and submandibular glands. Histology shows a swiss cheesepattern. The tubular type has the best prognosis, while the solid type has the worst.It has a deceptively benign histologic appearance characterized by indolent, locally invasivegrowth with a high propensity for local recurrence and distant metastasis. The most common siteof distant metastasis is the lung. Treatment involves removal of the gross tumor, with radiationtherapy for the microscopic disease.Solution to Question 12:Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor, while pleomorphicadenoma is the most common benign tumor of the parotid gland.Histological classification and incidence of tumors of salivary glands:NOS: Not otherwise specified.Benign TumorsIncidenceMalignant tumorsIncidencePleomorphic aden50%Mucoepidermoid carcin15%omaomaWarthin's tumor5-10%Adenocarcinoma (NOS)10%1045Benign TumorsIncideMalignant tumorsIncidencenceOncocytoma1%Acinic cell carcinoma5%Other adenomas5-10%Adenoid cystic carcino5%maBasal cell adenom 1-2%Malignant mixed tumor3-5%aCanalicular adeno 1%maDuctal papillomasSquamous cell carcino1%ma-Other carcinomas2%Solution to Question 13:The inferior belly of the omohyoid muscle is not used as an anatomical landmark for theidentification of the facial nerve trunk.There are two methods for localization of the facial nerve trunk:1. Anterograde method: In this method, the facial nerve trunk is identified based on theanatomical landmarks after it exits from the stylomastoid foramen. The anatomical landmarksinclude:• Conley's pointer is the inferior portion of the cartilaginous canal. The facial nerve trunk lies 1 cmdeep and inferior to its tip.• Posterior belly of digastric- The facial nerve lies superior to the upper border of the muscle.•Mastoid process- Upon drilling it, the nerve is identified proximally.• Squamotympanic fissure is a fissure in the temporal bone, which runs from TMJ to the tympaniccavity. The facial nerve runs through this fissure.•Styloid process- The facial nerve lies superficial to it.2. Retrograde method: In this method, the main branches of the facial nerve trunk are identifiedand are then traced proximally until the main tunk is identified. Some of the main branches thatare commonly used for tracing the facial nerve trunk include:• Buccal branch lies in relation to the parotid gland•Marginal mandibular branch lies in relation to the facial vessels• Temporal branchThe given image points to the facial nerve (marked by arrow).1046ParotidglandFacialnerve.Posteriorbelly ofdigastric.Localisation of facial nerve inparotid surgerySternocleidomastoid muscleEar canal-cartilageConley'spointerMastoid tipSolution to Question 14:Among the given options, only submandibular (Level I",

The other nodes that will be removed in the procedure will be upperjugular nodes (Level IIa and IIb).Selective neck dissection has been used in the treatment of patients with cancer of the upperaerodigestive tract (oral cavity, pharynx, larynx), cancer of the thyroid gland, cutaneousmalignancies, and cancer of the salivary gland. The type of selective neck dissection used variesdepending on the lymphatic drainage and metastatic pattern associated with the primarycancer site.Solution to Question 15:The inferior alveolar nerve is the nerve least likely to be affected by submandibular surgery.Nerves at risk for injury during removal of the submandibular gland include:•Marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve• Lingual nerve•Hypoglossal nerveAn important landmark in submandibular gland dissection is the posterior border of themylohyoid muscle. Once identified, it can be retracted to reveal the deep lobe of the gland. Thehypoglossal nerves lie deep to the submandibular capsule and should not be damaged duringintracapsular dissection. The facial artery is ligated twice during the surgery.1047LingualnerveSublingualglandGeniohyoidSublingualpapillaGenioglossusMedial pterygoidDigastric, anteriorbellySubmandibular glandMylohyoidSubmandibular ductRelations of submandibular glandOMARROWSolution to Question 16:The auriculotemporal nerve (V3 nerve) is involved in Frey's syndrome (gustatory sweating).Frey's syndrome is also known as Dupuy syndrome or auriculotemporal syndrome. It commonlydevelops after parotid surgery. It is caused by an aberrant regeneration of post-ganglionicparasympathetic nerve fibers crossed along the sympathetic pathways to the sweat glands near theparotid region.Clinical features are due to the result of salivary stimulation (by the smell or taste of food) leadingto the sweating and flushing of the periauricular region on the involved side of the face. A starchiodine test is used for diagnosis.Treatment ranges from antiperspirants (in mild cases) to tympanic neurectomy or botulinumtoxin injection (in severe cases). It can be prevented by incorporating careful extracapsulardissection and closure of the superficial musculoaponeurotic layer during parotidectomy.1048GreateroccipitalnerveThirdoccipitalnerveC4Innervation of the scalpLesser occipital nerveGreat auricular nerveVertexOMARROWSupratrochlear-nerve (V1)Supra-orbitalnerve (V1)-Zygomatico-temporalnerve (V2)-Auriculotemporal nerve (V3)Other options:Option A: Facial nerve is the 7th cranial nerve that supplies the muscles of the face, and results infacial paralysis if injured during parotidectomyOption B: Oculomotor is the 3rd cranial nerve which supplies the extraocular muscles. If injuredduring ophthalmic surgeries, it results in ocular paralysis and the eye pointing down and out.Option D: Glossopharyngeal nerve is the 9th cranial nerve and its injury causes loss of tastesensation from the posterior 1/3rd of the tongue.Solution to Question 17:After parotid surgery, the nerve involved in the loss of sensation while shaving is the greatauricular nerve.The great auricular nerve (GAN) originates from the second and third nerve roots of the cervicalplexus (C2-C3). It supplies the skin over the lower pinna, pre-auricular region, and angle of themandible (image below). The main trunk passes over the sternocleidomastoid and into theanterosuperior portion of the parotid glands and branches into the anterior and posterior GAN.The anterior branch of GAN is often injured during parotid surgery during the initial elevation ofthe skin flap.When GAN is injured, it can cause reduced sensations in the earlobe, pre-auricular skin, and theangle of the mandible that can interfere with habits such as shaving, wearing earrings, etc.1049Greateroccipitalnerve (C2)Third occipitalnerve(C3)Lesser occipitalnerve (C2)C4Greater auricularnerveInnervation of the scalpVertexOMARROWOpthalmicnerve (V1)SupratrochlearnerveSupraorbitalnerveZygomaticotemporalnervesMaxillary nerve (V2)AuriculotemporalnerveMandibularnerve (V3)Other options:Option A: The auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the mandibular nerve (V3 of trigeminal)supplies the posterior part of the temple, tragus, and adjoining auricle. It does not supply the areawhere a person is likely to shave. However, the injury to the auriculotemporal nerve resulting inaberrant regeneration would result in Frey's Syndrome (gustatory sweating).Option C: Though the facial nerve is the most common nerve affected during parotidectomy, anydamage would result in facial paralysis and not loss of sensation of the face.Option D: The mandibular nerve is a branch of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) that suppliesthe skin over the mandible, lower lip, and cheek. However, they are not injured duringparotidectomy.Solution to Question 18:The given image shows a unilateral cleft lip. Repair of cleft lip (primary palate) along withassociated nasal deformities is done at 3-6 months of age.Solution to Question 19:Wardill's method is not a method of cleft lip repair. It is a technique for hard palate closure.Cleft-lip repair techniques:• Millard's rotation advancement technique (most common)• Thompson• Le Mesurier• Tennison-Randall1050Techniques of hard palate closure include the use of the following:• Unipedicled hard palate mucoperiosteal flaps as in the Wardill-Veau-Kilner repair.• Bipedicled hard palate mucoperiosteal flaps as in the von Langenbeck repairSolution to Question 20:Speckled erythroplakia has a high risk of malignant transformation.Malignancy risk:High-risk lesionsErythroplakia (homogenous/speckled)•Seen as red velvety lesions•Speckled type is the most aggressive•The treatment of choice is surgical ablationProliferative verrucous leucoplakia• A white patchy lesion that cannot be rubbed off.••Speckled leucoplakia has an erythematous baseThe treatment of choice is excisionChronic hyperplastic candidiasis• White patches that can be rubbed off with a hyperaemic border.• Management includes prolonged treatment with topical antifungals or systemic antifungaltherapy.

It is a premalignant lesion of the oral cavity,in which fibrous bands are formed beneath the oral mucosa.Risk factors are• Betel nut• Chilli• Tobacco• Vitamin deficiencyClinical features include ankyloglossia, trismus, soreness, and a burning sensation in the mouthwhile eating.Management includes intralesional steroids, vitamin supplements, and surgical excision.Option A: Plummer-Vinson syndrome is characterized by post cricoid web that is associated withiron deficiency anemia, glossitis, and koilonychia. It usually presents as dysphagia.Option B: Proliferative verrucous leucoplakia appears as a white patchy lesion, that cannot berubbed off.Option D: Erythroplakia is seen as bright red velvety plaque in the oral cavity.Solution to Question 22:1052The TNM staging in this patient is T4bN3bMX. A 7-cm primary tumor in the oral cavity withdifficulty in opening mouth denotes a locally advanced tumor: T4b. Contralateral cervical lymphnode involvement with skin involvement (extranodal extension-positive): N3bNote: Here the skin invasion corresponds to ENE positive, and hence, the N staging is N3binstead of N2c (contralateral lymph nodes, &lt;6 cm and ENE negative).Solution to Question 23:The image shows Weber-Ferguson incision which is used to access the floor of the maxillary sinusin the case of maxillary carcinoma.The rest of the options are incisions used for modified radical neck dissection (MRND).Incisions for modified radicalneck dissection (MRND)Crile's incisionMartin's incisionHockey stick incisionMacFee incisionMARROWSolution to Question 24:The given image shows the visor approach.In the visor approach, an incision is made extending from one end of the mandible to the oppositeside and subplatysmal flaps are elevated superiorly over the mandible (like a visor of a helmet).This approach provides a wide exposure to remove larger lesions involving the anterior oralcavity that is not amenable to a peroral approach. This avoids a lip-splitting incision but has thedisadvantage of anesthesia of chin/lower lip (due to the sacrifice of submental nerves).The surgical approach selected for excision of oral cavity tumors depends on the size of the tumor,location (anterior vs posterior), proximity to bone (mandible or maxilla), and the need to performneck dissection. The most commonly employed approaches are as follows:• Peroral accessible early-stage tumors-• Lower cheek flap - tumors requiring partialmandibulectomy or large posterolateral tumors that cannot be accessed via a peroral approach1053•• Upper cheek flap - tumors requiring partial maxillectomy or those involving the hard palate,upper gum, upper gingivobuccal sulcus and anterior soft palate• Mandibulotomy -larger tumors of the posterior oral cavity, tumors that involve the base of the tongueor pharyngeal wall.• Visor flap - larger lesions of the anterior oral cavity involving the anterior floor of the mouth andlower gum that are not amenable to a peroral approachCommando operation is the combined mandibular resection and neck node dissection. It is usedmainly for carcinoma of the tongue.Solution to Question 25:Abbé- Estlander flaps are used for the reconstruction of the lip.They are lip switch flaps based on the sublabial or superior labial artery. When the defect involvesthe commissure, the Estlander flap is used, and the Abbé flap is used for more midline defects.DSolution to Question 26:The given scenario and carotid angiogram showing splaying of the bifurcation of the carotids, alsoknown as lyre sign points to a diagnosis of chemodectoma. Fine-needle aspiration cytology(FNA",
        "C": "is contraindicated when a chemodectoma is suspected.Chemodectoma is also known as carotid body tumor (aka potato tumor). It is a benign tumor ofthe neuroendocrine tissue of the carotid body. It has a higher incidence at high altitudes becauseof chronic hypoxia, which leads to carotid body hyperplasia.The tumor presents as a slowly enlarging mass that is firm, rubbery, pulsatile, mobile from side toside but not up and down. A bruit may be heard. Family history can be present in 10% of the1054cases.Shamblin classification is used for staging carotid body tumors.Lyre signOMARROWSolution to Question 27:The most common site of a branchial cyst is at the junction of the upper and middle third of thesternomastoid muscle at its anterior border.The below image shows a large right-sided branchial cyst.Branchial cyst develops due to the persistence of the cervical sinus. The cervical sinus is formedwhen the 2nd arch mesoderm overgrows the succeeding arches and overhangs them as shown inthe image. The space between the overhanging 2nd pharyngeal arch and the 3rd, 4th, and 6tharches is called the cervical sinus. The cavity of the cervical sinus is lined by ectoderm and1055normally gets obliterated.Branchial cysts are usually lined by squamous epithelium and contain thick, turbid fluid full ofcholesterol crystals. It is fluctuant and may transilluminate when it contains clear fluid.A branchial fistula may be acquired or congenital. The congenital fistula is seen at the junction ofthe middle and lower third of the sternomastoid (option B). An acquired fistula is usually seen incases of incomplete surgery for the branchial cyst or spontaneous rupture, and it is seen at thesame site as the cyst.Pharyngeal clefts1st Pharyngealcleft-Ext. auditorymeatusIIOverhanging2nd arch-CervicalsinusIVCervicalsinusIVOMARROWSolution to Question 28:Tumors limited to the glottis usually do not spread to any lymph nodes, as there are nolymphatics in the vocal cords. However, if the tumor invades the supra- or the infra-glottic spaces,lymph node spread can occur.The most common malignant tumor of the larynx is squamous cell carcinoma. Glottis is the mostcommon site of laryngeal cancer.Solution to Question 29:Digastric muscle is spared in radical neck dissection (RN",
        "D": ". RND is used in the treatment ofmalignant lesions of the neck with local spread or metastasis.In 1905, Crile described RND where Level I-V LN, sternocleidomastoid (SCM), internal jugularvein (IJV), and XI cranial nerve (spinal accessory nerve) are removed.In 1962, Suarez described modified RND (MRND) where Level I-V LNs are removed and thefollowing are preserved:•• MRND I - XI cranial nerve1056• MRND II - XI cranial nerve and IJV• MRND III - XI cranial nerve, IJV, and SCMNote: RND with an additional LN/muscle/nerve is called extended RND.Solution to"
