      "explanation": "SMA-LRVLeftKidneyE1201Option B is the false statement. In superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome, theaortomesenteric angle is reduced to less than 25 degrees. The normal aortomesenteric angle isapproximately between 38-65 degrees.SMA syndrome, also called Wilkie's syndrome (option D), is characterized by an obstruction of thethird part of the duodenum by the SMA (option A) due to compression against fixedretroperitoneal structures.Symptoms include episodic epigastric pain associated with vomiting. Risk factors include rapidchildhood growth without compensatory weight gain, profound weight loss, abdominal surgery,inflammatory diseases of the abdomen, and immobilization in a cast that increases lordosis andaccentuates the angle of the SMA with the aorta.Abdominal CT angiography is the investigation of choice. The CT image below shows narrowedaortomesenteric angle in SMA syndrome:Lifestyle therapy includes frequent small feedings and patients may benefit from lying prone or ontheir left side postprandially.In some cases, weight gain or removal of a body cast improves symptoms. Laparoscopic lysis ofthe ligament of Treitz is beneficial in few cases. The preferred surgical treatment is Strong'sprocedure involving duodenojejunostomy (option C).1202AortaThird portionof duodenumSuperior mesentericarteryWilkie syndromeAortaAnterior viewMACompressedduodenum.Superiormesentericartery-Lateral viewOMARROW1203",
