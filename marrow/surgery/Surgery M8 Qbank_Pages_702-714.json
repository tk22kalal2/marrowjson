      "explanation": "Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is more common in females.Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is a rare vascular tumour. The infantile variety is benign,while the adult variety is malignant. It may undergo malignant degeneration into angiosarcoma.It is related to exposure to vinyl chloride and oral contraceptive pills (OCPs).It can affect the lungs, liver, and bones. In the liver, it manifests as multiple bilateral hepaticmasses. Extrahepatic metastases occur in approximately 25% of patients. Liver failure is a fatalcomplication.Hypervascular enhancement is observed on CECT. A percutaneous biopsy can help differentiatefrom other tumours. Factor VIII staining differentiates it from other nonvascular tumours.Treatment is total hepatectomy with liver transplantation.",

      "explanation": "The given CECT abdomen shows a well-defined hypodense lesion in the liver with asymmetricalnodular peripheral enhancement which is characteristic of hemangioma.Hemangioma is a benign tumor composed of increased proliferation of blood vessels. It is themost common benign tumour of the liver and is mainly seen in women at a mean age of 45 years.Small capillary hemangiomas are of no clinical significance. They are usually solitary, &lt;5 cm indiameter, with equal occurrence in the right and left halves of the liver. However, gianthemangiomas of diameter &gt;5 cm require attention.They are most commonly asymptomatic and incidentally found during imaging studies. Largecompressive masses may cause vague upper abdominal symptoms. The appearance of hepatichemangioma in a contrast-enhanced CT scan is as follows:•Non-contrast phase: Well-defined hypodense lesion•Arterial phase: Peripheral nodular enhancement• Washout phase: Homogenous enhancementThe image given below shows early phase with peripheral high attenuation (a) and late phase withhomogenous high attenuation (b).708abEarly phaseLate phase",

The nuclear imaging techniques for the diagnosis ofhemangiomas are used only when high-quality CT and MRI are unavailable.CECT is the investigation of choice wherein a typical peripheral nodular enhancement pattern isseen.On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), hemangiomas are hypointense on T1-weighted images andhyperintense on T2-weighted images.The below MRI image shows the light bulb sign seen in hemangioma of the liver.O709Percutaneous biopsy is potentially dangerous and inaccurate and, therefore, not recommended.Isotope scans used for the investigation of hepatobiliary disease are:• Technetium-99m colloid scan - parenchymal diseases of the liver, such as cirrhosis and alcoholichepatitis• Technetium-99m hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan - acute cholecystitis andcongenital biliary atresia.•Technetium-99m sulphur colloid scan - focal nodular hyperplasia",
