It usually signifies mild to moderate chronicvascular occlusive disease.Rest pain is when the disease progresses to a degree that perfusion is severely reduced andcramp-like pain in the calf is felt even at rest.A swollen and erythematous limb is seen in critical limb ischemia. When the limb is in thedependent position, there is pooling of blood which causes the limb to appear red andswollen(sunset foot sign).Buerger's test is done to assess the severity of peripheral vascular disease. In normal individuals,the elevation of the lower limb to a 90-degree angle does not produce any pallor but in affectedindividuals, even at an elevation of 20-degrees, pallor and venous guttering of the limb can beseen.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Chronic smoker presenting with bluish discoloration of the toe along with intermittentclaudication is suggestive of peripheral arterial disease and duplex scanning will be the nextappropriate investigation.Duplex Scanning is a major non-invasive technique that uses B-mode ultrasound to provide animage of the vessel. Most scanners now have color coding, which allows detailed visualization ofblood flow in a vessel. Different colors indicate changes in the direction and velocity of flow, withareas of high flow usually indicating stenotic lesions.Other options:Option A: CT Angiography (CTA) is more useful in the evaluation of visceral arterial disease (eg.mesenteric ischemia). It can be beneficial in peripheral artery diseases where a duplex scan showspoor images (aortoiliac segment involvement). CTA is not routinely recommended in peripheralartery disease because of concomitant renal dysfunction in these patients which can lead tocontrast-induced nephropathy.Option B: MR Angiography is time-consuming and expensive, hence not done as the nextinvestigation. It is contraindicated in patients with claustrophobia and metallic implants.1173Option C: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is an invasive and expensiveprocedure compared to other investigations. The benefits of DSA are that it provides dynamicarterial flow information and can be combined with a definitive endovascular intervention whenindicated. DSA is indicated only when there is a discrepancy in diagnosis or intervention isplanned. Complications associated with DSA include bleeding, hematoma, false aneurysmformation, thrombosis, arterial dissection, distal embolisation, renal dysfunction, and allergicreaction.MRADSACTA",

The waveform becomes biphasic in mild-moderate stenosisand monophasic in severe stenosis.Option A: Duplex scanning is a major non-invasive technique that uses B-modeultrasound to provide an image of the vessel.Option C: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is now the standard technique whereby theimages obtained are digitized by computer and the extraneous background (bone, soft tissues,etc.) is removed to provide clearer images.Option D: Computed tomographic angiography (CTA), and conventional catheter-basedangiography should not be used for routine diagnostic testing but are performed before potentialrevascularization.

      "explanation": "Angioplasty gives the best results for medium-sized vessels hence it is preferred for treating thevessels above the knee in peripheral arterial disease.Angioplasty is indicated in patients with rest pain or tissue necrosis.•Steps of angioplasty:Patients posted for angioplasty are given aspirin (325 mg) and clopidogrel (loading dose of300-600 mg).During the procedure, anticoagulation is achieved by administration of unfractionated heparin,enoxaparin, or bivalirudin (a direct thrombin inhibitor).• The femoral artery is punctured under local anesthetic, followed by insertion of a guidewire. Theguidewire is negotiated through the stenosis or occlusion under fluoroscopic control.• A balloon catheter is then inserted over the guidewire and positioned within the lesion. Theballoon is then inflated at high pressure for approximately 1 minute and deflated.• Once the angioplasty is done, dilatation is confirmed by performing angiogram.1175HeartCoronary arterylocated on thesurface of the heartNarrowedPlaquearteryCoronaryarteryPlaqueCathebersClosed stentExpanded stentBalloonClosed stent aroundballoon catheterArtery cross-sectionStent widened arteryCompressed plaqueIncreasedblood flowStentCompressedplaqueWidenedartery",

      "explanation": "The great saphenous vein (GSV) is the best as it lasts longer than polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE),dacron, and human umbilical vein as a graft in a femoropopliteal bypass.The GSV is the conduit of choice for arterial bypass grafts below the inguinal ligament.For bypass above the inguinal ligament, while both GSV and PTFE grafts have similar patencyrates in the first 2 years, the GSV is superior thereafter and hence preferred over PTFE or anyother grafts.The ipsilateral GSV is the conduit of choice for femoropopliteal bypass. When it is not available,contralateral GSV should be used. Other veins are preferred when both ipsilateral andcontralateral GSV is not available and they include a small saphenous vein, cephalic vein, andbasilic vein.Non-autogenous grafts are used for patients who lack a suitable venous conduit. The mostcommonly used prosthetic conduit is PTFE. Recent studies have shown that heparin-bondedPTFE is superior to compared to PTFE without heparin.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of atheroembolism. It is also called cholesterol embolismor blue toe syndrome.Atheroembolism is a condition in which multiple small deposits of fibrin, platelets, andcholesterol debris embolize from proximal atherosclerotic lesions or aneurysmal sites.1177The typical presentation is a patient with ST-elevation myocardial infarction presenting withfeatures of limb ischemia (cyanotic discoloration of the toes with pain and tenderness) followingan intraarterial procedure (angioplasty).Digital vascular occlusion may result in ischemia and the \"blue toe\" syndrome; digital necrosis andgangrene may develop. Localized areas of tenderness, pallor, and livedo reticularis occur at sitesof emboli. Since the atheroemboli tend to lodge in the small vessels of the limbs and may notocclude the large vessels, distal pulses are usually palpable.Large protruding aortic atheromas are a source of emboli that may lead to limb ischemia, as wellas stroke and renal insufficiency. Skin or muscle biopsy may demonstrate cholesterol crystals.Sharp syndrome, also known as mixed connective tissue disease, is an autoimmune condition withfeatures of SLE, systemic sclerosis, and polymyositis.

If there is severe sepsis and if re-establishingblood supply is difficult(revascularization) then amputation is the preferred choice of treatment.Gangrene refers to death of macroscopic portions of tissue which turn black because of thebreakdown of haemoglobin and the formation of iron sulphide.It usually affects the most distal part of a limb because of arterial obstruction (from thrombosis,embolus or arteritis).Dry gangrene occurs when the tissues are desiccated by gradual slowing of the bloodstream.

      "explanation": "In acrocyanosis, there is no pain or numbness. In Raynaud's phenomenon, there is pain andtingling sensation.Acrocyanosis is a chronic, benign vasoconstrictive disorder. It is due to arterial vasoconstrictionand secondary dilation of the capillaries and venules that results in persistent cyanosis of thehands and feet. It can be primary or secondary.Primary acrocyanosis is more common in females with an onset &lt;30 years. Trophic skinchanges and ulcerations do not occur and examination reveals normal pulses.The disorder can be distinguished from Raynaud's phenomenon:• Because it is persistent and not episodic• There is no pain in acrocyanosis whereas in Raynaud's phenomenon there is pain and numbness• The discoloration extends proximally from the digits•Blanching does not occur",
