This includes blood loss of &gt;600mL/24h or &gt;150ml/h which can floodthe anatomical dead space of the lung.Bleeding can either be from the bronchial artery circulation (most common) or from thepulmonary artery circulation. Bleeding from cavitary lesions is due to pulmonary artery erosion.The chest X-ray is the first investigation followed by rigid or flexible bronchoscopy.The cause of death in massive hemoptysis is usually due to asphyxiation (rather than blood lossitself). This is why airway stabilization by intubating into the non-bleeding lung is the priority.After ventilation is achieved, the bleeding site should be identified using bronchoscopy. Bleedingis controlled by laser, bronchial occlusion, or arterial embolization.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The ultrasound diagnosis of pneumothorax depends on the presence of barcode sign, absence ofthe sliding lung and absence of comet-tail artifacts that are seen in relation to a normallung-pleural interface.Normally, lung sliding corresponds to the to-and-fro movement of the visceral pleura on theparietal pleura that occurs with respiration. It is a dynamic sign and can be identified onultrasound as horizontal movement along the pleural line.In pneumothorax, the air separates visceral and parietal pleura and prevents visualization ofvisceral pleura. Hence lung sliding is absent and typical to and fro movement and shimmering ofthe pleural lines will not be present.Comet tail artifacts are seen in the normal lungs due to the acoustic impedance differencesbetween water and air, whereas it is absent in pneumothorax.The image given below shows a sliding sign seen in a normal lung.1144REFT LUNGSlide signB-ModeAPleurallineM-ModeOption A: The quad sign is seen in pleural effusion. It consists of four lines representing thepleura, rib, fluid, and lung.Option C: The motionless portion of the chest above the pleural line creates horizontal 'waves,'and the sliding below the pleural line creates a granular pattern, the ‘sand'. The resultant pictureis one that resembles waves crashing onto the sand and is therefore called the 'seashore sign' andis present in normal lungs.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of tension pneumothorax. The first line of management intension pneumothorax is to insert a wide-bore needle in the 5th intercostal space just anterior tothe midaxillary line.Pneumothorax is the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space. Tension pneumothoraxdevelops when air enters the pleural space through a point that acts as a one-way valve. More andmore air enters with every breath without any way for the air to escape. This is a medicalemergency where the patient can quickly deteriorate.A patient with pneumothorax presents with acute dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain. A physicalexamination will reveal:• An enlarged hemithorax• Decreased chest movements• Hyper-resonance on percussion• Absent vocal fremitus• Diminished breath soundsIn addition to the above findings, a tension pneumothorax would also have the following:• Deviation of trachea to the opposite side1145• Distended neck vein•Cyanosis•Sudden onset hemodynamic compromise:• Hypotension• Tachycardia• Low O2 saturation• Loss of consciousnessA diagnosis of tension pneumothorax is usually made based on the clinical findings. If the tensionin the pleural cavity is not relieved, the patient can die due to hemodynamic collapse. Hence,treatment should never be delayed waiting for radiological confirmation.The management of tension pneumothorax is to convert a tension pneumothorax into a simplepneumothorax. This can be done by rapid decompression using a wide-bore cannula on theaffected side, followed by the insertion of a chest tube for definitive management.The safest site for insertion of a drain is in the triangle (Triangle of safety) that lies:• Anterior to the mid-axillary line• Above the level of the nipple•⚫ Below and lateral to the pectoralis major muscleTriangle of safetyOMARROWNote:If immediate management is asked, the answer will be to insert a wide-bore needle in the 5thintercostal space in the midaxillary line.If definitive management is asked, the answer will be to insert an intercostal tube in the triangleof safety.1146Suture placementdrainTriangleQaudingdistinsertionOMARROW",

Initial management, in this case,is to apply occlusive dressing taped on the 3 sides.Open pneumothorax is due to a large open defect in the chest, making intrathoracic pressureequal to atmospheric pressure. In this defect, the air is preferentially drawn through the defect,rather than through the trachea. Air gets accumulated causing pneumothorax leading tohypoventilation and hypoxia.

      "explanation": "Bronchial carcinoid is usually asymptomatic.Bronchial carcinoids are the most indolent of the spectrum of pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors.They arise from the Kulchitsky cells in the bronchial epithelium. Most tumors are confined to themain stem bronchus and commonly project into the lumen. It is associated with MEN 1.Most patients affected are &lt;40 years and it is not related to smoking. It is usually asymptomaticand only 10% of bronchial carcinoids give rise to carcinoid syndrome which is characterized byintermittent attacks of:• Diarrhea• Flushing.• Bronchospasm• CyanosisBronchial carcinoids follow a relatively benign course and do not metastasize to distant sites. Theyhave a good prognosis and can be easily resected.",

At the end of the procedure, chest drains are placed to allow dependent drainage.The following precautions must be noted before placing the drains:• The drain should exit the skin anterior to the midaxillary line. If this is not done then the patientwill have to lie on the tube which will cause pain and obstruction of the tube.•The course of the drain should be oblique to the skin, chest wall, and pleura, or else it will leadto kinking of the tube.1159The main advantage of VATS is that a large incision is avoided.
