      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The phrenocolic ligament prevents the downward displacement of the spleen.The phrenicocolic ligament is not attached to the spleen. It attaches the splenic flexure of thecolon to the diaphragm. When the spleen gets enlarged, the phrenicocolic ligament along with thesplenic flexure of the colon restricts its downward displacement. The enlargement of the spleenoccurs towards the right iliac fossa and is directed obliquely.Splenic ligaments and their attachments:Splenic ligamentAttachmentsPhrenicocolic ligamentPhrenicosplenic ligamentSplenorenal (lienorenal) ligamentGastrosplenicligamentDiaphragmto the splenic flexure of thecolonPosterior abdominal wall to theupper pole of the spleenHilum of the spleen to the anterior surface of the left kidneyGreater curvature of the stomach to the upper pole of the spleenContentsTail of pancreasSplenic artery and veinShort gastric vessels Left gastroepiploic artery789Spleen and it's ligamentsMARROWPhrenosplenicligamentGastrosplenicligamentSpleenSplenocolicligamentPhrenicocolicligamentThe below image shows the cross-sectional view of the spleen and its ligaments:OMARROWLesser omentumStomachGastrosplenicligamentSpleenVSplenorenal/lienorenalligamentVisceralperitoneumLeft kidney",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The image showing petechiae and the given history of a child presenting with mucocutaneousbleed following an upper respiratory tract infection are highly suggestive of immunethrombocytopenic purpura.In idiopathic/immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), the spleen is palpable in fewer than 10%of the patients, and the presence of gross splenic enlargement should raise the suspicion of analternative diagnosis.Management of ITP:•In patients with platelet counts &lt;30,000/µL, treatment may be instituted if there aresymptoms of life-threatening bleeding.••• Prednisone at 1 mg/kg is the initial treatment of choice.• Rh(D) immune globulin is used only in Rh-positive patients.• Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).•Splenectomy is indicated in patients who have relapsed on glucocorticoid therapy. Relapsepatients with intermittent or high platelet count can be managed with anti-Rho(D)immunoglobulin, IVIG, or with a thrombopoietin receptor agonist.•Subcutaneous romiplostim and oral eltrombopag are thrombopoietin receptor agonists used inadults who are at risk of bleeding even after splenectomy.Option A: The acute form is more commonly seen in children following a viral infection, while thechronic form is more often seen in adult women of childbearing years.Option C: The bone marrow examination can be normal or show an increased number ofmegathrombocytes.Option D: 80% of cases undergo spontaneous remission in children. Patients who do not respondto first-line therapy like steroids and IVIG are best treated by splenectomy.791",
