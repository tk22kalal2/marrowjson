      "explanation": "Dissection medial (not lateral) to the endopelvic fascia investing the mesorectum causes localrecurrence.Dissection lateral to the avascular anatomic space, risks injury to the mixed autonomic nerves,causing impotence in men and bladder dysfunction in men and women.Transmesorectal resection involves complete removal of the lymph node bearing mesorectumalong with its intact enveloping fascia. It is a curative resection of rectal tumours of the middleand lower thirds of the rectum, either as part of Low Anterior Resection (LAR) orAbdominoperineal Resection (APR).606Option A: The majority of colorectal cancers are sporadic. Approximately 5% of all colorectalcancers are attributed to familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Lynch syndrome (hereditarynon-polyposis colorectal cancer).Option B: The large bowel can tolerate delivered radiation doses of up to 6000 cGy. However,a lower dose of 45 Gy is recommended for colorectal tumours. High levels of radiation targeted atcolon tumours would include the small bowel in the treatment field.

      "explanation": "Hartmann's operation is an excellent procedure in an elderly, frail patient in whom there isconcern about anal sphincter function or the viability of an anastomosis.Through an abdominal incision, the rectum is excised, the rectal stump is stapled closed and theproximal colon exteriorized as a permanent end colostomy.Note: Endoluminal stenting is being increasingly used in patients with obstructing carcinomas. Itcan be either used as a palliative procedure or to relieve the obstruction. Only rectosigmoid andupper rectal tumours are suitable for stenting because stent impingement on the anorectum inlow cancers can result in tenesmus.613",
