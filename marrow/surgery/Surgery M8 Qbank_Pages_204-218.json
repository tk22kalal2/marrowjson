Paget disease of the breast is often mistaken foreczema.A nipple biopsy specimen of Paget's disease will show a population of cells that are identical to theunderlying malignant cells. The presence of large, pale, vacuolated cells (Paget cells) with roundor oval nuclei are pathognomonic for this condition.210Depending on the type and extent of underlying malignancy, it can be treated with lumpectomy ormastectomy.Paget's diseaseEczemaLateralitUnilateralBilateralyAge groMenopausal woLactating womenupmenEdgesDistinctIndistinctVesiclesAbsentPresentNippleUsually destroyUsually intactedLumpUsually presentNo underlying lumpPaget's CellsNote: Histologically, Paget's disease can be confused with superficial spreading melanoma,particularly if they have incorporated melanin from adjacent epidermis.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "In the given scenario, the rapid onset of the disease and the examination findings are suggestiveof inflammatory carcinoma of the breast.Inflammatory breast cancer is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. It mimics acutemastitis. The hallmark of inflammatory breast carcinoma is the diffuse tumor involvement of thedermal lymphatics within the breast and the overlying skin, often without a discrete underlyingtumor mass (peau d' orange appearance). The patient presents with rapidly progressive swelling ofthe breast, warmth, erythema and edema. A breast lump may or may not be present.A diagnosis of inflammatory breast carcinoma should be suspected when a patient with rapidlyprogressive swelling with inflammatory skin changes does not respond to antibiotics. The imagingfeatures with ultrasound and a mammograph is non-specific due to the underlying erythema andedema. A biopsy should be done to confirm the diagnosis.Treatment includes combined-modality treatment:212• Neoadjuvant chemotherapy•Mastectomy•••• Radiation therapyHormonal therapy- for ER-positive tumorsTrastuzumab for HER-2-positive tumorsOption B: Giant fibroadenomas occasionally occur during puberty. These are benign solidencapsulated slow-growing tumors over 5 cm in diameter. It presents as a painless lump in thebreast. They are managed by excision via a submammary incision.Option C: Phyllodes tumors usually occur in women over the age of 40 years but can appear inyounger women. Phyllodes tumor is mostly benign even though it is also called cystosarcomaphyllodes. It presents as a large tumor with an unevenly bosselated surface. They are usuallymobile over the chest wall despite their large size. This tumor does not infiltrate the skin. Nippleretraction is not seen in this condition. Benign lesions can be treated with enucleation or widelocal excision. Massive tumours, recurrent tumours and malignant lesions are treated with amastectomy.Option D: Galactocele are the most common benign breast lesions in lactating women. It is acystic enlargement of the mammary gland containing milk. They are mostly detected duringlactation or in the third trimester of pregnancy but rarely, may also present after stoppingbreastfeeding. Clinically, the mass is usually firm and non-tender and presents as a solidtumour-like lesion on physical examination. The patient usually notes thelesion during lactation or some period after lactation. Needle aspiration, followedby excision should it recur, is the standard method of treating galactocele.",

It is the hallmarkof inflammatory carcinoma.Option A: Infiltration of Cooper's ligaments leads to dimpling of the skin.Option C: Infiltration of the lactiferous ducts leads to nipple retraction.Cancer-en-cuirasse is an aggressive form of cancer, where there is cutaneous and subcutaneousinfiltration of the cancer cells.Note: While Peau d'orange indicates skin involvement, dimpling of the skin and nipple retractiondo not indicate skin involvement.",
