      "explanation": "The above clinical scenario points to a case of splenic vein thrombosis which can cause left-sidedportal hypertension. It is a pre-hepatic cause of portal hypertension. It is managedby splenectomy.Splenic vein thrombosis can be due to pancreatic inflammation or neoplasms (acute or chronicpancreatitis, pseudocysts, and carcinomas) that extend outside the pancreas and invades thesplenic vein. This causes increased pressure in the splenic vein leading to the formation ofcollaterals and ultimately gastric variceal hemorrhage (not esophageal varices).Normal liver function tests, normal portal venous pressures, and splenomegaly are thedistinguishing features from other forms of portal hypertension. The portal vein pressures remainnormal as there is no obstruction of the hepatic venous vasculature.Diagnosis is done by gastroscopy, liver function tests, ultrasound examination (with doppler), andcontrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen.

The antibody can be present because of prior infection, and hence,detection of Entamoeba histolytica lectin antigen in the serum and liver abscess pus is more usefulfor acute infections than chronic infection.Nuclear medicine studies, such as gallium scanning or technetium (99mTc) liver scans, can behelpful in differentiating pyogenic from amebic abscesses because amebic abscesses typically donot contain leukocytes and therefore do not light up on these scans.The mainstay of treatment for amebic abscesses is metronidazole (750 mg orally, three times dailyfor 10 days), which is curative. Luminal agents such as iodoquinol, paromomycin, and diloxanidefuroate can be administered into the cysts.",

Its life cycle consists of sheep and dogs as hosts. Humans are accidental hosts.A hydatid cyst usually develops three weeks after the infection. The cyst is surrounded by a fibrouscapsule called pericyst that is derived from the host tissue.The cyst wall is composed of two layers, ectocyst (outer gelatinous membrane), and endocyst(inner germinal membrane). Ectocyst is a laminated membrane, which is acellular. It helps in thepassage of nutrients. The endocyst helps in producing the laminated membrane and scoleces.The brood capsules are cellular masses in the hydatid fluid which consists of scoleces.

It divides the liver isdivided into eight segments. Each segment has its own vascular supply, biliary drainage, andlymphatic drainage. Segment I corresponds to the caudate lobe of the liver and segment IVcorresponds to the quadrate lobe of the liver.The Couinaud's Liver Segments are as follows:679Term for surgicalresectionCouinaudsegmentsRight hepatectomyRight hemihepatectomy5. 6. 7, BDiagram(pertinent areais shaded)Left hepatectomyLeft hemihepatectomy2. 3. 44Right anteriorsectionectomyRight posteriorsectionectomyLeft medialsectionectomyLeft lateralsectionectomyR5.

A middle hepaticartery branches off from the proximal left hepatic artery.The replaced right hepatic artery directly supplies the right lobe of the liver.Surgical significance:In individuals with replaced right hepatic artery, the diameter of the common hepatic artery issmaller. In liver transplant recipients, this can be a cause for the increased incidence ofcomplications such as thrombosis.Whereas, replaced right hepatic artery is a beneficial variant for donors undergoing donation ofthe right lobe of the liver. The replaced right hepatic artery provides a longer and larger graft thusreducing chances of thrombosis.680Normal hepatic artery vasculatureRight hepatic arteryCystic arteryGastro-duodenal arteryLeft hepatic arteryROMARROWSplenic arteryCeliac trunkSuperior mesenteric arteryReplaced right hepatic arteryWReplaced right hepatic artery-Superior mesenteric arteryOMARROWSolution to Question 4:Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient is measured by subtracting Free Hepatic Venous Pressure fromWedged Hepatic Venous Pressure.HVPG = WHVP - FHVP==Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) is the pressure gradient between the portal vein and theinferior vena cava (IVC). It is a measure of portal venous pressure. It can quantify the degree ofportal hypertension due to sinusoidal resistance to blood flow.The most accurate method of determining portal hypertension is by measuring HVPG. The mostcommonly used procedure involves placing a balloon catheter in the hepatic vein after a jugularvein puncture. The free hepatic venous pressure (FHVP) is measured with the balloon deflated,and the wedged hepatic venous pressure (WHVP) with the balloon inflated to occlude the hepatic681vein.Solution to Question 5:The normal portal venous pressure is 5 to 10 mmHg.Normal portal blood flow is 1 to 1.5 L/minute.Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) is the difference between the wedge and free hepaticvenous pressure, which is 1 to 5 mmHg.HVPG interpretation:• Normal HVPG is between 1 and 5 mmHg.• Portal hypertension is present if the HVPG is °6 mmHg.• Portal hypertension typically becomes clinically significant when the HVPG is °10 mmHg, atwhich point varices may develop.• HVPG 12 mmHg, patients are at risk for variceal bleeding and the development of ascites.Solution to Question 6:Splenomegaly is a pre-hepatic cause of portal hypertension. Sarcoidosis and primary biliarycholangitis are presinusoidal intrahepatic causes of portal hypertension.Portal hypertension occurs when the pressure in the portal vein increases due to either increasedresistance to blood flow secondary to fibrosis, active vasoconstriction, or hyperdynamic systemiccirculation.Solution to Question 7:The above clinical scenario points to a case of splenic vein thrombosis which can cause left-sidedportal hypertension. It is a pre-hepatic cause of portal hypertension. It is managedby splenectomy.Splenic vein thrombosis can be due to pancreatic inflammation or neoplasms (acute or chronicpancreatitis, pseudocysts, and carcinomas) that extend outside the pancreas and invades thesplenic vein. This causes increased pressure in the splenic vein leading to the formation ofcollaterals and ultimately gastric variceal hemorrhage (not esophageal varices).Normal liver function tests, normal portal venous pressures, and splenomegaly are thedistinguishing features from other forms of portal hypertension. The portal vein pressures remainnormal as there is no obstruction of the hepatic venous vasculature.Diagnosis is done by gastroscopy, liver function tests, ultrasound examination (with doppler), andcontrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen. Treatment includes splenectomy and management ofthe primary pancreatic pathology.682Portal veinRightgastric veinSuperiormesentericveinLeft-sided portal hypertensionSplenic veinOMARROWGastric varicesEnlarged spleen-ThrombusGastro-epiploic veinSolution to Question 8:The image shows the snake-skin appearance of the gastric mucosa, which is seen in cases of portalhypertensive gastropathy.Portal hypertensive gastropathy is characterized by the diffuse dilation of the mucosal andsubmucosal venous plexus of the stomach associated with overlying gastritis.Option A: Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) also known as watermelon stomach is asignificant cause of acute or chronic gastrointestinal blood loss in the elderly, characterizedendoscopically by watermelon stripes.

The disorder isassociated with excessive secretion of transforming growth factor-alpha.Option D: Dieulafoy's lesion is a medical condition characterized by a large tortuous arteriole thaterodes and bleeds and occurs most commonly in the stomach wall.Solution to Question 9:Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is an uncommon congestive hepatopathy characterized by theobstruction of hepatic venous outflow and it becomes clinically significant when two or moremajor hepatic veins are obstructed.684Types:• Primary Budd-Chiari syndrome: when the obstructive process involves an endoluminal venousthrombosis.• Secondary Budd-Chiari syndrome: when the veins are compressed or invaded by a neighboringlesion originating outside the vein.Most common presentation: ascites and abdominal discomfort.Risk factors include-Primary myeloproliferative disorders, anticardiolipin antibodies,hyperhomocysteinemia, and oral contraceptive use.Caudate lobe hypertrophy is seen in approximately 50% of the cases and it is because the caudatelobe drains directly into the IVC.Abdominal ultrasonography with color Doppler is the initial investigation of choice and candemonstrate the absence of hepatic vein flow, spider web hepatic veins, and collateral hepaticveins.The definitive radiographic study is hepatic venography to determine the presence and extent ofhepatic vein thrombus as well as measure inferior vena cava (IVC) pressures.Solution to Question 10:The above clinical scenario describes a case of late budd-chiari syndrome and surgicalinterventions are not done in all cases of budd chiari syndrome.SAAG = (serum albumin) – (ascitic fluid albumin)=(3) - (1.5) = 1.5g/dLAs SAAG is &gt;1.1g/dL( 1.5g/dL) and ascitic fluid protein is &lt; 2.5 g/dL, the most likely cause islate Budd-Chiari syndrome.Surgical interventions are done in those patients of Budd Chiarisyndrome who are not responding to medical therapy.Colour flow doppler is the initial investigation of choice.Treatment:• Initial treatment consists of medically managing the underlying disease process and preventingthe extension of the hepatic vein thrombosis through systemic anticoagulation.• The associated portal hypertension and ascites are managed in a manner similar to that in mostcirrhotic patients.• Radiologic and surgical intervention should be reserved for patients whose condition isnonresponsive to medical therapy. Percutaneous angioplasty and transjugular intrahepaticportosystemic shunt (TIPS), in combination with thrombolytic therapy, are the preferredstrategies to restore the outflow of blood from the liver.• Surgical shunting, particularly with the side-to-side portacaval shunt, turns the portal vein intoa hepatic outflow tract.Factors contributing to a bad prognosis in Budd-Chiari syndrome:685Involvement of all three hepatic veins and/or portal veinPresence of ascitesOlder age at the time of presentationHigh Child-Pugh scoreChronic disease at presentationNote: JAK2 mutation points to a possibility of polycythemia vera predisposing the patient tohypercoagulable states and the formation of thrombus anywhere in the body. From the serum andascitic protein values, we can calculate the SAAG (serum protein-ascitic protein).Solution to Question 11:Platelet transfusion is not done in the case of active variceal bleeding unless coagulopathy isconfirmed as the cause. Platelet transfusions are indicated only in patients with a platelet count of&lt;50,000/microL or in patients with evidence of microvascular bleeding.Variceal hemorrhage is a medical emergency. Varices usually present with the acuteonset large-volume haematemesis, the lower esophagus being the most common site for varicealbleeding.The sites for portosystemic anastomosis are:••• Left gastric vein to distal oesophageal veins: oesophageal and gastric variceal bleedingSuperior rectal veins to Middle and inferior rectal veins: hemorrhoids and rectal bleeding• Left branch of the portal vein to Periumbilical veins: caput-medusae• The right branch of the portal vein to retroperitoneal veins draining into azygos, hemiazygos,lumbar, intercostal, and phrenic veins•⚫ Omental and colonic veins near hepatic and splenic ■exures to Retroperitoneal veins nearhepatic and splenic exuresMedical management of variceal bleeding includes blood transfusion (option",
