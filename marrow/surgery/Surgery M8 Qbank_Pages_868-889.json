      "explanation": "The given scenario with CT showing multiple cysts in the kidneys and liver points to a diagnosis ofadult polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). In such patients, decompression or deroofing of thecysts (Rovsing's procedure) cannot restore normal renal function.ADPKD is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with mutations in the PKD1(chromosome 16)and PKD2 genes (chromosome 4).The disease does not usually manifest before 30 years of age, and in some patients, it is neverdiagnosed. The progression of the disease is faster in males.Hypertension is the most common presentation. Renal manifestations of ADPKD include:• Flank/loin pain - either due to hemorrhage inside cysts or due to renal stones (most commonlyuric acid stones)• Irregular upper quadrant renal mass•• Hematuria• Uremia• Renal failure (seen in 10-15% of the patients who receive hemodialysis)Intravenous pyelography shows characteristic spider leg sign, as a result of stretched calyces dueto multiple cysts. Nephrogram shows a swiss cheese appearance. On prenatal USG, the presenceof either &gt; 3 cysts in unilateral kidneys or &gt; 2 cysts in each kidney is suggestive of PKD.881Treatment includes:• Long-term dialysis• Renal transplantation•• Vasopressin V2 receptor antagonistsAutosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) occurs secondary to a mutation of thePKHD1 gene.

In IVU, theextrarenal pelvis is dilated and the minor calyces lose their normal cupping.

Delayed clearanceof contrast or the radiotracer implies obstruction.Renal isotope scans have replaced intravenous pyelogram as the diagnostic modality of choice inUPJ obstruction.• 99mTc-MAG3 is the most commonly used isotope in dynamic renography. Its uptake reflects thetubular function.• 99mTc-DTPA may also be used. Its uptake reflects the glomerular function. Hence, it iscommonly used to assess GFR.In obstructive uropathy, 99mTc-DTPA is the preferred isotope as glomerular function declinesearlier and more rapidly than tubular function.Micturating cystourethrogram is the investigation of choice in vesicoureteric reflux.Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan is used for assessing renal scarring.Note: In children, crying before and after micturition is usually considered normal.

      "explanation": "A low calcium diet has not shown any significant benefit in the prevention of calcium stoneformation, compared to a normocalcemic diet.However, a diet rich in calcium rather binds with dietary oxalate and reduces dietary absorptionof oxalate. This effect leads to a lower risk of calcium oxalate stone formation in the kidneys.Option B: Uric acid crystallization and stone formation take place in acidic pH. Therefore, urinaryalkalinization by potassium citrate reduces the risk of urate stone formation.Option C: Cystine stones are usually formed in presence of cystinuria. Initial treatment options toprevent recurrent cystine stone formation includes increased fluid intake and urinaryalkalinization (e.g citrate). If this therapy fails, d-penicillamine can be used.Option D: Pyridoxine acts as a cofactor in the oxalic acid metabolism process and helps in thereduction of endogenous oxalate levels.

      "explanation": "Cystine stones are very hard stones, hence it is difficult to disintegrate it with extracorporealshockwave lithotripsy (ESWL).ESWL is a non-invasive method that generates shockwaves outside the body, which are focusedon the stones. Stones up to approximately 1.5 cm in size are suitable for this form of treatment.Stones that are difficult to disintegrate by ESWL:• Cystine• Brushite• Calcium oxalate monohydrateStones that are relatively easy to disintegrate by ESWL:•Calcium oxalate dihydrate•Phosphate",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The treatment of choice for renal calculi of size &gt;2cm is percutaneous nephrolithotomy(PCNL).In PCNL, endoscopic instruments are passed into the kidney using a percutaneous technique, andstones are removed. PCNL is also indicated in:•Staghorn calculi•Multiple stones• Proximal ureteral stones &gt;1 cmComplications of percutaneous nephrolithotomy include hemorrhage, perforation of the collectingsystem, and of the colon or pleural cavity.Another approach for the management of renal stones is ureteroscopic removal (URS)or retrograde intra-renal surgery (RIRS). In URS, stones are removed via a retrograde approachusing a dormia basket, or a Holmium YAG laser is used to break the stones.If PCNL or URS fails, open or laparoscopic pyelolithotomy or nephrolithotomy is done.The image below summarizes how the Dormia basket works with ureteroscopy.Dormia basket and ureteroscopicrenal stone removal.BasketintroducedOpenedEnclosing stone,past stoneready forwithdrawalMARROW888",
