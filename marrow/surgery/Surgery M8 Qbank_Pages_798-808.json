      "explanation": "Insulinomas are distributed equally throughout the pancreas, despite the predominance ofbeta-cells in the body and tail.803The majority (90%) of insulinomas are benign and solitary, and only 10% are malignant andmultifocal. Malignant insulinomas are usually found in association with multiple endocrineneoplasia (MEN) syndrome. Insulinomas are typically small, with an average size of 1.0 to 1.5 cm.Insulinomas occur more commonly in females, between 40-60 years of age with the mean age ofdiagnosis at 45 years.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome/gastrinoma. Here, the basalacid output (BAO) is increased. Hence, the BAO:MAO ratio is increased.In these patients, there is gastrin hypersecretion that stimulates gastric acid secretion. Thisleads to peptic ulcers that occur at atypical sites like the duodenum and jejunum andare refractory and multiple.Abdominal pain is the most common complaint in these patients. However, diarrhea can occurdue to:• Acid-induced injury to the small intestine mucosa•Inability of the intestinal tract to absorb large volumes of fluids secreted by the stomach•Inactivation of pancreatic lipase by low pH•Precipitation of bile salts.The unique characteristic of acid-induced diarrhea is that it is controlled by nasogastric aspirationof gastric secretions.806Gastric pH &lt;2.5 and a serum gastrin concentration &gt;1000 pg/mL confirm the diagnosis ofZollinger Ellison syndrome.If the diagnosis remains in doubt, a secretin stimulation test is done. In this test, the fastinggastrin level is measured before secretin (2 IU/kg) is administered intravenously, and subsequentsamples are obtained 2, 5, 10, and 20 minutes. Gastrin levels &gt;200 pg/mL after administrationof secretin are suggestive of gastrinoma.",

However, it still misses many of the smaller lesions, and mayconfuse normal lymph nodes for gastrinomas.If there is no tumor visible on EUS, a somatostatin receptor study is useful in identifying thelocation. When the pretest probability of gastrinoma is high, the sensitivity and specificity of thismodality are almost 100%.",
