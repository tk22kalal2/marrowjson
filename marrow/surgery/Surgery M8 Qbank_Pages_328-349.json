      "explanation": "A thyroid-specific tracer like 99Tc-Pertechnetate and subsequent subtraction images could beused to rule out the false positives caused by the solid thyroid nodules such as Hurthle cell nodule.The Sestamibi scanning is a nuclear-based imaging test used to localize the parathyroid glands.Sestamibi is a monovalent lipophilic cation that accumulates in mitochondria. Due to this, there isa difference in the rate at which it gets washed out depending upon the number of mitochondriain each tissue. Parathyroid adenomas often have a high concentration of oxyphilic cells with highmitochondrial content and they retain tracers and have a slower washout compared to the normalglands.In patients with nodular goiter or functional tumors of the thyroid gland, increased uptake ofsestamibi by the thyroid gland makes parathyroid visualization difficult. There are two primarytechniques to differentiate sestamibi uptake by abnormal parathyroid and thyroid tissue:• Dual-isotope subtraction imaging (with sestamibi and either iodine-123 or 99mTcpertechnetate) - 99mTc pertechnetate is taken up only by the thyroid. The 99mTc pertechnetatescintigram is then digitally subtracted from the sestamibi scan to allow parathyroid localization.Single-isotope dual-phase imaging (with sestamibi alone with early and delayed imaging) - sincethe rate of washout from the hyperfunctioning parathyroid gland is slower when compared to thethyroid gland.•The image given below shows the dual-isotope subtraction imaging.339",

        "D": "Medical management with cinacalcet"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The patient's long-standing renal failure and elevated calcium, phosphate, and PTH are suggestiveof tertiary hyperparathyroidism. This form of hyperparathyroidism can be life-threatening, and allpatients with it should be referred for surgical intervention.The surgical procedure of choice for tertiary hyperparathyroidism is subtotal parathyroidectomy.In subtotal parathyroidectomy, the affected glands are completely removed and the least affected347gland is partially resected.Option A: Total parathyroidectomy without an autograft is not a treatment option due to thepostoperative and persistent difficulties in managing the associated hypocalcemia.Option C: Minimally invasive approaches commonly refer to the removal of a localized abnormalparathyroid gland through an incision less than 3cm in length. It is based on the principle thatover 80% of individuals with primary hyperparathyroidism have a single adenoma. It iscontraindicated in multi-glandular disease, lithium-induced hyperparathyroidism, andhyperparathyroidism associated with familial syndromes.Option D: Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic used in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism.The use of calcimimetics in tertiary hyperparathyroidism remains controversial and has not beenapproved for this indication.",

Withearly-onset, neck mass, and positive IHC for PGP9.5+, it is concerning for parathyroid cancer.Hypercalcemia is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with parathyroidcancer.Parathyroid cancer is a rare malignancy and makes up 1% of cases of primaryhyperparathyroidism. History of prior neck radiation is considered to be a risk factor. Patientsusually present a decade earlier than primary hyperparathyroidism (5th - 6th decade), with anequal preponderance in males and females. Patients may present with a neck mass and severelyelevated calcium and PTH levels.Treatment is focused on controlling hypercalcemia and surgery is the mainstay.Option B: Cardiovascular disease is a major contributing cause of mortality in patients withhyperthyroidism and chronic kidney disease.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Ossifying jaw fibromas are a pathognomonic feature of hyperparathyroid-jaw tumoursyndrome. It arises due to inactivating mutations in the HRPT2 gene on chromosome 1 q21-32,encoding parafibromin.It is a rare cause of primary hyperparathyroidism with an early onset (32 years) which presentswith severe hypercalcemia. It is associated with an increased risk of parathyroid carcinoma andother conditions like polycystic kidney disease. Surgical intervention may be considered to removeall enlarged glands.Osteitis fibrosa cystica is a feature of hyperparathyroidism but is not considered pathognomonicof any condition.349",
