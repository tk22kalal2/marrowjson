      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given clinical situation suggests a cervical spine injury due to trauma. The patient should not be shifted and a portable X-ray machine should be used for radiography after neck stabilization. Management in a trauma patient with a suspected cervical fracture involves the following steps: \n   1. Spinal immobilization with a rigid cervical collar and a long spine board is the immediate step in the management of blunt/penetrating cervical trauma cases.\n   2. It is followed by a gross assessment of spinal cord function by eliciting extremity movement. Tenderness over the injured vertebrae or the presence of a deformity is indicative of an associated fracture.\n   3. Imaging is done by X-ray or CT. Portable X-ray machines are preferred to avoid further injury while mobilizing the patient. They are useful in visualizing thoracic and lumbar vertebrae but not the cervicothoracic junction. Cervical CT has been made the modality of choice in most emergency departments owing to the high quality of images that can be obtained.",

        "D": "Patients with neurological deficits should be removed from the backboard as soon as possible"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Hypotension in acute spinal injury is due to the loss of sympathetic tone. The classic presentation of neurogenic shock is hypotension in the setting of warm, well-perfused extremities in a paralyzed patient. This condition requires intravascular volume expansion and vasopressor support. Option B: High cervical spinal cord injury (SCIs) may have immediate respiratory suppression. This requires airway management and ventilatory support because of paresis of the phrenic nerves. Hypoventilation can occur from paralysis of the intercostal muscles (injury to the lower cervical or upper thoracic spinal cord) or the diaphragm (injury to C3 to C5). Option C: Canadian C-Spine rule and NEXUS are validated clinical decision tools to help determine the need for radiographic evaluation and to clinically clear the cervical spine. NEXUS criteria: There are five criteria included under NEXUS. If a trauma patient meets all five criteria, then no radiography is required and the cervical c-spine collar may be removed. However, if any one of the criteria is met, then radiography is done to evaluate further. The NEXUS criteria include: No posterior midline cervical spinal tenderness, No evidence of intoxication, A normal level of alertness, No focal neurologic deficit, and No painful distracting injuries. Option D: Patients with or without neurological deficits should be removed from the backboard as soon as possible. A patient who is allowed to lie on the hardboard for more than 2 hours is at high risk for pressure ulcers.",

      "explanation": "Fluid responsive hemorrhagic shock is not an indication for immediate surgical intervention. The following are the indications for immediate surgical exploration of neck trauma. They are also known as the hard signs of neck trauma: Pulsatile bleeding, Expanding hematoma, Air bubbling from penetrating injury, Absent radial pulse, Respiratory distress, Presence of neurological deficit, Fluid resistant hemorrhagic shock, Audible bruit or palpable thrill, Signs of stroke/ cerebral ischemia. The presence of any of these hard signs indicates major neurovascular/ airway injury and is an indication for surgical exploration of the trauma region as soon as possible. Neck trauma is classified based on the different regions of the neck. Zone I: thoracic inlet to cricoid, associated with maximum mortality. It contains large vascular structures as well as the trachea and esophagus. Zone II: cricoid cartilage to the angle of mandible, most commonly prone to injury and most easily accessible for surgery. It contains the carotid and vertebral arteries, jugular veins, and structures of the aerodigestive tract. Zone III: angle of the mandible to the base of the skull. Structures within zone III include blood vessels that are difficult to expose surgically. Management: If the patient is hemodynamically unstable: neck exploration. If the patient is stable: Zone II injury: Conservative management. Zone I and Zone III: Angiography and angioembolization are indicated. If it fails, then neck exploration should be done.",

      "question": "A 38-year-old man was brought to the emergency department after suffering a stab injury to the lower chest.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of a patient with a stab injury and hypotension not responding to IV fluids indicates persistent hypotension due to ongoing hemorrhage and the next step in the management is to perform an eFAST. Cardiogenic shock or hemorrhagic shock are the most likely causes of persistent hypotension in a trauma patient. Ultrasound evaluation using eFAST to look for pericardium, pleural cavities, and abdomen in combination with plain radiographs of the chest and pelvis will usually identify the source of the bleed. In patients with persistent hypotension due to blunt trauma, the pelvis should be wrapped in a sheet for stabilization until radiography can be done. Evaluation of CVP or ultrasound of the IVC may further assist in distinguishing between cardiogenic and hypovolemic shock. It is mostly fatal if not controlled, and requires immediate management. Blood and plasma transfusions are provided in a ratio of 2:1. Patients with persistent hypotension requiring surgical intervention include: • Blunt trauma and massive hemothorax • Penetrating trauma • Hemoperitoneum • Gunshot injuries to the chest or abdomen • Penetrating weapon remaining in place. Other options: Options C and D: CECT can be done only when the patient is hemodynamically stable. Option B: Tube thoracostomy has no role in this patient's management since the X-ray shows clear lung fields.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Among the given options, eFAST (extended Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma) is least useful in diagnosing retroperitoneal hematoma, as the sensitivity of ultrasound for detecting retroperitoneal hematomas is extremely poor. FAST is a rapid, noninvasive bedside test that uses sonography to detect free fluid in the abdomen and assess patients for potential thoracoabdominal injuries. Technique: The patient is placed in a supine position. With a 3.5-5.0 MHz convex transducer, the following regions are scanned: Subxiphoid transverse view: assess for pericardial effusion and left lobe liver injuries; Longitudinal view of the right upper quadrant: assess for right liver injuries, right kidney injury, and Morison's pouch; Longitudinal view of the left upper quadrant: assess for splenic injury and left kidney injury; Transverse and longitudinal views of the suprapubic region: assess the bladder and pouch of Douglas. eFAST stands for extended FAST and incorporates left and right thoracic views to assess for pneumothorax and hemothorax. Computed Tomography (CT Scan) is the investigation of choice for retroperitoneal injury, but it can only be done in a hemodynamically stable patient.",

In hemodynamically stable patients, the investigation of choice is CECT or CT angiogram. Traumatic aortic injuries are commonly seen in deceleration injuries (e.g., road traffic accidents). The most common site of aortic injury is the isthmus, near the attachment of ligamentum arteriosum. Clinical features of aortic injuries: Hypotension, difference in blood pressure in bilateral limbs, absent pulse in the unilateral limb, widened mediastinum on chest x-ray. Management: Volume replacement: fluid therapy and blood transfusion, permissive hypotension: Beta-blockers, such as esmolol, immediate surgical repair: endovascular stenting, or open surgical repair with Dacron graft.",

      "question": "A young man was rushed to the casualty with multiple rib fractures. On examination, you notice a paradoxical movement of the chest, and the patient is diagnosed with respiratory failure. How would you manage him?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Chest tube drainage",

        "D": "Internal operative fixation of the fractured segments"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of flail chest with respiratory failure. Management of this condition is IPPV (invasive positive pressure ventilation). A flail chest occurs when a segment of the chest wall does not have bony continuity with the rest of the thoracic cage. This condition results from blunt trauma associated with multiple rib fractures, i.e., 2 adjacent ribs or 3 or more ribs fractured in two or more places. The blunt force required to disrupt the integrity of the thoracic cage typically produces an underlying pulmonary contusion as well. On inspiration, the loose segment of the chest wall is displaced inwards, and therefore, less air moves into the lungs. On expiration, the segment moves outwards. This is known as paradoxical respiration. The diagnosis is made clinically, not by radiography. To confirm, the paradoxical motion of a chest wall segment can be observed for several respiratory cycles and during coughing. Voluntary splinting as a result of pain, mechanically impaired chest wall movement, and the associated lung contusion are all causes of hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient is also at high risk of developing a pneumothorax or hemothorax. Treatment: • Chest strapping or splinting should be avoided. • Currently, treatment consists of oxygen administration, adequate analgesia (including opiates) or epidural analgesia, and physiotherapy. • IPPV (Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation) is reserved for patients developing respiratory failure despite adequate analgesia and oxygen. Treatment algorithm of treatment of flail chest with respiratory failure: Flail chest and respiratory failure Yes Major organ injury, lung contusion or inability to protect the airway Intubation and mechanical ventilation No Non-invasive mechanical ventilation Yes No Effective non-invasive mechanical ventilation Yes Chest wall instability, interfering with weaning Consider surgical fixation of the rib cage No Weaning when tolerated",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario is suggestive of a rib fracture. Strapping is not done for rib fractures because it prevents the patient from taking deep breaths. This can lead to lung collapse. The vital step in the management of rib fractures is to reduce pain and prevent the development of pneumonia. Rib fracture causes intense pain during breathing and increases the risk of pulmonary infections as the patient is not able to cough forcefully. In mild to moderate cases, pain can be managed by intravenous opioids. In severe cases, patients may require epidural analgesia. In addition to adequate analgesia, chest physiotherapy like deep breathing, frequent coughing, incentive spirometry should be encouraged in these patients. This prevents the development of pneumonia and lung collapse. When chest wall injuries result in respiratory failure, mechanical ventilation should be provided.",

        "D": "Massive hemothorax"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of trauma with decreased breath sounds and a hyper-resonant note on percussion indicates pneumothorax. The presence of tachycardia, hypotension, and elevated JVP is suggestive of tension pneumothorax. Tension pneumothorax develops when there is a parietal or visceral pleural tear. This tear acts as a one-way valve, i.e., air enters the pleural space from the lung or chest wall during inspiration but has no way to escape during expiration, leading to the collapse of the affected lung. It is characterized by chest pain, tachypnea, acute dyspnea, sudden onset hemodynamic compromise (tachycardia, hypotension, low O2 saturation, loss of consciousness), neck vein distention, tracheal deviation away from the side of injury, decreased chest movements on the affected side, hyper-resonance on percussion on the affected side, and absent or decreased breath sounds on the affected side. Tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis, and treatment should never be delayed awaiting radiological confirmation. Management includes: Immediate management: Needle decompression or needle thoracostomy with a wide-bore needle in the 5th intercostal space anterior to the mid-axillary line. In the pediatric age group, the needle thoracostomy location is at the 2nd intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line. Definitive management: Tube thoracostomy or chest tube insertion in the 5th intercostal space in the triangle of safety. The triangle of safety is bounded anteriorly by the lateral border of the pectoralis major, posteriorly by latissimus dorsi, and inferiorly by a horizontal line at the level of the nipple. Other options: Option A: Pericardial tamponade can mimic tension pneumothorax, but the absence of a tympanic note on percussion rules out its possibility. A patient with pericardial tamponade can present with hypotension, raised JVP, and muffled heart sounds (Beck's triad), with normal breath sounds and no tracheal shift. Option C: Dullness in percussion at the base of the left inferior angle of scapula in conjunction with tubular breath sounds (Ewart's sign), chest pain that improves while sitting upright and worsens when lying down, and pulsus paradoxus are indicative of pericardial effusion. Pericardial effusion develops into tamponade when the effusion leads to increased pressure, impairing ventricular filling and reducing cardiac output. Option D: Massive hemothorax is the accumulation of >1500 ml of blood or one-third or more of the patient's blood volume in the chest cavity. The patient will have collapsed neck veins, decreased breath sounds, and a dull note on percussion.",

Management of tension pneumothorax: Immediate management: Needle decompression or needle thoracostomy, i.e., insertion of a wide-bore needle in the 5th ICS anterior to the mid-axillary line. Definitive management: Tube thoracostomy or chest tube insertion in the 5th ICS in the triangle of safety.

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of hemodynamic instability and muffled heart sounds are suggestive of cardiac tamponade. The entry wound is sealed on only 3 sides with an occlusive dressing if a pneumothorax is suspected. When there is a pneumothorax with a sucking wound, the immediate step is to cover the wound with gauze pieces and tape on 3 sides. As the patient breathes in, the dressing occludes the wound, preventing air from entering into the thoracic cavity. During exhalation, the open end of the dressing allows air to escape from the pleural space. This is known as a flutter-valve effect. Following this, a chest tube is inserted away from the site of the wound. Cardiac tamponade must be differentiated from tension pneumothorax in a patient with hemodynamic instability and distended neck veins. Cardiac tamponade is characterized by Beck's triad: muffled heart sounds, distended neck veins, and hypotension. Tension pneumothorax is characterized by absent breath sounds and hyper-resonance on percussion on the affected side. These are not present in a patient with cardiac tamponade. Diagnosis of cardiac tamponade can be done by eFAST, which shows fluid in the pericardial sac. Definitive management is emergency thoracotomy or sternotomy.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "In a blast injury, the liver is the least vulnerable to blast wave (primary blast) injury. Blast injury is a complex type of physical trauma resulting from direct or indirect exposure to an explosion. Primary blast injuries result from the rapid overpressure or shock waves produced by an explosion. These injuries result from the dramatic changes in barometric pressure projecting outwards from the point of detonation. They predominantly cause damage to air-filled hollow organs of the body from rapid pressure change (barotrauma). This includes the middle ear, lungs, and GI tract. The most sensitive and most frequently injured hollow organs are the tympanic membranes > lungs. Blast damage to the lungs is the most common cause of life-threatening injury following an explosion. Solid organs are the most resistant to blast injuries as the parenchymal disruption requires very high levels of overpressure. Classification of blast injuries: Primary blast due to air pressure from the blast shockwave (overpressure), Secondary blast fragments from the blast, following a detonation, Tertiary blast gross movements of persons, objects, or infrastructure by the blast wind, Miscellaneous causes penetrating/fragmentation, blunt trauma, exposure to explosive products or toxic substances, environmental contaminant, Quaternary blast the intentional addition of biological or radioactive material to the explosive device, Quinary blast. Examples: Tympanic membrane injury, blast lung, intestinal blast injury, all penetrating injuries, blunt and crush injuries, traumatic amputation, burns, inhalation injury, radiation sickness, infection.",

      "explanation": "The spleen is the most common organ involved in blunt trauma injury of the abdomen. In blunt trauma, organs that cannot yield to impact by elastic deformation are most likely to be injured, namely, the solid organs (liver, spleen, and kidneys). For penetrating trauma, organs with the largest surface area when viewed from the front are most prone to injury (small bowel, liver, and colon). Additionally, since bullets and knives usually follow straight lines, adjacent structures are commonly injured (e.g., the pancreas and duodenum). Deceleration injures the pedicled organs by shearing the organs from their points of attachment to the retroperitoneum (intestines and kidney). The most commonly injured bowel in cases of blunt trauma of the abdomen is the jejunum.",

Thepressure can be applied either digitally or with the use of a soft clamp.Rapid control of the vessels entering the porta hepatis can be obtained by compressing them inthe free edge of the lesser omentum.Porta hepatis is a deep, transverse fissure that is situated on the inferior surface of the rightlobe of the liver.Structures entering at porta hepatis:• Portal vein•• Hepatic artery•Hepatic nervous plexusStructures exiting the porta hepatis:• Right and left hepatic bile ducts•• LymphaticsThe images attached below shows the porta hepatis and the gif demonstrates the pringlesmanoeuvre.178PortahepatisLymphaticsPorta hepatis.HepatoduodenalligamentCommonbile ductHepaticarteryPortal veinPorta hepatisOMARROWPringle maneuverMARROWOMARROWPortal veinHepatic arteryLobar nervesBile duct1794 P's in the management of liver injuries are:• Push- Compression of the edges of the laceration•Pringle- Applying pressure on the portal triad••Plug the defects with silicon tubes•Pack- Apply packs in and around the liver to arrest bleedingGeneral guidelines for the management of blunt trauma to the liver:• Patients who are haemodynamically unstable will require an immediate laparotomy for damagecontrol resuscitation.• For the patient who is haemodynamically stable, imaging by CT should be performed to furtherevaluate the nature of the injury.• Most patients with a blunt liver injury who are haemodynamically stable can be managedconservatively.•• The indication for discontinuing conservative treatment is the development of haemodynamicinstability, evidence of ongoing blood loss despite correction of any underlying coagulopathy andthe development of signs of generalised peritonitis.•Interventional radiology has an important role in the management of liver trauma andembolisation to control hepatic artery bleeding is safe and effective in a stable patient with noevidence of hollow viscus perforation.180",
