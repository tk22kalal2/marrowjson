      "explanation": "The given history with the image showing an ulcer over the face with pearly, rolled-out borderspoints to a diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma.Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is an epithelial tumor arising from basal cells. It is the most commontype of skin cancer most commonly seen over the face, above the line joining corner of the mouth,and lobule of the ear. Risk factors for BCC include ultraviolet radiation (strongest risk factor), age40-80 years with excessive sun exposure, light-skinned people, and exposure to arseniccompounds, coal tar, aromatic hydrocarbons, and infrared light. It is more common in males thanfemales. It is also associated with syndromes such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Gorlin'ssyndrome.Features of BCC include:•Pearly nodule with rolled border•Tortuous telangiectatic vessels• Surface which can get ulcerated with raised and beaded edge, often with a central depression orumbilication.• Bleeding on minor traumaBCC has various subtypes such as nodular (most common type), pigmented, nodulocystic,morphoeic, infiltrative, and fibroepithelioma of Pinkus.1257It is locally aggressive and can erode the bone or facial sinuses. It rarely metastasizes via lymphnodes.The occasional presence of melanin in the nodular variant of BCC (pigmented BCC) may lead toconfusion with melanoma.Depending upon the type of the lesion, a shave, punch or excisional biopsy may be employed fordiagnosis. X-ray or CT may be needed if there is a local invasion. Histology shows peripheralpalisading of cells.•Treatment:Surgical: Wide excision (4-6 mm clearance) with a skin graft or flap or primary suturing• Mohs' surgery for BCC close to the eyes, nose, or ear to preserve more tissue.• Non-surgical: Radiotherapy, vismodegib and sonedegib.Other options:Option A: Dermatofibrosarcoma, also known as dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is arare, slow-growing, well-differentiated primary fibrosarcoma of the skin, associated with increasedproduction of platelet-derived growth factor-beta. It presents as a protuberant nodule within afirm, indurated plaque that can ulcerate. They are locally aggressive tumors with high recurrencerates. Treatment is wide excision and Mohs microscopic surgery. Imatinib is used forunresectable, metastatic, and recurrent tumors. The given image below shows a DFSP near theumbilicus.Option B: Marjolin's ulcer is a painless, slow-growing, locally malignant, well-differentiatedsquamous cell carcinoma that occurs in a chronic scar (burns scar, scar of venous ulcer). Itpresents as an indurated, non-tender ulcer with raised and everted edges with scarring in thesurrounding area with marked fibrosis. The ulcer can spread to the lymph nodes when it reachesthe normal skin. A wedge biopsy and MRI of the region involved confirm the diagnosis.Management is by wide excision, for larger ulcers, amputation is done. The given image belowshows a marjolin's ulcer of the leg.1258Option D: Naevus is a common benign neoplasm caused due to mutations in the components ofthe RAS signaling pathway. It has various types, such as congenital naevus, blue naevus, Spitznaevus, halo naevus, and dysplastic naevus. The given image below shows a patient with multipledysplastic nevi.",

It arises from the nail matrix,most commonly in the great toe or thumb.1263Hutchinson's nail sign is an important clinical clue to subungual melanoma. It is characterized bythe extension of brown or black pigment from the nail bed, matrix, and nail plate to the adjacentcuticle and proximal or lateral nail folds. It is also associated with nail dystrophy.Note: Pseudo-Hutchison's sign is a reflection of the pigmentation of the nail bed and nail matrixthrough the transparent nail folds.Option A: Subungal hematoma is a close differential of subungual melanoma. It is seen secondaryto trauma which causes bleeding and resultant hematoma formation and pigmentation. It isimportant to note that the features of Hutchinson's nail sign are not seen with subungualhematoma.Option B: Nodular melanoma is a condition where malignant melanoma cells proliferatedownwards through the skin - this is known as vertical growth. The lesion presents asa nodule that has been rapidly enlarging.1264Option D: Lentigo maligna is an early form of melanoma, in which the malignant cells areconfined to the tissue of origin, the epidermis, hence it is often reported as in-situ melanoma.Note: Subungual melanoma can be either superficial spreading melanoma or acral lentiginousmelanoma. A difference of opinion has been noted in Bailey and Love, 27th ed. where it has beenmentioned that melanoma under the fingernail is usually superficial spreadingmelanoma. However, most dermatology textbooks including the Rooks 9th ed. and Fitzpatrick's9th ed and several research articles mentioned subungual melanoma as a variant of acrallentiginous melanoma.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The order of prognosis for types of melanoma from better to worse is:Lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM) and acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) &gt; superficialspreading melanoma (SSM) &gt; nodular melanoma (NM)The LMM and ALM both have long horizontal phases. As a result of this, there will be more timeto detect them before they enter the vertical phase of growth. Thus LMM and ALM have a betterprognosis than other subtypes.The SSM has an intermediate prognosis, as the horizontal phase is rapidly followed by the verticalphase.The NM has the worst prognosis, as there is no horizontal phase and it starts with a verticalgrowth phase. This leads to a greater average tumor thickness.1266",

      "explanation": "Wide local excision with a resection margin of 2 cm along with sentinel lymph node biopsy(SLNB) will be recommended for melanomas invading to a depth &gt; 2mm.Recommended margins of wide local excision:Wide local excision with SLNB is preferred for early-stage tumours. SLNB should be performedfor lesions &gt;1mm in depth. If SLNB is positive or if nodes are clinically positive, lymph nodedissection should be performed.SLN biopsy is more challenging in the head and neck than in other regions because of the richlymphatic drainage network, and the false-negative rate for SLN biopsy is generally higher formelanomas in these locations. Cross-sectional imaging, such as with a single-photon emission CT,helps to identify the exact anatomic location of the SLNs more accurately.DepthMarginIn sit0.5 Cum<1 m1 cmm1-21-2 Cmmm>2-4mm2 cm>4 mm2 cm",

Other sites include theperineum, scrotum, perianal skin, and penis.Extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) can be primary or secondary.Primary EMPD is more common and occurs in the absence of an underlying malignancy,thought to arise from intraepidermal parts of apocrine glands or from pluripotent cells from theepidermis.• Secondary EMPD arises from an underlying adnexal carcinoma or internal malignancy due tothe epidermotropic spread of malignant cells from the underlying tumor.Visceral malignancies associated with EMPD are carcinomas of the colon, rectum, bladder,urethra, cervix, and prostate. The patient presents with well-defined, moist, erythematous scalyplaques and severe pruritis. Lichenification and excoriations may also be seen.Diagnosis is confirmed by punch, wedge, or excisional skin biopsy. A systemic workup should alsobe done to identify any underlying malignancy and they include colonoscopy, cystoscopy,colposcopy, and pelvic examination with pap smear in females.Treatment:• Mohs microscopic surgery with 5 cm margin clearance• Radiotherapy•Topical 5-fluorouracil and imiquimod•Chemotherapy•Photodynamic therapyThe given image below shows extramammary Paget's disease of the vulva.1269",

It is a form of intraepidermal adenocarcinoma.Extramammary Paget's disease usually presents in the sixth to eighth decades of life. It may occurin the genital or perianal regions, or in cutaneous sites rich in apocrine glands such as theaxilla. Approximately 25% of the cases are associated with an underlying in situ or invasiveneoplasm.It most commonly presents with pruritus. The clinical appearance is similar to mammary Paget'sDisease. Scattered areas of erosion and white scale can give rise to a \"strawberries and cream\"appearance.
