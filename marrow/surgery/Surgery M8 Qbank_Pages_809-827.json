      "explanation": "Pancreas divisum is the most common congenital anomaly of the pancreas.During embryogenesis, the developing pancreatic ducts usually fuse in such a way that most of thedorsal duct drains into the proximal part of the ventral duct. The proximal portion of the dorsalduct usually persists as an accessory duct.In about 10% of the population, there is a failure of fusion of the dorsal and ventral pancreaticbuds leading to a condition called pancreatic divisum (pancreas divisum). Pancreatic drainage isaccomplished mainly through the accessory papilla.Since most of the pancreatic exocrine secretions exit through the dorsal duct, the pancreasdivisum can lead to a partial obstruction due to the small minor papilla, leading to thedevelopment of relapsing acute or chronic pancreatitisDorsalbileGalanlagebladderVentralanlageDuodenumNormalPancresOMARROWLivergutporsal anlageVentral ankageGall bladderMidgutDorsalvontraMinorcommon bile ductAccessonsduct ofSantoriniMein &APSTRMajor papillaCommon bile ductduct OTVinumal duct of",

      "explanation": "MRCP is more advantageous than ERCP in diagnosing pancreatic divisum. This is because,MRCP can delineate the entire dorsal pancreatic duct, whereas ERCP can assess only the ventralduct on cannulation of the major duodenal papilla.The diagnosis of pancreatic divisum can also be made by EUS, or ERCP, augmented by injectionof secretin if necessary.Endoscopic sphincterotomy and stenting of the minor papilla relieve the symptoms.

In the first 72 hours, CT mayunderestimate the extent of necrosis. Indications of CT scan in pancreatitis are•• Diagnostic uncertaintyIn patients with severe acute pancreatitis, to distinguish interstitial from necrotizing pancreatitis• In patients with organ failure, signs of sepsis or progressive clinical deterioration• When a localized complication is suspected, such as fluid collection, pseudocyst, or apseudoaneurysmOption C: For severe acute pancreatitis with systemic inflammatory response syndrome andpossible organ impairment, the modified marshall scoring can be used to assess the severity oforgan failure.

Revised Atlanta classification recommends themodified Marshall scoring system as the main tool in determining organ failure.Option D: Current evidence confirms that the administration of enteral nutrition is beneficial forthe treatment of severe acute pancreatitis.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Infected pancreatic necrosis should not be managed conservatively with antibiotics alone becauseof the high risk of multiorgan failure and death.CT scan has to be performed in patients with severe acute pancreatitis, organ failure, sepsis, andin patients with clinical deterioration despite the treatment:•• If the CT scan shows the presence of sterile pancreatic necrosis medical management isrecommended.• If the CT scan shows the presence of necrosis with evidence of infection, then ultrasound orCT-guided aspiration of the fluid has to be done and the fluid is sent for staining and culture.Infected pancreatic necrosis is treated by the administration of intravenous antibiotics (preferablycarbapenems) and percutaneous drainage of the infected fluid. Pancreatic necrosectomy is beconsidered in the patients if the clinical condition worsens despite percutaneous drainage.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Pancreatic pseudocyst is seen as a sequela of interstitial edematous pancreatitis, which is a non-necrotic collection. Necrotizing pancreatitis usually leads to acute necrotic collection (ANC) and walled-off necrosis (on encapsulation of ANC). Based on the revised Atlanta classification, peripancreatic fluid and its collections can be classified into 4 different types based on their morphology and time of presentation. Interstitial Edematous Pancreatitis (IEP), Acute Peripancreatic Fluid Collection (APFC): non-necrotic fluid collection presenting within 4 weeks, pancreatic pseudocyst: non-necrotic fluid collection when it undergoes encapsulation (after 4 weeks), and Necrotizing Pancreatitis. Acute Necrotic Collection (ANC): necrotic fluid collection presenting within 4 weeks, Walled-Off Necrosis (WON): necrotic fluid collection when it undergoes encapsulation (after 4 weeks). ANC, APFC, WON, and pancreatic pseudocysts can be infected or non-infected. Collections that contain non-liquefied material or show the presence of gas are more likely to be infected. Duration since onset: <4 weeks after onset (not encapsulated), undergoes encapsulation → 4 weeks after onset (encapsulated): IEP → APFC, Necrotizing pancreatitis → ANC → Pancreatic pseudocyst/WON.",

      "question": "A 12-year-old girl was rushed to the casualty after she was injured by a bicycle's handlebar inthe abdomen. She complains of severe epigastric pain. On examination, bruises are seen inthe epigastrium. Her CT scan is given below. Which of the following statements is false abouther condition?815",
      "options": {
        "A": "Damage control surgery is done.",
        "B": "Distal pancreatectomy will be the definitive management.",
        "C": "Surgery is indicated if the main pancreatic duct is disrupted.",
        "D": "Amylase levels are highly sensitive"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with a handlebar injury and the CT scan showing transection of thebody of the pancreas are suggestive pancreatic injury. Plasma amylase levels are not sensitive inpancreatic injuries.The most common mechanism of pancreatic injury in children is blunt trauma (because of thedecreased amount of fat and incomplete protection of the rib cage). In adults, penetrating injuriesare the most common cause. Involvement of other organs is also likely to be seen.Direct compression of the epigastrium against the vertebral column and a blunt object (handlebar)is typically seen after bicycle injuries. The most common segment of the pancreas affected is thebody.Patients usually present with epigastric pain. In some cases, a delayed presentation may be due toleakage of pancreatic fluids.The modality of choice is the CT scan of the abdomen. If there is doubt about duct disruption, anurgent ERCP or MRCP should be done.Surgery is indicated if the main pancreatic duct is disrupted. A damage control procedure withpacking and drainage should be performed initially and the patient referred for definitive surgeryafter stabilization.•Definitive management includes:• Distal pancreatectomy - If the body or tail is involved• External drainage - If the head of the pancreas is involved• Pancreatoduodenectomy - If the pancreatic head and duodenum is involved827",
