Abdominalradiography shows transverse or right colonic dilation of &gt;6 cm and loss of haustrations. It isusually associated with ulcerative colitis as indicated by history of chronic bloody diarrhoea.It can be triggered by electrolyte imbalance and narcotics which interfere with gut motility.Features of secondary bacterial infecton and sepsis may be present. It can be complicated byintestinal perforation.It usually resolves with supportive treatment (correcting electrolyte imbalance, fluids, and bowelrest) and medical therapy which includes glucocorticoids, anti-inflammatory drugs, andantibiotics. However, an urgent colectomy is indicated in patients who do not show signs ofimprovement.●Indications for urgent surgery include:•• Frank intraperitoneal peritonitis, secondary to perforation• Life-threatening hemorrhage or increasing transfusion requirements⚫ Worsening systemic toxicity• Worsening colonic dilatationOther options:Option B: Volvulus occurs when the air-filled segment of the colon twists around the mesentery.The sigmoid colon is the most commonly involved part of the large intestine (90%). The patientcan present with abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting. X-ray abdomen shows a bent innertube or coffee bean appearance.D521Option C: Ogilvie syndrome, also known as colonic pseudo-obstruction is a functional disorderwith colonic dilatation without mechanical obstruction. It occurs commonly in hospitalizedpatients and is associated with narcotics, bed rest and comorbid disease. X-ray shows dilatation ofthe colon (predominantly transverse colon) with absent mechanical obstruction.SUPINEOption D: Pneumatosis intestinalis is the presence of gas within the bowel wall seen in any part ofthe GI tract but most commonly in the jejunum.

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and X-ray film showing saw-toothed appearance of the colon aresuggestive of colonic diverticulosis.

Thecondition is usually asymptomatic until complications arise. They may be detected incidentally.On a barium X-ray, the colon with diverticular disease will have a saw-toothed appearance.Colonic diverticula are more often acquired than congenital. They are common in developedcountries that have a low fiber diet. A low fiber diet results in low stool volume. As the colongenerates higher intraluminal pressure to propel smaller volumes of stools, low stool volumescause an increase in colonic wall tension and segmentation of the colon.Prolonged colonic contractions and high pressures (directed radially along the colonic wall)results in the formation of pulsion diverticula. The sigmoid colon is the most common site.Note: True diverticulum involves the herniation of all the layers of the intestine whereas falsediverticulum involves the herniation of only the mucosa and submucosa.Vascular structureMesenteric TaeniaEpiploic AppendageOMARROWAnti-mesenteric TaeniaDiverticulumAnti-mesenteric Area",

The clinical features include:• Marked abdominal distention530• Abdominal pain• Obstipation•• Nausea and vomiting etc.On examination, a palpable tympanic swelling in the midline or the left side may be seen. If thereis strangulation or perforation of the obstructed bowel segment, peritoneal signs (rigidity,rebound tenderness etc.) can be present.Radiological findings include caecal dilatation, single air-fluid level, and absence of gas in thedistal colon. On X-ray abdomen, the apex of the cecal volvulus points towards the left upperquadrant (vs apex pointing towards the right upper quadrant in sigmoid volvulus)CECT abdomen is the investigation of choice that shows a whirl sign (also seen in the midgutvolvulus).Management of cecal volvulus includes supportive therapy with nasogastric tube, iv fluids,antibiotics etc. and early surgical intervention.• Perforated or strangulated cecal volvulus should be treated with right hemicolectomy• If there is no sign of perforation or strangulation, either cecopexy or right hemicolectomy can beperformed.Option B: Sigmoid volvulus (image shown below) is a cause of large bowel obstruction and occurswhen the sigmoid colon twists on the sigmoid mesocolon. X-ray abdomen shows a large, dilatedloop of the colon, often with a few air-fluid levels. Specific signs include the coffee bean signand the absence of rectal gas. On X-ray abdomen, the apex of the sigmoid volvulus points towardsthe right upper quadrant.Option C: Toxic megacolon (image shown below) is defined as the dilatation of the transversecolon to a diameter of more than 6 cm. It is usually associated with severe ulcerative colitis. It canbe triggered by electrolyte imbalance and narcotics as they interfere with gut motility.531LOption D: Fecal retention is an accumulation of a large amount of stool within any bowel segment,most commonly within the colon usually due to chronic constipation. A colonic distention withfecal material is often called fecal loading on the radiograph. It can be complicated by fecalimpaction and subsequent bowel obstruction.",

It may occur withmany different conditions, including embolism from cardiac disease, low-flow states such ascongestive heart failure, sepsis, and vasopressor use. Major vascular surgery (both open andendovascular repair), especially involving the abdominal aorta, is a well-known risk factor fordeveloping ischemic colitis.Although any area of the colon may be affected, the watershed areas of the splenic flexure(Griffith's point) and the rectosigmoid (Sudeck's point) are the most prone to ischemia because ofthe often incomplete anastomoses of the marginal artery in these locations. The next mostcommon area afflicted is the cecum, secondary to low blood flow in the terminal branches of theileocolic artery.Splenic flexure (also known as Griffith's point) is a watershed area between the superior andinferior mesenteric arteries.Sudeck point is a watershed area between the sigmoid arterial branch from the inferior mesentericartery and the superior rectal artery (branch of Inferior mesentric artery).532Arterial blood supply to the large bowelshowing the potential sites of ischemiaOMARROWSuperior and Inferiormesenteric arterywatershedSuperior mesentericarteryInferior mesentericarteryInferior mesentericand hypogastricartery watershedThe marginal artery of Drummond runs parallel to the colon, connecting the SMA and IMAcirculation - the majority of blood flow to the left and sigmoid colon in case of occlusion of theIMA.Arc of Riolan is a variable collateral vessel that connects the SMA (middle colic vessel) to the IMA(left colic).Middle colicarteryRight colicarteryIleocolicarteryBlood supply of large intestineOMARROWMarginal arteryof DrummondArc of-RiolanSuperior-mesentericartery-InferiormesentericarteryLeft colicarterySigmoidal arteriesSuperior rectal artery",
