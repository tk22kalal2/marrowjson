Marjolin's ulcer may also develop in chronic long standing venous ulcers but are not seenin chronic lymphedema.1237Initially, the lymphedema is soft and pits on the pressure but with time the skin becomesthickened and non-pitting due to fibrosis, dermal thickening, and hyperkeratosis.Frequent episodes of lymphangitis and cellulitis may occur. This is due to loss of local immunedefense mechanisms. Chronic eczema, the fungal infection of skin and nails, fissuring, verrucae,and papillae (warts) are frequently seen in advanced disease.Rarely malignancy (lymphangiosarcoma or angiosarcoma) may occur in chronic lymphedema.This neoplastic transformation of blood vessels and lymphatics is called Stewart-Treves syndrome.",

Other sitesinclude the middle compartment and hilar nodes.Primary mediastinal lymphoma is an uncommon type of lymphoma. Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL),primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and T-lymphoblastic lymphoma are the mostcommon primary mediastinal lymphomas. In about 50% of patients who have both Hodgkin's andNon-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, the mediastinum may be the primary site.Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome refers to symptoms produced by the obstruction of blood flowthrough the SVC by the enlarging mediastinal mass, resulting in symptoms of dyspnea, facial andupper-extremity edema, cough, chest pain, and dysphagia.Video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) is used to obtain a biopsy of the mediastinal mass forconfirmation and diagnosis.Chemotherapy with six cycles of R-CHOP regimen is preferred. Rituximab is a chimericmonoclonal anti-CD20 antibody and has become a standard component of treating all B-celllymphoma histologies that express CD20.Note: Thymoma is the most common mediastinal tumor in adults (overall).",

      "explanation": "The given image depicts a lymphangioma, also known as cystic hygroma. They are brilliantlytransilluminant.Lymphangiomas are congenital benign tumors of the lymphatic system. They are the isolatedcystic mass of lymphatic tissue that has the ability to produce lymph. Over time the tumorenlarges due to the accumulation of lymph within the cyst.Types of lymphangiomas:Simple or capillary lymphangioma: They occur subcutaneously in the head, neck, and axilla.They may also occur within the internal organs and connective tissues in the thoracic andabdominal cavities.• Cavernous lymphangioma or cystic hygroma: They also occur in the neck or axilla. Rarely theymay occur in retroperitoneum.1238Treatment includes surgical excision of the tumor and image-guided sclerotherapy.If there is any residual lymphatic malformation after the treatment, then a conservative excisionor unroofing of the cyst is done. It may be combined with sclerosing therapy or repeated partialexcisions.Note: The terms lymphangioma and cystic hygromas are older terms. They are now calledlymphatic malformations.",

Itis a common complication of breast cancer treatment involving axillary lymph nodedissection and radiotherapy. Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) reduces the risk of1239lymphedema significantly.Clinical signs and symptoms are observed in the ipsilateral arm. A significant increase in the limbsize due to swelling is seen. Other symptoms are heaviness, tightness, numbness, tingling, limbfatigue, and reduced limb mobility.Diagnosis is predominantly based on the clinical swelling of the arm. The girth of the affected arm&gt;2 centimeters than the normal limb, a 200-mL or more increase in limb volume, or a 5% orgreater limb volume change are other diagnostic criteria.Management:Limb elevation, elastic arm stockings, and pneumatic compression devices can help reduceswelling.Dry skin can be seen due to fluid accumulation, which can lead to cellulitis/skin infections. Usinga low pH water-based moisturizer is helpful.Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) by a therapist followed by simple lymphatic drainage (SLD) bythe patient daily aids interstitial fluid evacuation.Benzpyrones and flavonoids are some naturally occurring substances that may be of use to treatlymphedema.Surgical options are lymphaticovenular anastomosis, liposuction, and debulking.Other options:Option B: Stewart-Treves syndrome refers to lymphangiosarcoma seen in chronic long-standinglymphedema following mastectomy (more than 10 years). They present as single/multiplebluish-red skin and subcutaneous nodules. They can ulcerate and hemorrhage.Option C: Axillary venous thrombosis or Paget-Schrotter disease is seen in patients doing rigorousexercise and in weightlifters. The subclavian vein is compressed at the thoracic outlet. Painfulswelling of the arm is observed.Option D: Cellulitis usually presents with an ulcer and the skin is erythematous, swollen, andpainful.
