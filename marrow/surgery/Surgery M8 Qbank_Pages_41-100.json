      "explanation": "All the given options can be used to stop esophageal variceal bleeding. Image A shows the Sengstaken-Blakemore tube. It has 3 lumens - one aspiration port and 2 inflation balloons. They are: \n      • Gastric aspiration port\n      • Gastric balloon port\n      • Esophageal balloon port\n   The gastric balloon is inflated and tension is applied to the gastroesophageal junction. If this does not control the hemorrhage, the esophageal balloon is inflated as well, compressing the venous plexus between them. Only gastric contents can be aspirated.\n   Scheme of using the Sengstaken-Blakemore tube:\n   Gastric aspiration port\n   Esophageal balloon port\n   Gastric balloon port\n   Traction\n   Esophageal balloon (inflated): 40 mmHg\n   Gastric balloon (inflated): at least 300 mL of air\n   Gastric aspiration channel\n   Nasal cavity\n   Pharynx\n   Esophagus\n   Stomach\n   Image B shows the Minnesota tube. It has 4 openings - 2 inflation tubes and 2 suction tubes, i.e., both gastric and esophageal aspiration ports are present, which allows the aspiration of both gastric and esophageal contents.\n   Images C and D both show an upper GI endoscope. They are used to identify the source of bleeding and once identified, sclerotherapy and endoscopic variceal banding are performed, which have been shown to control hemorrhage effectively.\n   Banding has a lower rate of complications. If bleeding does not stop by banding/sclerotherapy, balloon tamponade should be tried.\n   The protocol for the management of esophageal varices is given below.\n   Management of acute variceal bleeding:\n   Variceal bleeding suspected based on history\n   Airway, Breathing, Circulation\n   Start octreotide or vasopressin infusion\n   Prophylactic antibiotics followed by upper GI endoscopy\n   Variceal bleeding confirmed\n   Endoscopic band ligation (or sclerotherapy)\n   Yes\n   Bleeding stopped?\n   No\n   - Octreotide/vasopressin for 3-5 days\n   - Antibiotics continued for 7 days\n   - Repeat endoscopic banding every 10-14 days until eliminated\n   Balloon tamponade\n   Consider TIPS or surgical shunt if TIPS unavailable or failed",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Bipolar diathermy is more effective than monopolar diathermy in preventing electrosurgical injury during laparoscopic surgery. Option A: During laparoscopic surgery, an artificial pneumoperitoneum is produced by insufflation of the abdominal cavity with CO2 through a temporary port created by carefully perforating the abdominal wall and peritoneum. As a common practice, blind insertion of a Veress needle is performed to enter the peritoneal cavity. However, in patients with prior abdominal surgeries, there is a higher chance of bowel adhesions and bowel wall injury during blind insertion of the Veress needle. Therefore, the Hasson approach is used for direct visualization while establishing intraperitoneal access. Option C: Clot formation may take place during laparoscopic surgery as a result of intraoperative bleeding. The routine use of 5000-7000 units of heparin per liter of irrigation fluid helps to avoid the formation of clots. Option D: If there is no contraindication for enteral feeding (e.g., bowel resection) and no sign of ileus postoperatively, oral feeding can be initiated 4-6 hours after surgery. Initially, a liquid diet is initiated, and if well-tolerated, light meals can be initiated.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The image is that of a Veress needle and trocar which is involved in blind puncture of the peritoneum. There are two methods used for the creation of a pneumoperitoneum: the closed method and the open method. The closed method using the Veress needle has a small but significant potential for intestinal or vascular injury on the introduction of the needle or trocar. Proper placement of the needle can be determined by the inability to re-aspirate injected saline. The normal insufflation rate is 4-6 litres/min. The use of the open technique for creating a pneumoperitoneum avoids the morbidity related to a blind puncture. To achieve this, a 1 cm vertical or transverse incision is made at the level of the umbilicus, stay sutures are applied, and the fascia is dissected. Free penetration into the abdominal cavity is confirmed by the gentle introduction of a finger. A Hasson trocar is inserted and anchored, and pneumoperitoneum is created. This is the Hasson or modified Hasson approach. This method is preferred for patients who have undergone previous abdominal surgeries as the small bowel may be adherent to the undersurface of the abdominal wound.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Romo Vac drain, depicted in the image, is a closed type of drain commonly used after mastectomy. Drains are placed at surgical sites to freely collect the air or fluids that may accumulate. This enhances wound healing by preventing the formation of unnecessary cavities. Drains are prophylactic in elective surgeries and therapeutic in emergency surgeries. Drains can be: Open - They are based on the principle of gravity; Semi-open - Their action is based on capillary effect; Closed - They carry out their actions through suction. Suction drains are commonly used in chest, breast, abdominal, thyroid, and plastic surgeries. They remove intraperitoneal secretions, anastomotic leaks, and blood from hemorrhage at the surgical site. Romo Vac drain is a negative suction drain, a closed drain kept in the subcutaneous tissue. Romo Vac drain is indicated in modified radical mastectomy, subcutaneous swelling excision, and amputations. Special types of drains: Chest drains are connected to an underwater seal to aid the exit of air from the pleural cavity. They are used in pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and hemothorax. After surgical exploration of the bile duct, the sphincter of Oddi goes into spasm. To facilitate drainage of bile, a T-tube may be used. Drain insertion site care: The site of insertion of the drain is kept clean by drying and patting the drain insertion site with a clean towel after a bath. The dressing is changed daily with folded gauze pieces placed below and above the drain site. Removal of drains: The catheter at the site is milked for residual collections. It is then clamped and the suture holding the catheter is cut. The tube is then gently pulled out and any clots at the perforation end are removed. The time of removal of drains for various conditions is as given below. Drains used in surgeries like thyroidectomy are usually removed within 24 hours. Their main purpose is to cover postoperative bleeding. In a mastectomy, a drain is placed for 5 days to collect serous collections. Drains used to cover the colorectal anastomoses are placed for 5-7 days. Common bile duct T-tube drains are usually placed for 10 days. Drains for infections are removed when the infection subsides or when the content of the drain is minimal. After the drain is removed, a folded gauze is placed over the drain insertion area. The dressing can be removed after 24 hours. The patient may be given an antibiotic ointment to apply over the area for a week.",

The Trendelenburg and reverse Trendelenburg positions are used in surgeries that are required to move the abdominal viscera, such as the small bowel, away from the operative field. Restraints and sideboards are placed to prevent the patient from sliding from the bed. In laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the patient is placed in a reverse Trendelenburg position slightly rotated to the left. This exposes the fundus of the gallbladder, which is retracted towards the diaphragm. Other options: Option A: Lloyd Davies's position is a 30-degree Trendelenburg position with the hips flexed at 15 degrees. It is used for rectal and anal canal surgeries like low anterior resection and abdominoperineal resection. It can cause compartment syndrome of the calves. Option B: Jackknife position is a modified prone position where the patient's hips are supported on a pillow and the table is flexed at a 90-degree angle with the head and feet at a lower level. It is not used anymore due to the chest compression causing impaired ventilation leading to positional asphyxia. It was used for hemorrhoids and fissure surgery.",

      "question": "Which of the following is a false statement regarding robotic surgery?",
      "options": {
        "A": "It is associated with less blood loss compared to laparoscopic surgery",
        "B": "Robotic surgery cuts down the operating time significantly",
        "C": "The learning curve is longer with robotic surgery",
        "D": "It is associated with a shorter length of hospital stay"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Even though robotic surgery has multiple advantages, the operating time is increased significantly compared to laparoscopic or open surgery. Advantages of robotic surgery include: 3D vision, tremor reduction, scaling of movements, finer dissection and suturing, less intraoperative bleeding, reduction in the length of hospital stay, and reduction of wound complications. Disadvantages of robotic surgery include: it is more expensive than other minimally invasive procedures, longer operative time, longer learning curve, and loss of tactile feedback.
