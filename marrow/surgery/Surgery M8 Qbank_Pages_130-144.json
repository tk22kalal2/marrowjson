        "D": "Amylase levels more than 175 units/dL is a positive finding"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The presence of more than 500 white cells/mm^3 in blunt trauma indicates a positive finding of diagnostic peritoneal lavage. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage detects the presence of intraperitoneal blood. Its use has decreased to virtually nil at many centers with the advent of the FAST examination. Indications for diagnostic peritoneal lavage are: Abdominal pain or tenderness, low abdominal rib fractures, unexplained hypotension, spinal or pelvic fractures, paraplegia or quadriplegia, and assessment hampered by altered mental status due to neurologic injury or intoxication. Procedure: It is performed through a small infraumbilical incision with the placement of the catheter under direct vision. The supraumbilical approach is indicated in pregnant patients and those with pelvic fractures. Aspiration of at least 10 mL of gross blood is an indication for laparotomy. If no blood is aspirated, a catheter is placed and 1 L of Ringer lactate solution is instilled into the peritoneal cavity and then allowed to drain by gravity. At least 200 mL of lavage fluid should be recovered to allow for accurate interpretation. Disadvantages: Neither qualitative nor quantitative, cannot identify the source of hemorrhage, relatively small amounts of intraperitoneal bleeding may result in a positive study, may not detect small and large injuries to the diaphragm, and cannot rule out injury to the bowel or retroperitoneal organs.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "A contrast-enhanced CT scan is the best diagnostic modality (gold standard) for stable patients with blunt trauma to the abdomen. It is a non-invasive and sensitive investigation. It can identify hemorrhage, intra-abdominal as well as retroperitoneal organ injury. However, performing CECT is time-consuming (when compared to FAST) and therefore it can be used only in stable patients. FAST ultrasound is a limited examination directed to look for intraperitoneal fluid or pericardial injury as a marker of the underlying injury. The best imaging modality for hemodynamically unstable patients with blunt trauma of the abdomen is FAST.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The left lower quadrant is not assessed in the FAST examination. FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) is a rapid diagnostic examination to assess patients with potential thoracoabdominal injuries. FAST also stands for Focused abdominal sonography for trauma. However, since FAST is not only used to assess abdominal injuries but also to assess hemopericardium in cases of pericardial injuries, the expansion Focused assessment with sonography for trauma is preferred. It can be performed within 2-4 minutes. Technique of FAST examination: With the patient in the supine position, a 3.5-5.0 MHz convex transducer is used. Four regions may be scanned: Subxiphoid transverse view - to assess for pericardial effusion and left lobe liver injuries; Longitudinal view of the right upper quadrant - to assess for right liver injuries, right kidney injury, and Morrison's pouch; Longitudinal view of the left upper quadrant - to assess for splenic injury and left kidney injury. Transverse and longitudinal views of the suprapubic region - to assess the bladder and pouch of Douglas. In an extended FAST or eFAST scan, left and right thoracic views are used to assess for pneumothorax and hemothorax.",

        "A": "B-lines indicate a normal ultrasonographic finding of the lung",

        "D": "It is unreliable for the assessment of the retroperitoneum"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "FAST is not reliable in detecting less than 100 mL of free blood. Disadvantages of FAST: it does not directly identify injury to hollow viscus, cannot reliably exclude injury in penetrating trauma, and is unreliable for the assessment of the retroperitoneum. B-lines or 'comet trails' are echogenic bright linear reflections beneath the pleura that are usually lost with any air between the probe and the lung tissue. B-lines are expected in normal aerated lung and are visualized moving along with the sliding pleura. Excessive 'B-lines', especially in the anterior lung, are abnormal and are usually indicative of interstitial edema. Therefore, the presence of B-lines along with the seashore sign indicates the absence of pneumothorax. The stratosphere sign, also known as the barcode sign, and lack of sliding movement in the lungs diagnosed by an M-mode USG is suggestive of pneumothorax.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Babinski reflex, tachycardia, and normal systolic blood pressure can be occasionally seen in patients with brain stem death. So, this should not be misinterpreted as evidence for normal brainstem function. Brain death is not characterized by decerebrate or decorticate posturing, which is a brain-originating motor response. Brainstem death is defined as the irreversible loss of cerebral and brain-stem function. Ideal criteria for brain stem death contain three essential elements: widespread cortical destruction that is reflected by deep coma and unresponsiveness to all forms of stimulation; global brainstem damage demonstrated by absent pupillary light reaction and by the loss of oculovestibular and corneal reflexes; and destruction of the medulla manifested by complete and irreversible apnea. Brainstem death entails testing twice, by two clinicians, to demonstrate the absence of: response to pain; respiratory drive (apnea despite arterial PCO2 ≥ 60 mm Hg); pupillary light reflex; corneal reflex; vestibulo-ocular reflex; and oculo-cephalic reflex. The following manifestations are occasionally seen in brain dead patients and should not be misinterpreted as evidence for brainstem function: movements originating from the spinal cord or peripheral nerve may occur; normal systolic blood pressure > 100 mmHg; sweating, flushing, tachycardia; deep tendon reflexes, superficial abdominal reflexes, triple flexion response; Babinski reflex; spontaneous movements of limbs other than pathologic flexion or extension response; and respiratory-like movements (shoulder elevation and adduction, back-arching, intercostal expansion without significant tidal volumes).",

The components of DCR include: • Permissive hypotension until definitive surgical control • Minimizing crystalloid-based resuscitation • Early use of blood products (PRBCs, FFP, platelets, cryoprecipitate) in the ratio of 1:1:1 • Use of hemostatic agents such as tranexamic acid, recombinant factor 7a, prothrombin complex concentrates.
