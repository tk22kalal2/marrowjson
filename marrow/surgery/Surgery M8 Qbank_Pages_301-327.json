They arederived from the neural crest cells of the ultimobranchial bodies.Most of the MTCs occur sporadically. However, around a quarter of the cancers are associatedwith familial MTC, MEN2A, and MEN2B.Patients with sporadic MTC present at an older age, whereas patients with familial MTC usuallypresent at a younger age. Features of MTC include:• Painful neck mass with cervical lymphadenopathy•Dysphagia, dysphonia or dyspnea if locally invaded• Diarrhoea due to increased intestinal motility by serotonin• Cushingoid habitus due to ectopic ACTH production• Metastasis is blood-borne• Microscopically, they consist of sheets of neoplastic cells separated by collagen and amyloidstromaIt is diagnosed by careful family history, physical examination, raised calcitonin, CEA levels, andfine-needle aspiration biopsy of the mass.Total thyroidectomy with central neck node dissection is the treatment of choice in MTC patients.External beam radiotherapy can be used in patients with unresectable tumors. Targeted therapycan be considered using vandetanib, sorafenib, sunitinib, and cabozantinib.Prophylactic total thyroidectomy should be considered within 5years of age in MEN2A mutationand within 1year of age in MEN2B mutation.320",

MTCcan either be sporadic (80%) or familial (RET gene mutation). In case of familial medullarythyroid carcinoma, stimulation with pentagastrin increases the release of calcitonin. This can beused for the screening of medullary thyroid carcinoma.MTC can be inherited as a part of autosomal dominant (AD) syndromes such as:• Familial MTC• MEN 2A• MEN 2BProphylactic total thyroidectomy should be considered within 5years of age in MEN2A mutationand within 1year of age in MEN2B mutation.Note: Serum calcium is measured to screen for parathyroid adenoma in MEN 2A.",

      "explanation": "Minor extrathyroidal extension detected only on histological examination is removed from thedefinition of T3 disease and therefore has no impact on either T category or overall stage.Differentiated Thyroid Cancer:• The age cutoff used for staging is increased from 45 to 55 years of age at diagnosis.• N1 disease no longer upstages a patient to stage III. If &lt; 55 years of age at diagnosis, N1disease is stage I. If° 55 years of age, N1 disease is stage II.• T3a is a new category for tumors &gt; 4 cm confined to the thyroid gland• T3b is a new category for tumors of any size demonstrating gross extrathyroidal extension intostrap muscles (sternohyoid, sternothyroid, thyrohyoid or omohyoid muscles)• Level VII lymph nodes, previously classified as lateral neck lymph nodes (N1b) is re-classified ascentral neck lymph nodes (N1a) to be more anatomically consistent and because level VIIpresented significant coding difficulties for tumor registrars, clinicians and researchers.• In differentiated thyroid cancer, the presence of distant metastases (M1) in older patients isclassified as IVB disease rather than IVC disease. Distant metastasis in anaplastic thyroid cancercontinues to be classified as IVC disease.Minimal or occult/microcarcinoma are tumors 1 cm or less in size. They have no evidence of localinvasiveness through the thyroid capsule or angioinvasion. Occult malignancies are usually notassociated with lymph node metastases. However, about 25% of patients with these tumors haveassociated occult lymph node metastases. These are nonpalpable and are found incidentally atoperative and histologic examinations or at autopsy.Anaplastic :• Unlike previous editions where all anaplastic thyroid cancers were classified as T4 disease,anaplastic cancers now use the same T definitions as differentiated thyroid cancer.• Intrathyroidal disease (T1-3a) is stage IVA•Gross extrathyroidal extension(T3b,T4) or cervical lymph node metastases (N1) is stage IVB•• Distant metastases (M1) are stage IVC323TNM staging7th AJCC (2010)8th AJCC (2018)Primary tumor(pT)TXToCannot be assessedNo evidence of cancer-do--do--do-T1T2T3T4Regional lymph nodes (pN)NXNoNiaN1bDistant metastasis (pM)Tumour ≤2 cm, intrathyroidalTia: ≤1 cm, intrathyroidalT1b:1-2 cm, intrathyroidal2-4 cm, intrathyroidal>4 cm limited to the thyroid.or any size with minimal extrathyroidal extension (muscle,soft tissue)T4a Invades subcutaneous tissue, larynx, trachea, esophagus, or RLNT4b Invades prevertebral fascia or encases carotid or mediastinal vesselsRegional lymph nodes cannotbe assessedNo lymph node metastasisPositive in level VI; unilateralor bilateral diseaseMetastasis to unilateral, bilateral or contralateral lateral neck lymph nodes (levels I, II,III, IV or V) or retropharyngeal lymph nodes-do-T3a:Tumor>4 cm limited to the thyroidT3b: Gross extrathyroidal extensioninvading onlystrap muscles(sternohyoid, sternothyroid, thyrohyoid or omohyoid muscles) from a tumour of any size-do--do--do-Metastasis to level VI or VII;unilateral or bilateral disease-do-MoM1No Distant metastasisDistant metastasis present-do--do-TNM CLASSIFICATION of Thyroid tumoursPAPILLARY OR FOLLICULAR TUMORSStageTNM AJCC 7theditionTNM AJCC 8thedition<45 y<55 yIAny T, any N, Mo-do-IIAny T, any N, M1-do-324TNM CLASSIFICATION of Thyroid tumoursIIIIIIIV A°45 yT1, No, MoT2, No, MoT3, No, MoT1-3, N1a, MoT4a, No-1a, MoT1-4a, N1b,Mo>55 yT1-2, No, MoT1-2, N1, MOT3, any N,MoT4a, any N, MoT4b, any N, MoIV BIV CT4b, any N, MoAny T, any N, M1any T, any N, M1- deleted-MEDULLARY THYROID CANCERStageTNM AJCC 7theditionTNM AJCC 8theditionIT1, No, Mo-do-IIT2-3, No, Mo-do-IIIIV AT1-3, Nia, Mo-do-T4a, any N, Mo; T1-3, N1b,-do-MoIV BT4b, any N, Mo-do-IV CAny T, any N, M1-do-ANAPLASTIC CANCERStageTNM AJCC 7theditionTNM AJCC 8theditionIV AT4a, Any N, MoT1-3a, No, MoIV BT4b, Any N, MoT1-3a,N1, Mo;T3b, Any N, M0;T4, Any N, MoIV CAny T, Any N, M1-do-",

To achieve effective uptake ofradio-iodine, TSH levels need to be greatly increased, for example, by withdrawing thyroxine afterthe surgery for 4-6 weeks.A positive whole-body iodine scan after total thyroidectomy indicates that there is either ametastatic or residual disease present. These patients are treated with I131 for radio-iodineablation.A negative scan means there is no metastasis or residual thyroid tissue. They are followed upregularly with serum thyroglobulin, TSH and USG-neck.If the tumour is resistant to radioiodine ablation, EBRT (external beam radiotherapy) is done.",
