Obstruction is characterized by colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, abdominaldistension and obstipation. Features of obstruction along with vascular compromise is seen instrangluation. Strangulation occurs in 1% to 3% of groin hernias. It is more common at theextremes of life.Most strangulated hernias are indirect inguinal hernias. However, femoral hernias have thehighest rate of strangulation (15% to 20%) of all hernias, and it is, therefore, recommended thatall femoral hernias be repaired at the time of discovery. Tenderness is the first sign ofstrangulation.The first step is the correction of hypovolemia. The treatment of choice is immediate surgery. Thefundus is opened first during surgery.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "651The given clinical scenario of a hernia medial to the inferior epigastric artery is suggestive of adirect hernia, for which Lichtenstein mesh repair is the appropriate surgical method for itsmanagement.The contents of a direct hernia protrude outward, forward, and medial to the inferior epigastricartery and the deep inguinal ring. Whereas, the contents of an indirect hernia protrude lateral tothe inferior epigastric artery. The sac of an indirect inguinal hernia passes from the deep inguinalring obliquely towards the superficial inguinal ring and then to the scrotum.A direct hernia protrudes through the Hesselbach triangle, which is a zone of weakness for directhernias.A Lichtenstein mesh repair is currently one of the most frequently used methods for treating aninguinal hernia. It is done for the reconstruction of the inguinal floor in adults. It is an anteriortension-free mesh repair that reduces the chances of recurrence of a hernia. A piece of prostheticnonabsorbable mesh is used to bridge the defect in this repair.Inguinal Hernia managementHerniotomyManagement of inguinal hernia- Dissecting out and openingthe hernial sac• Reducing the contents▪ Transfixation of the neckof the sac- Removing the remainderInguinal floor reconstruction(required in adults toprevent recurrence)ROWLaparoscopicsurgeries –TAPP, TEPAnterior tension-freerepair-bridging the defectby meshExamples -Lichtenstein repair,patch and plug repairPrimary tissue repair -strengthening posteriorwall by approximationof tissues using sutures■ No mesh is usedExamples -Bassini, Shouldice, McVay,Halsted, and Darn repairsOMARROW•Other surgical methods used for the repair of an inguinal hernia are:Bassini repair - It is done for the reconstruction of the inguinal floor in adults. In this method, amesh is not used. It is associated with a high recurrence and is not used frequently now. It is usedonly in cases of hernial strangulation and peritonitis where the use of a mesh is not preferred. It isperformed by suturing the transversus abdominis and internal oblique musculoaponeuroticarches/conjoined tendon to the inguinal ligament.•Shouldice repair - It is a multilayered repair, where the posterior wall of the inguinal canal isstrengthened by continuous sutures. It involves double-breasting of the transversalis fascia. It isassociated with a very low recurrence rate.• Gilbert repair (plug and patch repair) - It is an extension of Lichtenstein's original mesh repairand has now become the most commonly performed primary anterior inguinal hernia repair. Inthis technique, a cone-shaped plug of polypropylene mesh is used. It is deployed like anupside-down umbrella when inserted into the internal inguinal ring to occlude the hernia• McVay repair (Cooper's ligament repair) is used for the correction of direct inguinal hernia, largeindirect hernia, recurrent hernia, femoral hernias (particularly suited for strangulated femoral652hernias). In this method, the transversus abdominis aponeurosis is approximated to Cooper'sligament.• Stoppa-Rives repair - It is used for the repair of large, recurrent, or bilateral hernias. In thismethod, a sub-umbilical midline incision is given to place a large mesh into the preperitonealspace.•Herniotomy - It is used to treat inguinal hernia in a child which occurs due to the presence ofa patent processus vaginalis. Therefore in herniotomy, the repair of the inguinal ring is not done.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "With smaller defects, the mesh does not need to be sutured in Stoppa's repair.This is based on Pascal's law. Pascal's law states that any additional pressure exerted on anenclosed fluid mass is transmitted equally in all directions. The abdomen is an enclosed space andintra-abdominal pressure is distributed equally over the mesh, thereby keeping the mesh in place.Stoppa's repair is an open preperitoneal mesh repair primarily indicated for large, recurrent,bilateral hernias.In Stoppa's mesh repair, a large piece of mesh is placed in the retro muscular space, over theposterior rectus sheath or peritoneum. This mesh is not sutured in patients with small defectsbecause it is held in place by intra-abdominal pressure (Pascal's law). This allows the eventualincorporation of the mesh with the surrounding tissues. Alternatively, in larger defects, the meshcan be secured laterally with several sutures.Stoppa's preperitoneal mesh repairOMARROWPeritoneumPreperitonialspaceAbdominalwallMesh",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The most appropriate mesh used in hernioplasty is a lightweight mesh with large pores.Lightweight meshes generally contain less material and induce a less-pronounced foreign bodyreaction and decreased inflammatory response, which results in better tissue incorporation,increased prosthesis compliance, and decreased patient discomfort and pain.Meshes with large pores exhibit less inflammatory infiltrate, connective tissue, and scar bridging,which allows increased soft tissue ingrowth. They have greater elasticity and flexibility and alsoshrink less resulting in lesser adhesions, better tissue incorporation, and decreased patientdiscomfort and pain. So the best mesh type among the given options is lightweight mesh withlarge pores.Meshes used in hernioplasty can be synthetic or biological depending on their composition.Synthetic meshes are made from polypropylene, polyester, or PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene).PTFE meshes are hydrophobic with a lower risk of adhesion.Biological meshes are acellular matrix materials derived from humans or animals and have lessercomplications. But due to poor collagen deposition and absorption, they rapidly lose mechanicalstrength and hence their use is restricted to infected environments.Note: To promote better tissue integration, a composite mesh was developed which combines theattributes of polypropylene and PTFE by layering the two substances on top of one another.POLYPROPYLENEPOLYESTE PTFERmonofilammultifilame solidentnthydrophobi hydrophilic hydrophoCbicrigidelasticrigid",

      "explanation": "Loss of sensation in the root of the penis and adjacent part of the scrotum is suggestive of aninjury to the ilioinguinal nerve. It is most commonly injured within the inguinal canal in openhernia repair due to traction or thermal injury.654The iliohypogastric nerve carries the sensory supply from the suprapubic area. Injury to this nervein the right iliac fossa rarely causes sensory disturbances, as the suprapubic area has a rich nervesupply from other sources too. If the nerve is severed above the anterior superior iliac spine, it canlead to the weakened posterior wall of the inguinal canal resulting in direct inguinal hernia.Iliohypogastric nerve can also get injured following appendicectomy.Injury to the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve results in loss of sensation in the skin ofthe scrotum of males, and loss of sensation of the mons pubis and labia majora in females.Injury to the femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve causes hypoesthesia over the anteriorthigh below the inguinal ligament.Nerves injured in inguinal hernia surgeryPsoas muscleIliohypogastricnerveIlioinguinal nerveMAGenitofemoralnerveWExternal inguinalringOMARROWGenitalbranchGenitofemoralFemoralbranchnerve",

It is also called \"spontaneous lateral ventral hernia” or “hernia of thesemilunar line\".Option D: A pantaloon hernia occurs when both a direct and an indirect hernia develop on thesame side of the groin. The hernia is named pantaloon because the two hernia sacs are divided byepigastric vessels, and so they look like a pair of pants.",

It is the mostcommon hernia regardless of gender.In men, indirect hernias predominate over direct hernias at a ratio of 2:1. Femoral hernia andumbilical hernias are more common in females compared to males at ratios of 10:1 and 2:1,respectively. Although femoral hernias occur more frequently in women than in men, inguinalhernia remains the most common hernia in women.650Solution to Question 7:Pubic tubercle is used to differentiate between inguinal and femoral hernias.Inguinal hernia is above and medial to the pubic tubercle.Femoral hernia is below and lateral to the pubic tubercle.Another structure that is useful in differentiating between inguinal and femoral hernia is inguinalligament. An inguinal hernia leaves the abdominal cavity just above the inguinal ligament and afemoral hernia leaves just below the inguinal ligament.Solution to Question 8:The sac and contents of a direct hernia protrude through Hesselbach's triangle, i.e., medial to theinferior epigastric artery.Solution to Question 9:Bubonocele is a type of indirect inguinal hernia where the hernia is limited to the inguinal canal.Indirect inguinal hernia is more common on the right side because of the delay in atrophy of theprocessus vaginalis after the normal slower descent of the right testis to the scrotum during fetaldevelopment.Solution to Question 10:Strangulation is the most common serious complication of a hernia.An incarcerated hernia is a part of the intestine or abdominal tissue that becomes trapped in thesac of a hernia.An incarcerated hernia can lead to a bowel obstruction orstrangulation. Obstruction is characterized by colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, abdominaldistension and obstipation. Features of obstruction along with vascular compromise is seen instrangluation. Strangulation occurs in 1% to 3% of groin hernias. It is more common at theextremes of life.Most strangulated hernias are indirect inguinal hernias. However, femoral hernias have thehighest rate of strangulation (15% to 20%) of all hernias, and it is, therefore, recommended thatall femoral hernias be repaired at the time of discovery. Tenderness is the first sign ofstrangulation.The first step is the correction of hypovolemia. The treatment of choice is immediate surgery. Thefundus is opened first during surgery.Solution to Question 11:651The given clinical scenario of a hernia medial to the inferior epigastric artery is suggestive of adirect hernia, for which Lichtenstein mesh repair is the appropriate surgical method for itsmanagement.The contents of a direct hernia protrude outward, forward, and medial to the inferior epigastricartery and the deep inguinal ring. Whereas, the contents of an indirect hernia protrude lateral tothe inferior epigastric artery. The sac of an indirect inguinal hernia passes from the deep inguinalring obliquely towards the superficial inguinal ring and then to the scrotum.A direct hernia protrudes through the Hesselbach triangle, which is a zone of weakness for directhernias.A Lichtenstein mesh repair is currently one of the most frequently used methods for treating aninguinal hernia. It is done for the reconstruction of the inguinal floor in adults. It is an anteriortension-free mesh repair that reduces the chances of recurrence of a hernia. A piece of prostheticnonabsorbable mesh is used to bridge the defect in this repair.Inguinal Hernia managementHerniotomyManagement of inguinal hernia- Dissecting out and openingthe hernial sac• Reducing the contents▪ Transfixation of the neckof the sac- Removing the remainderInguinal floor reconstruction(required in adults toprevent recurrence)ROWLaparoscopicsurgeries –TAPP, TEPAnterior tension-freerepair-bridging the defectby meshExamples -Lichtenstein repair,patch and plug repairPrimary tissue repair -strengthening posteriorwall by approximationof tissues using sutures■ No mesh is usedExamples -Bassini, Shouldice, McVay,Halsted, and Darn repairsOMARROW•Other surgical methods used for the repair of an inguinal hernia are:Bassini repair - It is done for the reconstruction of the inguinal floor in adults. In this method, amesh is not used. It is associated with a high recurrence and is not used frequently now. It is usedonly in cases of hernial strangulation and peritonitis where the use of a mesh is not preferred. It isperformed by suturing the transversus abdominis and internal oblique musculoaponeuroticarches/conjoined tendon to the inguinal ligament.•Shouldice repair - It is a multilayered repair, where the posterior wall of the inguinal canal isstrengthened by continuous sutures. It involves double-breasting of the transversalis fascia. It isassociated with a very low recurrence rate.• Gilbert repair (plug and patch repair) - It is an extension of Lichtenstein's original mesh repairand has now become the most commonly performed primary anterior inguinal hernia repair. Inthis technique, a cone-shaped plug of polypropylene mesh is used. It is deployed like anupside-down umbrella when inserted into the internal inguinal ring to occlude the hernia• McVay repair (Cooper's ligament repair) is used for the correction of direct inguinal hernia, largeindirect hernia, recurrent hernia, femoral hernias (particularly suited for strangulated femoral652hernias). In this method, the transversus abdominis aponeurosis is approximated to Cooper'sligament.• Stoppa-Rives repair - It is used for the repair of large, recurrent, or bilateral hernias. In thismethod, a sub-umbilical midline incision is given to place a large mesh into the preperitonealspace.•Herniotomy - It is used to treat inguinal hernia in a child which occurs due to the presence ofa patent processus vaginalis. Therefore in herniotomy, the repair of the inguinal ring is not done.Solution to Question 12:With smaller defects, the mesh does not need to be sutured in Stoppa's repair.This is based on Pascal's law. Pascal's law states that any additional pressure exerted on anenclosed fluid mass is transmitted equally in all directions. The abdomen is an enclosed space andintra-abdominal pressure is distributed equally over the mesh, thereby keeping the mesh in place.Stoppa's repair is an open preperitoneal mesh repair primarily indicated for large, recurrent,bilateral hernias.In Stoppa's mesh repair, a large piece of mesh is placed in the retro muscular space, over theposterior rectus sheath or peritoneum. This mesh is not sutured in patients with small defectsbecause it is held in place by intra-abdominal pressure (Pascal's law). This allows the eventualincorporation of the mesh with the surrounding tissues. Alternatively, in larger defects, the meshcan be secured laterally with several sutures.Stoppa's preperitoneal mesh repairOMARROWPeritoneumPreperitonialspaceAbdominalwallMeshSolution to Question 13:Inguinal hernia in a child is treated by herniotomy. In this procedure, repair of the inguinal ring isnot done.653This is because the inguinal hernia in the pediatric population is due to the presence of patentprocessus vaginalis and not due to the weakening of the abdominal muscles or the ligaments.Herniotomy involves either reduction of the hernial sac alone, or opening of the hernial sac,reduction of the contents, transfixation of the neck, and excision of the patent processus vaginalis/hernial sac.Solution to Question 14:The most appropriate mesh used in hernioplasty is a lightweight mesh with large pores.Lightweight meshes generally contain less material and induce a less-pronounced foreign bodyreaction and decreased inflammatory response, which results in better tissue incorporation,increased prosthesis compliance, and decreased patient discomfort and pain.Meshes with large pores exhibit less inflammatory infiltrate, connective tissue, and scar bridging,which allows increased soft tissue ingrowth. They have greater elasticity and flexibility and alsoshrink less resulting in lesser adhesions, better tissue incorporation, and decreased patientdiscomfort and pain. So the best mesh type among the given options is lightweight mesh withlarge pores.Meshes used in hernioplasty can be synthetic or biological depending on their composition.Synthetic meshes are made from polypropylene, polyester, or PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene).PTFE meshes are hydrophobic with a lower risk of adhesion.Biological meshes are acellular matrix materials derived from humans or animals and have lessercomplications. But due to poor collagen deposition and absorption, they rapidly lose mechanicalstrength and hence their use is restricted to infected environments.Note: To promote better tissue integration, a composite mesh was developed which combines theattributes of polypropylene and PTFE by layering the two substances on top of one another.POLYPROPYLENEPOLYESTE PTFERmonofilammultifilame solidentnthydrophobi hydrophilic hydrophoCbicrigidelasticrigidSolution to Question 15:Loss of sensation in the root of the penis and adjacent part of the scrotum is suggestive of aninjury to the ilioinguinal nerve. It is most commonly injured within the inguinal canal in openhernia repair due to traction or thermal injury.654The iliohypogastric nerve carries the sensory supply from the suprapubic area. Injury to this nervein the right iliac fossa rarely causes sensory disturbances, as the suprapubic area has a rich nervesupply from other sources too. If the nerve is severed above the anterior superior iliac spine, it canlead to the weakened posterior wall of the inguinal canal resulting in direct inguinal hernia.Iliohypogastric nerve can also get injured following appendicectomy.Injury to the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve results in loss of sensation in the skin ofthe scrotum of males, and loss of sensation of the mons pubis and labia majora in females.Injury to the femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve causes hypoesthesia over the anteriorthigh below the inguinal ligament.Nerves injured in inguinal hernia surgeryPsoas muscleIliohypogastricnerveIlioinguinal nerveMAGenitofemoralnerveWExternal inguinalringOMARROWGenitalbranchGenitofemoralFemoralbranchnerveSolution to Question 16:Femoral hernia is classified under type 7 Gilbert hernia.As per Nyhus classification system, femoral hernia is classified under type 3C.Solution to Question 17:All femoral hernias should be repaired and incarcerated femoral hernias should have the herniasac contents examined for viability.Option A: Femoral hernia occurs in both males and females, but it is more common inmultiparous females. Femoral hernia is more common on the right side because ofthe tamponading effect of the sigmoid colon on the left femoral canal. This effect is absent on theright side.Option C: The incidence of strangulation in femoral hernias is high because of the narrowness ofthe neck of the sac and rigidity of the femoral ring.Option D: Femoral vein is situated lateral to a femoral hernia (femoral canal).655Solution to Question 18:The correct option is 1-B, 2-A, 3-D, 4-C.Surgery1.

        "A": "Arcuate lineSolution to Question 21:Spigelian hernia beltOMARROW657The given clinical scenario is that of a sliding hernia.Sliding hernia occurs when an internal organ composes a portion of the wall of the hernia sac.The most common viscus involved are as follows:• Left side: sigmoid colon and its mesentery•Right side: cecumIt is more common on the left side. Most sliding hernias are variants of indirect inguinal hernias.The primary danger associated with a sliding hernia is the failure to recognize the visceralcomponent of the hernia sac resulting in injury to the bowel or bladder.Option A: A lumbar hernia is a posterolateral body wall hernia where the bowel, omentum, orpre-peritoneal fat herniates through the lumbar triangles.Option C: A Spigelian hernia occurs through slit-like defects in the anterior abdominal walladjacent to the semilunar line. Most spigelian hernias occur in the lower abdomen where theposterior sheath is deficient. It is also called \"spontaneous lateral ventral hernia” or “hernia of thesemilunar line\".Option D: A pantaloon hernia occurs when both a direct and an indirect hernia develop on thesame side of the groin. The hernia is named pantaloon because the two hernia sacs are divided byepigastric vessels, and so they look like a pair of pants.Solution to Question 22:The given clinical scenario is suggestive of an iatrogenic lumbar hernia which developed due toweakening of the posterior abdominal wall due to surgery. It occurs more commonly on the leftside.A lumbar hernia is a posterolateral body wall hernia where the bowel, omentum, or pre-peritonealfat herniates through the lumbar triangles. Causes can be congenital, acquired, traumatic, oriatrogenic. It is frequently confused for lipomas, muscle strains, fibromas, abscesses, and kidneytumors.Solution to Question 23:The diagram shows Maydl's hernia/Hernia-en-W/retrograde hernia, where 2 loops of the bowelremain in the hernia sac with the connecting loop inside the abdomen.Option A: In Richter's hernia, a small portion of the antimesenteric wall of the intestine is trappedwithin the hernia. Strangulation can occur without the presence of intestinal obstruction.Clinically, it mimics gastroenteritis.Option B: In Littre's hernia, Meckel's diverticulum is the content. Amyand's hernia is an inguinalhernia in which the hernia sac contains a normal or acutely inflamed appendix.Option C: Petersen hernia is caused by the herniation of intestinal loops through the defectbetween the small bowel limbs, the transverse mesocolon, and the retroperitoneum, after any type658of gastrojejunostomy.Solution to Question 24:The likely diagnosis in this patient is epigastric hernia, also known as fatty hernia of linea alba.Epigastric hernia is located between the xiphoid process and umbilicus, usually in the midline. Itoccurs more commonly in males. A soft midline swelling can be felt more easily than seen. Painoccurs due to the incarceration of the preperitoneal fat and may simulate peptic ulcer. There is nooverlying sac.Solution to Question 25:The given clinical scenario and examination findings are suggestive of obturator hernia.Howship-Romberg sign can be seen in patients with obturator hernia.Howship-Romberg sign refers to pain in the anteromedial aspect of the thigh due to compressionof the obturator nerve that is relieved by thigh flexion.Obturator hernia is also known as skinny old lady hernia and French hernia. It occurs morecommonly in thin, elderly, debilitated females.Predisposing factors are:• Women with wider pelvis and more triangular obturator canal• Malnutrition•Chronic constipation•Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)• Multiparity• Ascites.KyphoscoliosisIntestinal obstruction can occur.Option A: Femoral hernias commonly present as a small lump in the groin. They may beasymptomatic or present with strangulation in about 30% of patients.Option C: A posterior approach, open or laparoscopic surgery is the treatment of choice. Thisapproach provides direct access to the hernia.Option D: Interparietal hernias are rare and occur when the sac lies between layers of theabdominal wall. These hernias most frequently occur in previous incisions. Spigelian hernias arealmost always interparietal.659Bowel loop enteringobturator foramenHernial sac underpectineus muscleObturatorexternusmusclePectineus muscle.Adductor longusmuscleObturator herniaOMARROWSolution to Question 26:Gibbon's hernia is a hernia with hydrocele.Option B: Berger's hernia is hernia into the pouch of Douglas.Option C: Beclard's hernia is femoral hernia through the opening of the saphenous vein.Option D: Ogilvie's hernia is hernia through a defect in conjoint tendon just lateral to where itinserts with the rectus sheath.Edward Gibbon, the author of \"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\" was greatlyembarrassed by a large hydrocele. The second time that it was tapped, it became infected, andGibbon died a few days later. The hydrocele was associated with a large scrotal hernia which hadprobably been punctured.Solution to Question 27:According to the European Hernia Society classification, M3 incisional hernia refers to umbilicalhernia.According to the European Hernia Society classification of incisional hernias:Midline incisional hernias are classified as-Lateral incisional hernias are classified as-M1Subxiphoida1M2EpigastricM3Umbilical660M1Subxiphoida1M4InfraumbilicalM5SuprapubicL1SubcostalL2FlankL3IliacL4LumbarSolution to Question 28:Paraduodenal hernia is more common on the left side (75%).Option A: In Left-sided paraduodenal hernia, bowel herniates through the fossa of Landzert.Left paraduodenal herniaFossa of LandzertMARROWOption B: In right-sided paraduodenal hernia, bowel herniates through the fossa ofWaldeyer/Kolb.661Right paraduodenal hernia*Fossa of WaldeyerOMARROWBoth the fossa of Landzert and the fossa of Waldeyer/Kolb are formed due to congenitalmesenteric fusion defects.Option C: Paraduodenal hernia is the most common internal hernia and they are usuallycongenital.Solution to Question 29:The given clinical history of congenital hypothyroidism and the image showing a mass protrudingout of the umbilicus are indicative of an umbilical hernia. Obstruction and strangulation areuncommon below the age of 3 years.Mayo's operation is done for umbilical hernia. A small curved incision is made below theumbilicus and the neck of the sac is opened. The contents are returned to the peritoneal cavityand the redundant sac is excised after closing it. Defect in the linea alba is closed with interruptedsutures. Indications for surgery in umbilical hernia are:• Defect size &gt;2cm• Persisting beyond 5 years••Progressively enlarging after 2 years of age (usually regresses spontaneously by 2 years of age)⚫ Symptomatic• StrangulatedIn adults, defects up to 2cm in diameter may be sutured primarily with minimal tension.However, with larger defects, mesh reinforcement will be beneficial.Solution to Question 30:662The congenital defect showing herniation of the intestinal contents enclosed in a sac from theumbilicus is suggestive of omphalocele. It is due to the failure of the physiological hernia toreduce into the abdominal cavity before 10 weeks resulting in non-closure of the umbilical ring.Physiological herniation of the midgut through the umbilicus occurs during the 5th week so as toaccommodate the rapidly growing intestine and persists until the 10th week.Omphalocele is seen in term babies and is usually associated with other congenital anomalies(e.g., trisomy 13, trisomy 18, or Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome) and with increased levels ofa-fetoprotein.An omphalocele may contain the stomach, liver, and intestines. These contents are enclosed in asac.The treatment is as follows:• Preservation of the intact sac with a sterile, moistened, saline gauze or transparent bowel bag.⚫ IV fluids should be started, along with gastric tube decompression and IV antibiotics.• Topical application of povidone-iodine ointment, merbromin (mercurochrome), or silvernitrate allows the sac to thicken and epithelialize gradually.• Primary surgical closure is preferred for small to medium-sized defects.GastroschisisAbdominal wall defectUmbilical cordIntestine©MARROW663OmphaloceleMembranous sacUmbilical cordAbdominal contentsOMARROWSolution to Question 31:The given clinical image is that of a congenital umbilical anomaly such as patent urachus, urachalcyst, and vitelline cyst (resulting from the persistence of omphalomesenteric duct). The next beststep is the USG abdomen to diagnose if the anomaly is cystic, fibrous or fistula and it'sconnections.Omphalomesenteric duct abnormalities: Vitello intestinal duct or omphalomesenteric duct is theconnection between the yolk sac and the midgut during embryonic life, which eventually getsobliterated. The persistence of the vitellointestinal duct leads to various abnormalities dependingon which part of the duct remains patent.••Persistence of the proximal intestinal end of the duct leads to Meckel's diverticula.• Persistence of the distal end near the umbilicus leads to the umbilical polyp or sinus.Persistence of the distal end with mucus retention leads to the cyst, which may be associatedwith the intestine or the umbilicus by a fibrous band.•A fully patent vitellointestinal duct can lead to an enterocutaneous fistula.664Anomalies of the vitello-intestinal ductVitolline or umbilical fistulaThe vitelline duct remains patent inintestinal tract to the umbilicus.BMockel's diverticulumA small section of the vitellineduot persists to form anoutpouching of the ileum.CEnterocystoceleThe vitelline duôt persists in theform of a cyst.DOmphalomesenterio ligamentThe vitelline duot transforms intoa fibrous band that connects theintestinal tract to the umbilicus.(",
