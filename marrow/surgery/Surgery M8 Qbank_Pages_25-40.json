      "explanation": "The compensatory mechanism in shock reduces the perfusion to the skin, muscle, and gastrointestinal tract and not to the kidney. As shock progresses, the body's cardiovascular and endocrine compensatory responses reduce the blood flow to non-essential organs by vasoconstriction. This occurs in order to preserve preload and flow to the kidneys, lungs, and brain.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of Beck's triad (hypotension, distended neck veins, and muffled heart sounds) is seen in cardiac tamponade. Shock due to cardiac tamponade is primarily an example of obstructive shock. Obstructive shock is characterized by a reduction in preload due to mechanical obstruction of the cardiac filling of the left and/or right sides of the heart, which in turn leads to a fall in cardiac output. Common causes of obstructive shock include: cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax, and massive pulmonary embolus or air embolus. Cardiogenic shock is due to primary failure of the heart to pump blood. It may be due to myocardial depression as a result of infarction, cardiomyopathy, or blunt myocardial injury. Patients with cardiac tamponade may eventually develop cardiogenic shock as the myocardium is stressed against the obstruction.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario of the presence of hypotension associated with the spinal cord injury is suggestive of neurogenic shock. It is associated with bradycardia and not tachycardia. Neurogenic shock refers to reduced tissue perfusion due to loss of vasomotor tone to peripheral arterial beds. Neurogenic shock is usually secondary to spinal cord injuries due to vertebral body fractures of the cervical or high thoracic region that disrupts the sympathetic regulation of peripheral vascular tone. Loss of vasoconstrictor impulses results in increased vascular capacitance, decreased venous return, and decreased cardiac output. Neurogenic shock disruption of the sympathetic nervous system results in loss of sympathetic tone, venous and arterial vasodilation, decreased venous return, decreased stroke volume, cardiac output, and impaired cellular metabolism. The classic description of neurogenic shock consists of: hypotension associated with bradycardia (absence of reflexive tachycardia due to disrupted sympathetic discharge), warm extremities (due to loss of peripheral vasoconstriction), and motor and sensory deficits indicative of a spinal cord injury, radiographic evidence of a vertebral column fracture.",

      "explanation": "• Modified shock index = HR/MAP • Original shock index = HR/SBP The shock index is a hemodynamic stability indicator. In patients with shock, it is a better predictor of mortality than blood pressure or heart rate alone. A shock index > 0.9 is indicative of higher mortality. The modified shock index is a more sensitive indicator of tissue perfusion than the original shock index. In critically ill patients, the DBP decreases earlier than SBP, hence, the modified shock index using MAP is better suited to assess the severity of shock.",

It is the condition of reduced oxygen delivery where the primary physiologic disturbance is a reduction in systemic vascular resistance. It is unique among the types of shock in that there is a compensatory increase in cardiac output. The most common cause of distributive shock is sepsis. The causes of vasodilatation in various types of distributive shock: The following table shows cardiovascular and metabolic characteristics of different types of shock. Type of distributive shock: Septic shock, Anaphylactic shock, Neurogenic shock (spinal cord injury). Cause of vasodilatation: Release of bacterial products (endotoxin) and the activation of cellular and humoral components of the immune system. Histamine release. Failure of sympathetic outflow and adequate vascular tone. Hypovolemia, Cardiogenic, Obstructive, Distributive. Cardiac output: Low, Low, Low, High (in septic and anaphylactic shock), Low (in neurogenic shock). Vascular resistance: High, High, High, Low. Hypovolemic, Cardiogenic, Obstructive, Distributive.

      "explanation": "The given clinical presentation is seen in septic shock. In distributive (septic) shock, the peripheries are warm and capillary refill will be brisk, despite the profound shock. In early stages (compensated stage) of septic shock, the patient has clammy, warm peripheries. The latter is a distinct feature from other types of shock where peripheral vasoconstriction leads to cold peripheries. The patient will have decreased vascular resistance, inadequate afterload, abnormally high cardiac output, and tachycardia. In the later stages (uncompensated phase) of septic shock, there is reduced venous return, preload, and reduced cardiac output with low blood pressure.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of septic shock. Crystalloids are the initial fluid of choice in the resuscitation of severe sepsis and septic shock. Septic shock is also known as vasodilatory shock (but remember vasopressors are not the first line). Management protocol for septic shock: Step 1: Immediate evaluation - securing the airway (if indicated) and correcting hypoxemia and establishing venous access for the early administration of fluids and antibiotics are priorities in the management of patients with sepsis and septic shock. Step 2: Initial resuscitative therapy - aggressive administration of intravenous fluids (IVF), usually crystalloids, are given at 30 mL/kg (actual body weight) within the first three hours following the presentation. Empirical antibiotic therapy started within the first hour. Step 3: Intravenous vasopressors are useful in patients who remain hypotensive despite adequate fluid resuscitation or who develop cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Vasopressor agents such as phenylephrine, noradrenaline are indicated in distributive shock states, which include septic shock, neurogenic shock, etc., where there is peripheral vasodilatation, and a low systemic vascular resistance, leading to hypotension. But they are not the first-line treatment.",

They are given to the patients with thrombocytopenia or with platelet dysfunction who are bleeding or undergoing surgery. Packed cells (PRBCs) are stored in a SAG-M solution (saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol) and have a shelf life of 42 days at 2–6 °C. (Older storage regimens included storage in CPD - citrate-phosphate-dextrose solutions which have a shelf life of 2-3 weeks.)

Perioperative anemia: To ensure adequate oxygen delivery during the perioperative phase. Symptomatic chronic anemia: without hemorrhage or impending surgery.

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). The presence of antibodies against the Human Leukocyte antigen (Anti-HLA Ab) in the donor blood is implicated in the development of TRALI. TRALI is defined as an acute lung injury that is temporally related to blood transfusion and causes non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. It occurs within the first six hours following a transfusion. Screening for HLA antibodies has been introduced to prevent TRALI. TRALI usually results from the transfusion of donor plasma that contains high-titer anti-HLA class II antibodies that bind to recipient leukocytes. The leukocytes aggregate in the pulmonary vasculature and release mediators that increase capillary permeability. Testing the donor's plasma for anti-HLA antibodies can support this diagnosis. The implicated donors are frequently multiparous women. The transfusion of plasma from male and nulliparous women donors reduces the risk of TRALI.",

PCCs are highly purified concentrates prepared from pooled plasma. They contain factors II, IX, and X. Factor VII may be included or produced separately. Fresh frozen plasma and platelets are used in the management of coagulopathy. Fresh frozen plasma is used if prothrombin time (PT) or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) > 1.5 times normal. Platelets are transfused if the platelet count < 50 x 10^3/ul.

The presence of 2 or more qSOFA points is a simple promptto identify infected patients outside the ICU who are likely to develop sepsis.The primary method to evaluate the risk of organ dysfunction (sepsis) in patients with suspectedinfection is by determining the Sequential (sepsis-related) organ failure assessment (SOFA) score;which includes assessment of:• Circulation Systolic BP &amp; need for vasopressors; platelet count•-Respiration - PaO2/FiO2 &amp; need for mechanical ventilation• Mentation - Glasgow Coma Score•• Hepatic function - Bilirubin• Renal function - CreatinineOrgan dysfunction is identified by a SOFA score of ° 2The SOFA score is limited by its requirement of multiple laboratory tests which makes it complexand time-consuming.
