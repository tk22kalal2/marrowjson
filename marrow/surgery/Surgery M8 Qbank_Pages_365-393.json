This degeneration results in the failure of relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter(LES) on swallowing.The patients present with a classic triad of dysphagia, regurgitation, and weight loss. Thedysphagia initially begins with liquid foods and then progresses to solid foods. As the food getsaccumulated in the esophagus, patients may complain of halitosis. With further progression of thedisease, the patients may develop pneumonia, lung abscess, etc.The initial diagnosis is made by barium swallow or endoscopy, which shows the presence ofdilated esophagus due to the constriction of the lower esophageal sphincter (bird-beakappearance).

Failure of relaxation of theLES causes an elevated median integrated relaxation pressure and a complete failure ofperistalsis.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The patient likely has achalasia cardia and the definitive treatment is Heller's myotomy. Surgicalmanagement is the first-line treatment modality.Achalasia or 'failure to relax' in Greek occurs due to the lack of ganglion cells in the myentericplexus (Auerbach's). The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) fails to relax leading to dysphagia,regurgitation of food, and progressive dilation of the esophagus proximal to the constriction.Barium radiology shows hold-up in the distal esophagus, abnormal contractions in theoesophageal body, and a tapering stricture in the distal esophagus often described as a ‘bird'sbeak'.Laparoscopic Heller's myotomy is the procedure of choice. Here, the muscles of the loweresophagus and cardia are cut. However, this can cause iatrogenic gastroesophageal reflux (GERD)due to damage to the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Thus, newer techniques involve a partialfundoplication like Dor's procedure to reinforce the sphincter and reduce GERD symptoms.Endoscopic myotomy is a newer, alternate procedure. Here, a submucosal tunnel is formed in themid esophagus region that allows a long myotomy.380EsophagealdilationHeller's myotomyLoweresophagealsphincterBMAMyotomyincisionStomachPouting mucosathrough myotomyOMARROWOption A: Calcium channel blockers can be given in the initial stages of the disease. They relievethe chest pressure that occurs around mealtimes. However, they are not permanent treatmentsand can be used while waiting for surgery.Option B: Botulinum toxin injection can be used as a treatment in patients who may not becandidates for surgery or dilatation. Limitations to botulinum toxin injections are that the effect isshort-lived (6-12 months) and patients often require multiple treatments.Option C: Pneumatic dilatation of the LES has is successful in 75% of patients. It involves using aballoon to stretch the LES and improve competence. It requires multiple sessions and has a lowrisk of esophageal perforation.",

      "explanation": "The above clinical scenario with episodes triggered by cold foods and manometric findings aresuggestive of a diffuse esophageal spasm (DES).Diffuse esophageal spasm is a hypermotility disorder of the esophagus. It is caused byspontaneous, abnormal contractions seen more in the distal two-thirds of the esophageal body. Itis more common in women.Patients usually present with dysphagia and chest pain. Pathologically, there is markedhypertrophy of the circular muscles. It is often triggered by cold foods. It mimics symptoms ofmyocardial infarction and also shows improvement when sublingual nitroglycerin is administered.It causes smooth muscle relaxation of the esophagus.A barium swallow shows a corkscrew esophagus. However, manometry (high-resolutionmanometry is preferred) is the gold standard test for diagnosis. In classic manometry, if there aresimultaneous, multi-peaked contractions of high amplitude (&gt;120 mmHg) or long duration(&gt;2.5 seconds) it is suggestive of diffuse esophageal spasm.382On high-resolution manometry, a DCI (distal contractile integral) &gt;450 mmHg is suggestive ofDES. The distal contractile integral (DCI) is an index of contractile vigor in high-resolutionmanometry, calculated as the product of amplitude, duration, and span of the distal esophagealcontraction.Hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter - It is achalasia in evolution. Shows increased LESpressure but normal peristalsis.Nutcracker's esophagus - It is the most common motility disorder of the esophagus. Inconventional manometry, it shows a high-amplitude peristaltic contraction ( &gt;180mmHg) and alonger duration of contraction (&gt;7sec).In high-resolution manometry, a DCI &gt; 8000mmHg is suggestive of nutcracker's esophagus.",

      "question": "Detailed ExplanationsType C is the commonest variety of tracheo-esophageal fistula (TEF).A tracheoesophageal fistula is an abnormal communication between the esophagus and trachea.Type C lesion is associated with proximal esophageal atresia and distal TEF. The proximal blindpouch ends approximately at the distance of one or two vertebral bodies from the distal TEF.Tracheoesophageal fistula is associated with VACTERL (vertebral, anorectal, cardiac, tracheal,esophageal, renal, and limb) anomalies.Drooling of saliva, inability to pass a nasogastric tube and history of polyhydramnios suggest adiagnosis of oesophagal atresia with or without TEF. This can be confirmed with a chest X-rayimage showing a coiled nasogastric tube in the oesophagal pouch as shown in the image below.Solution to Question 2:377The above scenario along with the radiograph is suggestive of a type-E or H-typetracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). The management for this case would be Cameron Haight'ssurgery.Management of TEF is based on Waterson's criteria:Diagnosis of TEF:Confirmatory Contrast study (Iohexol)Investigation of choice for H-type - Combined tracheo-esophagoscopyDefinitive surgery for:• Types B, C, D, and E - Cameron Haight surgery•Type A - Anastomosis with/without gastrostomyWeight/ComorbiditiesCategoryABirth weight > 2.5kgBCBirth weight 1.8-2.5kg or pneumonia or congenital anomalyBirth weight < 1.8kg or severe pneumonia or congenital anomalyManagementDefinitive surgeryNeeds stabilization before surgeryAntibiotics + Build up nutritionStaged repairAntibiotics + gastrostomySolution to Question 3:The image shows a markedly dilated esophagus and characteristic bird's beak appearance (distalnarrowing), which is suggestive of achalasia cardia.Achalasia cardia is caused due to the degeneration of the neurons in the myenteric plexus of theesophagus. This degeneration results in the failure of relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter(LES) on swallowing.The patients present with a classic triad of dysphagia, regurgitation, and weight loss. Thedysphagia initially begins with liquid foods and then progresses to solid foods. As the food getsaccumulated in the esophagus, patients may complain of halitosis. With further progression of thedisease, the patients may develop pneumonia, lung abscess, etc.The initial diagnosis is made by barium swallow or endoscopy, which shows the presence ofdilated esophagus due to the constriction of the lower esophageal sphincter (bird-beakappearance). The gold standard test to confirm achalasia cardia is esophageal manometry.Solution to Question 4:Achalasia cardia does not show normal peristalsis.378Manometric features of achalasia cardia are as follows:• Incomplete lower esophageal sphincter relaxation•Aperistalsis of the esophageal body• Elevated LES pressureDiffuse esophageal spasm is characterized by simultaneous multi-peaked contractions of theesophagus. The contractions are spontaneous and may be of abnormally high amplitude (&gt;120mmHg) or long duration. Intermittent normal peristalsis is seen.Nutcracker esophagus is characterized by high amplitude (° 180 mmHg) contractions with anincreased mean duration. The peristaltic sequence is normal.Hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter is characterized by elevated LES pressure (° 26 mmHg).Normal peristalsis is seen in the body of the esophagus.Solution to Question 5:There is increased esophageal baseline pressure in achalasia cardia.Manometric features of achalasia cardia are as follows:•Incomplete lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation•Absent peristalsis of the esophageal body• Elevated LES pressure• Increased intraesophageal baseline pressures relative to the gastric baseline pressureHigh-resolution manometry (HRM) is a gastrointestinal motility diagnostic system that measuresintraluminal pressure activity in the gastrointestinal tract using a series of closely spaced pressuresensors. For a manometry system to be classified as high-resolution instead of classic, thepressure sensors must be spaced at most 1 cm apart.Solution to Question 6:Type III achalasia in Chicago classification is also known as spastic achalasia. Achalasia cardia is amotility disorder of the esophagus in which the LES (lower esophageal sphincter) fails to relaxdue to loss of ganglion in the myenteric plexus.Chicago classification of esophageal motility divides achalasia cardia into 3 types. Thisclassification is based on the readings obtained by high-resolution manometry (HRM).Type I achalasia cardia does not show pressurization pattern.Treatment options:• Pneumatic dilatation•· Laparoscopic myotomy•·POEM (per-oral endoscopic myotomy)379The definitive treatment for Achalasia is surgical myotomy (Hellers myotomy) + fundoplication.Solution to Question 7:The given features are suggestive of type III achalasia cardia.Type III achalasia cardia is characterised by massive, simultaneous, high-pressure contractions ofthe distal esophagus.Achalasia cardia occurs due to the loss of inhibitory ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus of GIT.During swallowing, the food bolus normally triggers a primary peristaltic wave, which isresponsible for carrying the bolus to the stomach, accompanied by the relaxation of the loweresophageal sphincter (LES) to allow esophageal emptying into the stomach.Achalasia is characterized by a disruption of this normal process. Failure of relaxation of theLES causes an elevated median integrated relaxation pressure and a complete failure ofperistalsis. The esophagus becomes progressively more tortuous, leading to a megaesophagus.Solution to Question 8:The patient likely has achalasia cardia and the definitive treatment is Heller's myotomy. Surgicalmanagement is the first-line treatment modality.Achalasia or 'failure to relax' in Greek occurs due to the lack of ganglion cells in the myentericplexus (Auerbach's). The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) fails to relax leading to dysphagia,regurgitation of food, and progressive dilation of the esophagus proximal to the constriction.Barium radiology shows hold-up in the distal esophagus, abnormal contractions in theoesophageal body, and a tapering stricture in the distal esophagus often described as a ‘bird'sbeak'.Laparoscopic Heller's myotomy is the procedure of choice. Here, the muscles of the loweresophagus and cardia are cut. However, this can cause iatrogenic gastroesophageal reflux (GERD)due to damage to the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Thus, newer techniques involve a partialfundoplication like Dor's procedure to reinforce the sphincter and reduce GERD symptoms.Endoscopic myotomy is a newer, alternate procedure. Here, a submucosal tunnel is formed in themid esophagus region that allows a long myotomy.380EsophagealdilationHeller's myotomyLoweresophagealsphincterBMAMyotomyincisionStomachPouting mucosathrough myotomyOMARROWOption A: Calcium channel blockers can be given in the initial stages of the disease. They relievethe chest pressure that occurs around mealtimes. However, they are not permanent treatmentsand can be used while waiting for surgery.Option B: Botulinum toxin injection can be used as a treatment in patients who may not becandidates for surgery or dilatation. Limitations to botulinum toxin injections are that the effect isshort-lived (6-12 months) and patients often require multiple treatments.Option C: Pneumatic dilatation of the LES has is successful in 75% of patients. It involves using aballoon to stretch the LES and improve competence. It requires multiple sessions and has a lowrisk of esophageal perforation.Solution to Question 9:The most common type of carcinoma associated with this condition is squamous cell carcinoma.Achalasia is a premalignant condition. It becomes malignant due to long-standing, retained,undigested fermenting food in the body of the esophagus, causing mucosal irritation.Adenocarcinoma may also arise in the setting of achalasia but is less common as compared toSCC.Small cell carcinoma is a rare type of neuroendocrine esophageal carcinoma more common in thelower esophagus. It is very aggressive and the 5-year survival rate is 8%.Carcinoid tumors are slow-growing tumors of neuroendocrine cells that form in the GI tract,mainly in the rectum, small intestine, or appendix.Solution to Question 10:Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is used in achalasia cardia.381Treatment options:• Pneumatic dilatation• Laparoscopic myotomy• POEM (per-oral endoscopic myotomy)With the use of an operating endoscope, the mucosa of the esophagus is divided around the midto the distal third, and a submucosal tunnel is created.Through this tunnel, the muscular layer of the distal esophagus, lower esophageal sphincter(LES), and cardia are visualized and divided, effectively performing an endoscopic myotomy.The major downside of POEM is that an effective anti-reflux valve cannot be created, exposing thepatient to a 40%-50% risk of post-procedural gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).ARROWMARROWSolution to Question 11:The above clinical scenario with episodes triggered by cold foods and manometric findings aresuggestive of a diffuse esophageal spasm (DES).Diffuse esophageal spasm is a hypermotility disorder of the esophagus. It is caused byspontaneous, abnormal contractions seen more in the distal two-thirds of the esophageal body. Itis more common in women.Patients usually present with dysphagia and chest pain. Pathologically, there is markedhypertrophy of the circular muscles. It is often triggered by cold foods. It mimics symptoms ofmyocardial infarction and also shows improvement when sublingual nitroglycerin is administered.It causes smooth muscle relaxation of the esophagus.A barium swallow shows a corkscrew esophagus. However, manometry (high-resolutionmanometry is preferred) is the gold standard test for diagnosis. In classic manometry, if there aresimultaneous, multi-peaked contractions of high amplitude (&gt;120 mmHg) or long duration(&gt;2.5 seconds) it is suggestive of diffuse esophageal spasm.382On high-resolution manometry, a DCI (distal contractile integral) &gt;450 mmHg is suggestive ofDES. The distal contractile integral (DCI) is an index of contractile vigor in high-resolutionmanometry, calculated as the product of amplitude, duration, and span of the distal esophagealcontraction.Hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter - It is achalasia in evolution. Shows increased LESpressure but normal peristalsis.Nutcracker's esophagus - It is the most common motility disorder of the esophagus. Inconventional manometry, it shows a high-amplitude peristaltic contraction ( &gt;180mmHg) and alonger duration of contraction (&gt;7sec).In high-resolution manometry, a DCI &gt; 8000mmHg is suggestive of nutcracker's esophagus.Solution to Question 12:The given image is suggestive of diffuse esophageal spasm (DES). Myotomy involves the entirelength of the affected segment along with a margin of several centimeters to the spastic region toprevent remnants of spasticity.First-line therapy is with calcium channel blockers and nitrates. Endoscopic botulinum toxininjection and pneumatic dilation are second-line therapies. Calcium-channel antagonists,vasodilators, and endoscopic dilatation have only transient effects.Botulinum toxin injection is also considered an effective and low-risk procedure but forshort-term symptom relief. Pneumatic dilation is targeted at the exact anatomic site of narrowing.Surgical treatment includes extended myotomy of the esophageal body or peroral endoscopicmyotomy. Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a safe and effective treatment for patients,especially those who are refractory to medical therapy.Solution to Question 13:The above clinical scenario with microcytic hypochromic anemia and characteristic esophagogramis suggestive of Plummer-Vinson syndrome.Plummer-Vinson syndrome/Paterson-Kelly syndrome has a triad of:• Post-cricoid webs• Dysphagia•• Iron-deficiency anemiaThe webs are made up of fibrovascular stroma and esophageal epithelium. Glossitis, angularstomatitis, koilonychia are also associated with this condition.Laboratory investigations reveal microcytic-hypochromic blood picture and bariumesophagography or esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) will help detect post-cricoid webs.Treatment includes correcting the iron-deficiency anemia which may improve dysphagia and pain.Esophageal bougies can be used during upper endoscopy to dilate the post-cricoid webs and allow383normal swallowing and passage of food.Complications include the risk of perforation during dilatation and also malignant transformationinto squamous cell carcinoma.The image below shows endoscopic appearance of post-cricoid web.Solution to Question 14:The above clinical scenario is suggestive of Schatzki's ring.The barium swallow shows a thin circumferential ring in the distal esophagus, which is suggestiveof Schatzki's ring.NO USAR PARA DIAGNOSTICO MEIH: 0 %F: 30%Schatzki's ring is a benign condition wherein there is a concentric, fibrous thickening andnarrowing of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), with squamous epithelium above and384columnar cells below.Schatzki's ring is made up of mucosal and submucosal layers. It causes dysphagia and isassociated with gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD). It is most commonly seen in the lowerthird of the esophagus.Treatment is endoscopic dilation with antireflux therapy and repeated dilation is often necessary.Persistent strictures should always raise suspicion for malignant disease.The image below shows endoscopic appearance of the Schatzki's ring.GROVERSolution to Question 15:The above image shows the origin of the aberrant right subclavian artery (red arrow) causingextrinsic compression of the esophagus that is suggestive of dysphagia lusoria.In dysphagia lusoria, the right subclavian artery arises as the fourth branch of the aortic archinstead of branching from the brachiocephalic artery. It then courses behind the esophagus tosupply blood to the right arm. This causes pressure on the esophagus and results in dysphagia.It is diagnosed by CT angiography. A barium swallow shows fixed narrowing of the esophagus atthe level of the aortic arch without mucosal abnormality.Treatment is surgical repair either by reconstruction or ligation of the aberrant right subclavianartery.385Aberrant right subclavian arteryAberrant rightsubclavian artery(arteria lusori",

This space is known as Killian's triangle, which is a weak area between two partsof the inferior constrictor in the posterior pharyngeal wall.It is a pulsion diverticulum, formed due to increased intraluminal pressure forcing mucosa andsubmucosa to herniate.A small Zenker's diverticulum &lt; 2cm is managed by diverticulectomy and cricopharyngealmyotomy.Large diverticulum &gt; 2-5cm is treated by endoscopic diverticulopexy (Dohlman's procedure) orby a diverticulectomy with cricopharyngeal myotomy.Solution to Question 17:Mid esophageal diverticula is a true diverticula. It involves all three layers of the esophageal wallsuch as mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis.Esophageal diverticula are herniations of the esophagus that extend into neighbouring structures.They occur as a result of primary motor disturbance or abnormality of the esophageal sphincters.They are classified based on their location into:•Zenker's diverticulum (hypopharyngeal)• Mid esophageal (parabronchial)•Epiphrenic (supradiaphragmatic)386Epiphrenic and Zenker's diverticula are false diverticula involving herniation of only the mucosaand submucosa through the muscular layer of the esophagus.Midesophageal diverticula may be caused by traction on the esophagus from adjacentinflammation and fibrosis (classically tuberculosis). They are most common on the right side dueto an overabundance of structures in the left mid-thoracic region.Zenker's diverticulum:Epiphrenic diverticula as 1 and 2:ASolution to Question 18:The above clinical scenario and imaging findings are suggestive of eosinophilic esophagitis.387Eosinophilic esophagitis is an idiopathic condition commonly affecting the proximal one-third ofthe esophagus. There is migration of eosinophils to the esophagus and they contribute toextensive tissue damage and inflammation.Clinical features include swallowing difficulty, food impaction, vomiting, and heartburn.Barium swallow shows the presence of a series of rings in the esophagus which is suggestive ofeosinophilic esophagitis. These rings appear as stripes on the cat and is also known as the felineesophagus.Feline esophagus:The definitive diagnosis requires biopsy with a histologic finding of &gt;15-20 eosinophils perhigh-power field.Treatment includes oral corticosteroids and immunotherapy.Solution to Question 19:Prophylactic antibiotics have not been shown to improve the clinical outcome of acute corrosiveesophagitis and are not recommended.Corrosive esophagitis is caused due to the ingestion of alkali or acid and can be accidental or fromattempted suicide.The injury caused by alkali ingestion is deeper due to the process of saponification of fats anddehydration. The injury caused by acids is more superficial because they cause coagulativenecrosis with eschar formation, which prevents the deeper penetration of the acid.The acids also cause severe pylorospasm and therefore more gastric damage compared to alkalidue to the accumulation of the contents in the antrum.Severe corrosive injury may lead to esophageal perforation, bleeding, stricture, and death. It is arisk factor for esophageal carcinoma. Therefore, early endoscopic evaluation is recommended toassess mucosal injuries even if there is no signs of oral injury.388Management of corrosive esophagitis:•Hemodynamic stabilization and management of patient's airway• Endoscopic evaluation of injuries•Surgical management includes laparotomy and• Esophageal stenting and jejunostomy for limited hemorrhage and superficial ulceration• Esophagogastric resection and jejunostomy for extensive necrosis.Solution to Question 20:The most common site for pill-induced esophagitis is in the mid esophagus near the crossing ofaorta or carina. These structures externally compress the esophagus and prevent the movement ofthe pills.Pill-induced esophagitis is caused when the pill lodges within the lumen of the esophagus. Thispill causes direct damage to the mucosa. The risk factors for pill-induced esophagitis include poorpill-taking habits, consuming inadequate liquids, and lying down immediately after consumingthe pill.Drugs causing esophagitis are:• Doxycycline• Quinidine•⚫ Phenytoin• NSAIDS•• BisphosphonatesSolution to Question 21:The image showing serpiginous ulcers in the otherwise normal mucosa of the distal esophagus issuggestive of cytomegaloviral esophagitis.389Solution to Question 22:The clinical scenario points to a diagnosis of spontaneous perforation of the esophagus.In a perforated peptic ulcer, patients develop sudden onset severe generalized abdominal pain,tenderness, and board-like rigidity and an erect plain chest X-ray shows gas under the diaphragm(Option",
        "B": ". The foreign body in the esophagus can be asymptomatic or may present withperforation after ingestion. The radiopaque foreign body can be seen with a chest X-ray (Option",
        "C": ". Rupture of emphysematous bullae of the lung will lead to secondary pneumothorax, whichmanifests as chest pain and dyspnoea. A plain chest X-ray shows air in the thorax, and themediastinum is pushed to the opposite side (Option",
        "D": ".Spontaneous perforation of the esophagus needs immediate diagnosis and intervention due to thehigher mortality associated with it. The most common site of perforation is the lower esophagustowards the left esophageal cavity.Causes:•Iatrogenic perforation (most common)•• Boerhaave's syndrome (spontaneous emetogenic perforation)•Sharp foreign body• Corrosive ingestion• Esophageal carcinomaIt usually manifests as severe pain in the chest or abdomen after a meal or after a bout ofdrinking, commonly associated with dyspnoea. On clinical examination, there is rigidity andtenderness in the upper abdomen. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by a chest radiograph whichshows pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum, and pneumothorax. Subcutaneous emphysemacan be seen in Boerhaave's syndrome. Patients with sepsis will have a fever, tachycardia andtachypnea.390Treatment includes adequate drainage, antibiotics, closure of the perforation site if possible andsupportive measures.Solution to"
