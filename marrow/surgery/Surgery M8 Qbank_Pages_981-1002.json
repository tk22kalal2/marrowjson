It commonly progresses into seminomas.In patients with a nonpalpable testicle, diagnostic laparoscopy is performed. If testis is still notvisualised, the spermatic cord or testicular artery is traced at the deep inguinal ring to locate it.If a blind ending spermatic cord is found instead, vanishing testis syndrome (or testicularregression syndrome) is suspected. It is the partial or total absence of testicular tissue often due toan ischemic event in foetal life.991The testis once found can be delivered into the scrotum, and an orchidopexy is performed.Management of Undescended testisUnilateralnonpalpableLaparoscopyBilateralnonpalpableBlind-endingvesselsVessels exitinginternal ringIntra-abdominaltestisNoresponseMonorchiaInguinalexplorationhCGIncreasedtestosterone(and increasedFSH, LH)Anorchia± exciseremnantLaparoscopyexplorationOrchiopexyOrchiectomyFowler-Stephensorchiopexy(laparoscopic or open)MARROW",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In the first stage of a two-stage Stephens-Fowler approach, the testicular vessels are clipped.Clipping of the testicular artery promotes neo vasculogenesis along the vas deferens. It does notresult in ischemia of the testis due to the presence of collaterals from the cremasteric artery andthe artery to the ductus deferens (deferential artery).Several months later, after collaterals are established, the second stage is performed during whichthe testis and its new blood supply is mobilized into the scrotum.Stephen-Fowler's approach is done when an intra abdominal testes is located too far to reach thescrotum. Alternatively, Silbar's orchiopexy may be done. In this procedure, microvascularanastomosis of the testicular vessels with internal illiac vessels is done after the testis is mobilisedto the scrotum.",

      "explanation": "High investment of the tunica vaginalis is the most common cause of torsion of testis. It causesthe testes to hang within the tunica like a clapper in a bell.

The image below shows the bell-clapper deformity of thetestes:992MVasdeferensMBell Clapper testesNormal lieBell Clapper testesOMARROWSpermaticcordEpididymisTestisTunicavaginalisTunicaVaginalisOther abnormalities that cause torsion of the testes:• Inversion of the testis: The testis is rotated so that it lies transversely or upside down.Pedicle between epididymis and body of testis: Separation of the epididymis from the body of thetestis by a pedicle allows torsion of the testis on the pedicle that connects the testis with theepididymis.An appendix testis is a small vestigial appendage located on the upper pole of the testis. Twistingof the appendage causes testicular appendix torsion. In it, a classic blue dot sign is seen on theupper pole of the testis. It is seen as a hard tender nodule with a blue discoloration on thesuperior aspect of the testis.

In cases of high clinical suspicion, thenext best step is to explore surgically.Clinical features of testicular torsion are painful scrotal swelling, erythema, nausea, and vomiting,testis seems high in the scrotum and the twisted cord can sometimes be palpated.Signs seen on torsion of the testis are:• Deming's sign: Spasm of the cremaster muscle due to twisting of the spermatic cord causes theaffected testis to be positioned higher than the normal testis.• Angell's sign: The testis on the normal side lies horizontally because of the mesorchium betweenthe testis and epididymis.•Cremastic reflex: Absent on the side of the affected testisDoppler ultrasound scanning can confirm the absence of the blood supply to the affected testis,but the false positives are high and hence it is not routinely recommended.Manual detorsion of the testes is usually difficult because of acute pain during manipulation.Nonoperative manual detorsion is not a substitute for surgical exploration.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "In a case of suspected testicular torsion, immediate exploration needs to be done on both thesymptomatic as well as the asymptomatic side. After the de-torsion, the adequacy of the bloodflow has to be assessed by Doppler.In testicular torsion, the blood supply to the testicle is compromised due to the twisting of thespermatic cord within the tunica vaginalis, resulting in ischemia of the epididymis and the testis.The patient usually presents with acute onset pain and swelling of the scrotum. On examination,the cremasteric reflex is lost, and the scrotum looks asymmetrical.Prehn's sign is used to differentiate epididymitis from testicular torsion. Prehn's sign is said to bepositive when the pain gets relieved on lifting the testis, and it is seen in epididymo-orchitis.At the time of surgical exploration, contralateral testes also must be explored and fixed to thedartos fascia in order to prevent possible torsion occurring in this testes.More than 80% of the testis can be salvaged if surgery is performed within 6 hours. If the testis isfound to be necrosed on scrotal exploration, orchidectomy of the necrosed testis and orchidopexyof the contralateral testis is done.",

The next best step is confirmationwith polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Beading of the vas deferens is due to subepithelial tubercle formation and is specific to genitaltuberculosis.A scrotal USG will reveal an enlarged epididymis but does not have diagnostic value. Chest,kidney, and upper urinary tract imaging may reveal a primary focus.Tuberculous epididymo-orchitis is usually secondary and resolves once the primary focus istreated. Hence, a course of anti-tubercular therapy must be completed even if there is no evidenceof disease elsewhere.If resolution does not occur within two months, epididymectomy or orchidectomy is advisable.",

      "explanation": "The first sites of metastasis in left-sided testicular tumors are the para-aortic lymph nodes.Testicular tumors metastasize first to the retroperitoneal nodes. Right-sided tumors metastasizeprimarily to the interaortocaval nodes. Left-sided tumors metastasize primarily to the leftpara-aortic nodes.1000Deep inguinal lymph nodes receive drainage from the perineum and lower extremity. Inguinallymph nodes may be involved if the testicular tumor spreads to the skin of the scrotum.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario is suggestive of a non-seminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT) of thetestis. Orchidectomy via a scrotal approach is not done due to fear of seeding the tumor in thescrotal skin. Instead, an inguinal approach is used.Raised AFP levels point towards the diagnosis of non-seminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT) ofthe testis.Ultrasound of the testis should be done in all suspected cases of testicular tumor. Tumormarkers (AFP, hCG, LDH) are measured for the staging of cancer. CT of the chest, abdomen, andpelvis is done to detect metastasis.Management of testicular tumorsStageStage ITumor confined to testisStage IINodal disease confined to nodes below the diaphragmStage IIINodal disease present above the diaphragmStage IVMetastasisNon-seminomatousOrchidectomy and chemotherapyOrchidectomy and chemotherapy Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for residual diseaseOrchidectomy, radiotherapy,and chemotherapyIf residuallymph node disease is present, retroperitoneal lymph nodedissection is doneOrchidectomy and chemotheSeminomatousOrchidectomy and Active SurveillanceIf poor prognostic features* are seen, chemotherapy with a single agent, cisplatin for 1-2 cyclesOrchidectomy andradiotherapyIf residual lymph node disease is present, chemotherapyIn testicular tumors, the BEPregimen is followed withbleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin.*Poor prognostic factors following orchidectomy are:No decrease or change in tumor marker values or tumor sizePoorfollow up",
