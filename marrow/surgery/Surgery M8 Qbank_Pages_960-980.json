It is considered when a stricture is due totrauma or recurred following endoscopic treatment.• Urethral dilation - The urethra is stretched using urethral dilators. This is a blind procedure andit can cause injury. Hence, it is not done frequently.• Intermittent self-dilatation - In patients with recurrent strictures who are unable to undergourethroplasty, then intermittent self-dilatation with soft hydrophilic catheters is done on a dailybasis.",

It is seen due to dilatation of the bladder and the proximal urethra.The posterior urethral valves are membranes that have a small posterior slit, which lies just distalto the verumontanum. They function as flap valves and are obstructive to antegrade urinary flow.The posterior urethral valve is the most common congenital cause of bladder outlet obstruction inmales. PUV is classified into three types based on Young's classification.Diagnosis is made antenatally with ultrasound, which demonstrates bilateral hydronephrosisabove a distended bladder. If the diagnosis is not made antenatally, then neonates typicallypresent with urinary infection or uremia and renal failure.The investigation of choice for a posterior urethral valve is micturating cystourethrography(MCUG).Initially, the obstruction is relieved by catheterization to preserve renal function. Definitivetreatment is by urethroscopic destruction of the valves with lifelong supportive treatment.The following VCUG shows vesicoureteric reflux due to posterior urethral valves:970Posterior urethralvalve",

Nesbitt's procedure is the most common procedure done for this condition.Peyronie's disease is caused due to injury to tunica albuginea resulting in microhemorrhages. Thisleads to excess collagen deposition, calcification, and penile plaques. Hence, the penisbends towards the side of the plaque. This causes difficulty during sexual intercourse.

      "explanation": "In penile carcinoma, total amputation of the penis is done if the stump is &lt; 2cm.The investigation of choice for penile carcinoma is a biopsy from the primary tumor. For staging,MRI is the investigation of choice.The first lymph node to be involved is the superficial inguinal lymph node and thus, the sentinellymph node biopsy (SLNB) is helpful for evaluating the spread of penile cancer.The management is divided into treatment of the primary tumour and the treatment of the lymphnodes.The main principles of penile cancer surgery are to remove a 1cm margin of normal tissue andhave at least a 2cm stump after surgery.Surgery is the mainstay treatment of penile cancer. Chemotherapy regime includes 5-fluorouraciland cisplatin. Radiotherapy can be done for inguinal lymph nodes if lymph node dissection is notdone.979Management of carcinoma penisAssess the primary tumorIf stump > 2omPartial amputationof penisAfter leaving a 1cm marginRRIf stump2omTotal amputationof the penis andperineal urethroplastyManagement of the primary tumorNon-enlargedlymph nodesSentinel lymph nodebiopsy (SLNB)Asses the lymph nodeRREnlargedlymph nodesPerform FNACIf positive.If negativeIf positiveIf negativeIlio-inguinaldissectionlymph nodeIlio-inguinalObserveslymph nodedissectionManagement of lymph nodesOMARROWAntibioticsfor 2 weeksRepeatFNAC",
