They are associated with hemolysis, usually seen in hereditaryspherocytosis or sickle cell disease.• Brown stones - Contain calcium bilirubinate, calcium palmitate, and calcium stearate, as well ascholesterol.

Ultrasound has a high specificity andsensitivity for cholelithiasis. It is considered as the first test of choice for delineation of any biliarypathology. Stones appear acoustically dense and also produce an acoustic shadow. They also movewith a change in posture.

      "explanation": "Non-visualization of the gallbladder in HIDA (hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid) scan is suggestiveof acute cholecystitis.Acute cholecystitis is the inflammation of the gallbladder that develops over hours, usuallybecause a gallstone obstructs the cystic duct. In the majority of cases, the process is limited by thestone slipping back into the body of the gallbladder. Clinical features include:• Pain in the right hypochondrium with referred pain to the back• Fever• Nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia•Jaundice• Positive Murphy's sign.• Positive Boas' signMurphy's sign: After asking the patient to exhale, the examiner places his hand below the costalmargin on the right side at the mid-clavicular line of the patient. The patient is then instructed totake a deep inspiration. If the patient stops breathing and winces with a 'catch' of breath,Murphy's sign is said to be positive.Boas' sign: It is the presence of an area of hyperaesthesia at the site of radiation of the pain to theback, typically, below the scapula.USG and CT scans are helpful in establishing a diagnosis. The gold standard investigation of acutecholecystitis is the HIDA scan. The radioisotope used is Technetium-99m (99mTc)-labeledderivative of iminodiacetic acid.The following image depicts the radioisotope scan in which the gallbladder is not visualized evenafter 4 hours.HIDA SCANDATE: 07-APR-2008NM 244 20085 MIN15 MIN30 MIN1 HR1.5 HRS2 HRS3 HRS4 HRS748Unlike bilirubin, iminodiacetic acid (IDA) compounds do not undergo conjugation in thehepatocytes. They are rapidly excreted into the bile. This enables excellent visualization of the bileducts and gallbladder within 30-60 minutes of injection.Since cystic duct obstruction initiates acute cholecystitis, there is non-visualization of thegallbladder 3-4 hours after the intravenous injection of 99m Tc-IDA. This is characteristic ofacute cholecystitis. Thus visualization of the GB establishes cystic duct patency and rules out acutecholecystitis.",

This in turn leads tobiliary-enteric fistula formation.757Plain radiographs demonstrate air-fluid levels consistent with a small bowel obstruction. Rigler'striad is seen in gallstone ileus. It includes:• Intestinal obstruction• Gas in the biliary tract (pneumobilia)•Ectopic gallstone (Radio-opaque shadow in the right iliac fossa)The investigation of choice is the CT scan. Pneumobilia is a ubiquitous finding because the fistulathat permitted a stone to pass into the duodenum allows air into the gallbladder and the biliarytree.•Initial management involves keeping the patient nil per-oral, IV fluids, IV antibiotics, andanalgesics.If there is no strangulation or peritonitis, it can be managed by:Milking the stone beyond ileocaecal junction•Crushing the stone• Enterotomy to remove the stoneIf there is perforation or strangulation, resection and anastomosis are done.Cholecystectomy should be performed to avoid future complications. Fistula closure can beperformed along with cholecystectomy or it can be performed later (two-stage procedure).Given below is a plain X-ray of the erect abdomen showing air in the biliary tract (pneumobilia).A large gallstone causing gallstone ileus is shown below.758",
