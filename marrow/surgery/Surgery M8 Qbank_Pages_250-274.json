      "explanation": "The gold standard in breast reconstruction with autogenous tissue is the deep inferior epigastricperforator (DIEP) flap.In DIEP flap, using a microvascular technique, only subcutaneous fat and skin are taken, and nomuscle is removed. As the muscle is spared, there is a decreased risk of abdominal wall weaknessand its associated complications..Lattismus dorsi flap (LD flap) - does not provide the bulk necessary and an implant is usuallyrequired.Transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap (TRAM flap):Skin, fat, and muscle are moved to the chest.• It is the most commonly used flap.• It provides good cosmesis and bulk. An implant is usually not required.• Since the rectus abdominis muscle is excised in the procedure, it can lead to abdominal wallweakness and hernias.The easiest type of reconstruction is using a silicone gel implant under the pectoralis majormuscle. Capsular contraction is a dreaded complication of silicone implants.In breast reconstruction surgeries, the timing of reconstruction may be immediate or delayed.Impediments to immediate reconstruction include insufficient theatre time and a lack ofexperienced reconstructive surgeons. In addition, if the patient is likely to need post-opradiotherapy, then a delayed reconstruction using a flap often gives better results.268",

Chemotherapy along with endocrine therapy, and trastuzumab isthe adjuvant treatment of choice.Positive immunohistochemistry staining is indicated by the presence of brown-colored tissue.•The Estrogen receptor (ER) and Progesterone receptor (PR) are both nuclear receptors, hence,the nucleus is stained brown if positive.• The human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) is a membrane receptor, hence thecell membrane is stained brown if positive.The image below shows positive and negative staining for ER, PR, and HER2.270(+)(-)ERPRHER2The adjuvant treatment modalities currently in practice include:• Endocrine treatment such as tamoxifen or ovarian suppression. It is given for patients withtumors that are hormone receptor-positive (either ER+ or PR+)..• Anti-HER2 therapy with trastuzumab (humanized monoclonal antibody).

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Anastrozole is an aromatase inhibitor and it is the drug of choice for the prevention of recurrenceof ER/PR positive breast cancer in post-menopausal women (usually &gt;50 years). It is given for10 years.Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and it is the drug of choice forpreventing recurrence in pre-menopausal women. It has an agonistic action on the endometrium,leading to an increased risk of endometrial cancers. Hence, it is not used in post-menopausal271women.Trastuzumab is a her2/neu receptor antagonist. It is given in patients with her2/neu statuspositive. It would not be effective in this patient.",

      "explanation": "Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is a localized form of radiation delivered afterlumpectomy to only the part of the breast where the tumor was removed. According to theupdated guidelines, patients of age greater than or equal to 50 years are considered suitable forAPBI.Patients of age &lt;40 years are considered unsuitable, while those between 40 and 49 years of ageare included in the cautionary group.According to the recent American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) guidelines, thefollowing patients are considered suitable for APBI:•• Patients of age 50 years or older• Patients with low-risk DCIS. Low-risk DCIS includes patients satisfying the following criteria-• Screen-detected disease• Low to intermediate nuclear grade• Tumor size ≤ 2.5 cm•Surgical resection with margins negative by° 3mm• Patients with surgical margins negative by ° 2mm",

They are treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy, mastectomy, and radiation therapy.Step 2: Evaluate the receptor statusThe immunohistochemistry is positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors.

Most patients present with a painless mass in the breast with or without bloody nippledischarge.Diagnosis is done by ultrasonography and tissue biopsy.Treatment of breast cancer in pregnancy involves:•Mastectomy in any trimester along with chemotherapy in the second and third trimesters.• Radiotherapy and hormonal therapies are absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy becauseof teratogenicity. They can be initiated after delivery.•Since radiotherapy is a component of breast conservation therapy, it is contraindicated in thefirst trimester of pregnancy.
