      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "A thyroglossal cyst is the only midline neck swelling that moves with deglutition. This is becausethe thyroid gland is fixed to the hyoid.Thyroglossal duct cyst:It is a congenital midline neck swelling that typically presents during childhood often noticed afteran upper respiratory infection. It represents the persistence of the track of the thyroid gland andcan be found adjacent to the midline. The thyroid gland descends early in fetal life from the baseof the tongue towards its position in the lower neck. At the time of descent, the hyoid bone has notbeen formed and the track of the thyroid gland is variable, passing in front, through, or behind theeventual position of the hyoid body.TongueForamencaecumThyroglossalductHyoidThyrohyoidmembraneCricoidcartilageThyroid-glandSites of Thyroglossal CystOMARROWFloorof mouthBeneathforamencaecumSuprahyoidInfrahyoidThyroidcartilageClinical features of thyroglossal cyst:•Classically the cyst moves upwards on swallowing and on tongue protrusion. This indicatesattachment to the hyoid bone.•Swelling is smooth, soft, fluctuant (cystic), nontender, mobile, often transilluminant..Thyroid fossa is empty, if there is no thyroid in the normal location.Complications of thyroglossal cyst:• The most common complication is infection.• Thyroglossal fistula is an acquired condition that either follows infection of the cyst which burstsopen or due to inadequate removal of the cyst.• 1% of thyroglossal duct cysts are found to be malignant of which the most common typeof cancer is papillary (85%).285Neck swellings that move with deglutition are:• Thyroid swellings•Subhyoid bursitis• Dermoid cysts attached to the hyoid boneHowever, only the thyroglossal cyst moves with tongue protrusion. This is because the ductextends from the foramen caecum of the tongue to the isthmus of the gland.Sistrunk's operation is performed to excise the cyst and prevent a recurrence. It involves theexcision of the whole thyroglossal tract, involving removal of the body of the hyoid bone,and suprahyoid tract through the tongue base to the vallecula at the site of the primitive foramencaecum along with the core of tissue on either side.",

Itis also known as struma lymphomatosa or lymphocytic thyroiditis. It is an autoimmune diseasethat results in the destruction of the thyroid gland and gradual &amp; progressive thyroid failure.Clinical features:• Most prevalent between 45-65 years of age• More common in females• Painless enlargement of the thyroid• Hashitoxicosis: When the auto-antibodies attack and damage the follicles, there is a suddenrelease of thyroid hormones from these follicles. This leads to a transient phase of thyrotoxicosis.Hypothyroidism: Since the follicles are damaged and cannot form the hormones anymore, thesepatients tend to be in a state of hypothyroidism.•Diagnosis:•T3 and T4 are low• TSH is raised.• Autoantibodies against:•Thyroid receptors• Thyroid peroxidase (TPO)• ThyroglobulinThese patients are managed with thyroid hormone replacement therapy.In patients with long-standing goiter, there is a risk of compressive features and the developmentof thyroid lymphoma. Such cases can be treated with total thyroidectomy. It may also predisposeto papillary thyroid carcinoma.Other options:Option A: Histological features of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid include polygonal tospindle-shaped cells in the form of nests, trabeculae or follicles. Small, round anaplastic cells maybe found in some cases and amyloid deposits derived from calcitonin polypeptides are present inthe stroma.The given slide below shows medullary carcinoma of thyroid:292Option C: Grave's disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by hyperthyroidism due tocirculating autoantibodies. The thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins bind to the TSH receptors,causing overgrowth of the thyroid gland and increased thyroid hormone synthesis. Histologically,there is acinar cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia with the absence of normal colloid in the tallcolumnar epithelium (normally the epithelium is flat with colloid).

It is an inflammatory condition and not aninfection as the thyroid gland is inherently resistant to infection due to its extensive blood andlymphatic supply, high iodide content, and fibrous capsule.It predominantly occurs in women between the ages of 30-40 years. The condition is self-limiting,and management is symptomatic i.e. aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs areused for pain relief, but steroids may be indicated in more severe cases.Note: Acute suppurative thyroiditis mimics De Quervain's thyroiditis in that it is often precededby a pyogenic upper respiratory tract infection or otitis media.

It canbe either primary or secondary.•Primary: rare and arises from ectopic thyroid tissue in the mediastinum; receives blood supplyfrom intrathoracic blood vessels. It is not related to thyroid tissue in the neck.•Secondary: they are the most common type; an extension of enlarged thyroid from the neck,usually arising from the lower pole of nodular goitre. It receives its blood supply from superiorand inferior thyroid vessels.The majority of patients are asymptomatic or have minimal symptoms. If the gland enlargeswithin the thoracic inlet, the pressure may lead to dysphagia, tracheal compression, andeventually airway symptoms. Pemberton sign can be positive (facial flushing and dilatation ofcervical veins upon raising the arms above the head).CECT neck and thorax is the investigation of choice.Over 95% of retrosternal goiters can be removed via a transcervical incision since they are anextension from thyroid tissue in the neck.Other options:Option A: Surgical removal of the retrosternal goiter is indicated in patients with significantairway compression, and in young patients who have symptoms such as dyspnoea or dysphagia.296Option B: Median sternotomy approach is indicated in:•Primary mediastinal goiter•Malignant retrosternal goitre•Very large retrosternal goiter•Recurrence in the mediastinumFor a primary mediastinal goiter whose boundaries are completely within the chest, resection isoften achieved through median sternotomy or thoracotomy to ensure that the vessels supplyingthe tumor are properly ligated. Removing the tumor through a cervical approach can result inuncontrolled bleeding and is generally avoided.Option C: Blood supply to the retrosternal goiter is from the thyroid vessels (secondaryretrosternal goiter).",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The last dose of carbimazole may be given the evening before surgery.Toxic adenoma is a benign functioning thyroid tumour, which usually presents as a toxic solitarynodule. It is an autonomously functioning tumour that does not respond to TSH. Treatmentinvolves antithyroid drugs or radioactive iodine. This is followed by hemithyroidectomy as thesurrounding normal thyroid tissue regains normal function.Traditional preparation of a thyrotoxic patient aims to make the patient biochemically euthyroid.There are two methods of preparation that can be used:•⚫ Carbimazole 30-40 mg per day is the drug of choice. When euthyroid (after 8-12 weeks), the dosemay be reduced. Beta-blockers, if used preoperatively, must be given on the morning of surgeryand continued for a week post-op.•• Propranolol 40 mg TDS or a longer-acting nadolol 160 mg once daily may be given to achievebeta-blockade. It is important to continue treatment up to 7 days postoperatively.Iodine may be given with carbimazole or a beta-blocker 10 days before the operation. It producestransient remission and reduces thyroid vascularity.",
