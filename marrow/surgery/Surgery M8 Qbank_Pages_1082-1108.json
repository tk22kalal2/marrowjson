      "explanation": "While all of the given options are inhibited by steroids, the major effect of steroids is to inhibit theinitial inflammatory phase of wound healing (angiogenesis, neutrophil and macrophagemigration, and fibroblast proliferation) and the release of lysosomal enzymes.The stronger the anti-inflammatory effect of the steroid compound used, the greater the inhibitoryeffect on wound healing. Steroids used after the first 3 to 4 days post-injury do not affect woundhealing as severely as when they are used in the immediate postoperative period.In addition to inhibiting collagen synthesis, steroids also inhibit epithelialization and contractionand contribute to increased rates of wound infection, regardless of the time of administration.Steroid delayed healing of cutaneous wounds can be stimulated to epithelialize by topicalapplication of vitamin A.",

      "explanation": "Everted edge around a chronic wound is a sign of malignant transformation.The majority of wounds that have not healed in 3 months are considered chronic and are prone tomalignant changes. Malignant wounds are differentiated clinically from non-malignant wounds bythe presence of overturned edges. Biopsy of the wound edges should be performed to rule outmalignancy.Malignant transformation can occur in any long-standing wound. The image shows a Marjolin'sulcer with everted edges.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Contaminated wounds older than 6 hours should be managed with delayed primary closure.The wound is cleaned, debrided, and left open for a few days. This allows soft tissues to drain andalso ensures no infection is present before surgical closure can be done.Wound closure is categorized into primary, secondary, or tertiary:Primary closure is done for clean wounds with minimal tissue loss that are amenable toapproximation of wound edges. Healing occurs by primary intention. Primary closure is ideallyperformed within 6 to 8 hrs of trauma, but wounds in vascular areas (e.g. face) may be delayed toup to 24 hours after trauma.Secondary closure allows healing by secondary intention. The wound is left open to heal largely bythe formation of granulation tissue and contraction. These wounds often have significant tissueloss precluding tension-free approximation of edges, with devitalized edges. Wound dressings arechanged daily to aid in the formation of granulation tissue and subsequent contraction.Tertiary closure, also known as delayed primary closure, results in a combination of healing byprimary and secondary intention. The wound is thoroughly irrigated, debrided, and left open for 2to 5 days before surgical closure. It is used for wounds that are grossly contaminated withoutsignificant tissue loss.",

An external pressure of &gt;30 mmHg leads to the formation of pressure sores.1097The common sites of pressure sores in decreasing frequency are the ischium, greater trochanter,sacrum, heel, malleolus (lateral followed by medial), and occiput.Pressure sores can be prevented with good skincare, the use of air-fluidized beds, specialpressure-dispersion cushions, or foams. Repositioning the patient every two hours can lessen thepressure on the area.Ulcers of stages 1 and 2 often do not require operative measures. They are managed with regularwound cleaning and dressing with a good antibiotic cover.Stage 3 and 4 ulcers are adequately debrided, and vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) is used topromote the growth of granulation tissue required for surgical closure. Large skin flaps that havemuscle with sensory innervation are best for reconstruction.",

Alginates, foams, hydrocolloids, hydrogelsare other options that are available.The aim of surgery is to fill the dead space and to provide durable sensate skin. Large skin flapsthat include muscle are best and, occasionally, an intact sensory innervated area can be included(e.g. extensor fascia lata flap with the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh).Nutritional optimization with high caloric and protein diet should be done to establish a positivenitrogen balance.

        "D": "Tensile strength is about 60-80% of normal skin by 3 months"
      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "During the first week, a surgical wound has minimal inherent strength because the dermal edgesare held together solely by a hemostatic plug and sutures.During the second postoperative week, fibroblasts proliferate rapidly and begin to produce type Icollagen in addition to type III. The strength of the wound is still limited to less than 10% of itsfinal strength. By week 6, the concentration of strong collagen fibers begins to resemble that ofintact skin.As the collagen matures and becomes denser, the scar becomes almost acellular as the fibroblastsand blood vessels reduce. The disorganized collagen fibers become aligned along stress lines withtheir strength being in their weave rather than in their amount.Most of these changes occur over the first three months but a scar will continue to mature for 1 to2 years. Tensile strength will continue to increase but would not be expected to exceed 60-80% ofthat of normal skin.",

      "explanation": "The incision for a fasciotomy involves the skin, subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and deepfascia.Fasciotomy involves incising the deep muscle fascia and is best carried out via longitudinalincisions of skin, subcutaneous fat, and superficial and deep fascia. The muscle will be seenbulging out through the fasciotomy opening.The lower limb can be decompressed via two incisions, each being lateral to the subcutaneousborder of the tibia. This gives access to the two posterior compartments and the leg's peroneal andanterior compartments.",

      "explanation": "The given image which shows a punched-out ulcer with regular margins on the plantar surface ofthe dry, crackled foot is suggestive of a neuropathic ulcer.Neuropathic ulcers occur as a result of repeated trauma to the insensitive part due to peripheralneuropathy. There is a lack of sensation over the pressure points, leading to unnoticedmicrotrauma, wounds or cuts which develop into an ulcer. Causes of neuropathic ulcers includediabetic neuropathy, B12 deficiency, alcoholism, hypothyroidism, leprosy, peripheral nerve injury,transverse myelitis and myelomeningocele.Other options:Option D: Tuberculous ulcers occur when a cold abscess from bone and joint tuberculosis breaksout on the surface. The most characteristic feature of this ulcer is its edge which is thin andundermined.
