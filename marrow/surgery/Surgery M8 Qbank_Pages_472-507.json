      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of Meckel's diverticulitis. It arises from the antimesenteric borderof the small intestine.Meckel's diverticulum is the most commonly encountered congenital anomaly of the smallintestine. Meckel's diverticulum is caused by a failure of normal regression of the vitelline duct oromphalomesenteric duct that develops during weeks 5 to 7 of gestation. It contains all 3 layers ofthe intestine and hence it is a true diverticulum.It is located 45 to 60 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. The most common heterotopic tissuewithin the Meckel's diverticulum is gastric mucosa (50%) followed by pancreatic mucosa(5%) andcolonic mucosa.Most Meckel's diverticula are benign and are incidentally discovered.

      "explanation": "The given post-op scenario after 72 hours of laparotomy with no passage of flatus, absent bowelsounds, and X-ray findings are suggestive of paralytic ileus. Initiation of oral intake andemergency laparotomy is not done in paralytic ileus.The return of normal motility post-surgery occurs in the following sequence:Small intestine (within the first 24 hours) → Stomach (within 48 hours) → Colon (3 to 5 days).Paralytic ileus is an adynamic/functional obstruction in which there is a failure of transmission ofperistaltic waves. This is secondary to neuromuscular failure in the myenteric (Auerbach's) andsubmucous (Meissner's) plexuses. Since there are no rigorous contractions, there is no colickypain.The resultant stasis leads to the following clinical features:• Abdominal distension marked and tympanitic••• Effortless vomiting• Absence of bowel sounds• Absolute constipationParalytic ileus takes on clinical significance if any of the following are observed at 72 hours afterlaparotomy after handling of the bowel:• No return of bowel sounds on auscultation• No passage of flatusRadiologically, the abdomen shows gas-filled loops of the intestine with multiple air fluid levels inan erect X-ray. A CT scan is more accurate for differentiating functional from mechanicalobstructionParalytic ileus is managed by nasogastric tube decompression and restriction of oral intake untilbowel sounds and the passage of flatus return.
