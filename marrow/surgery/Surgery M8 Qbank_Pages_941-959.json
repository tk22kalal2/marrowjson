      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of acute bacterial prostatitis and should be managed byantibiotics.A rigorous and prolonged treatment for 2-6 weeks with an antibiotic that penetrates the prostatewall is indicated (trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin or aminoglycoside). Incomplete infectioneradication lead to recurrent attacks and chronic prostatitis.Acute bacterial prostatitis is usually caused by an ascending urinary tract infection (UTI) or refluxof infected urine into prostatic ducts. The most common organism is Escherichia coli. Anassociated increase in levels of PSA(&gt;4ng/ml) may be present due to prostate inflammation.Catheterization and prostatic massage are contraindicated in patients with suspected acuteprostatitis, as they increase the chance for bacteremia and sepsis. Instead, suprapubic tap shouldbe performed to alleviate retention.•Chronic bacterial prostatitis is the sequela of inadequately treated acute prostatitis.Diagnosis includes:• Three-glass urine test - If the first glass with the initial urine sample is clear, but the second andthird samples contain prostatic threads and leukocytes, it indicates the presence of prostatitis.Digital rectal examination - Prostate may be normal, boggy, or tender.• Prostatic fluid examination - post-prostatic massage fluid shows pus cells and bacteria.",

      "explanation": "The most common organism causing acute bacterial prostatitis (ABP) is Escherichia coli.It is commonly caused by an ascending urethral infection or reflux of infected urine into prostaticducts. Sexually transmissible infections and other urinary pathogens, such as Staphylococcusaureus and Streptococcus faecalis may also be responsible.The patient presents with fever, perineal pain, chills and rigor, and dysuria. Per rectalexamination will reveal a tender, boggy prostate. Care should be taken to avoid aggressivepalpation or prostatic massage as it can lead to bacterial dissemination and sepsis.Urine examination and culture should be done. Urine examination reveals threads in urine.Management:Patients with systemic signs of infection should be admitted for IV antibiotics, hydration, andmonitoring of laboratory parameters.Patients who have no signs of systemic infection, who can tolerate oral intake, and who have nourinary retention can be treated with oral antibiotics. Antibiotics are given for 2-6 weeks to ensure949the eradication of the infection as antibiotics don't penetrate the prostate capsule easily.For outpatient therapy: Ciprofloxacin 500 mg oral every 12 hours or levofloxacin 500 mg OD ortrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole double-strength tablet oral every 12 hours can be used.For hospitalized patients: Intravenous ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin with or without anaminoglycoside (gentamicin or tobramycin) or intravenous beta-lactam with or without anaminoglycoside.

The surgical site is irrigated with a non-conducting non-ionic fluid as the use of anionic solution leads to dissipation of the cutting current and poor cutting efficacy.
