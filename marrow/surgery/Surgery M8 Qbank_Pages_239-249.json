      "question": "A postmenopausal lady presented with painless lumps in the right breast. On examination,two lumps of size 6 x 2 cm and 4 x 1 cm were palpated in the upper outer quadrant.Ipsilateral mobile axillary lymph nodes were felt. On evaluation, there was no distantmetastasis.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "TNM staging of the tumor is T3 N1 Mo.In the given scenario:• The bigger lump is 6 cm in size - T3• Ipsilateral mobile axillary lymph nodes - N1No distant metastasis - Mo.In tumor size assessment, the greatest dimension is taken into consideration. For example, in a 6x 2 cm lump, 6 cm is taken into account, and the tumor is classified as T3 (&gt;5 cm). If 2 lumpsare present in the same breast, staging is according to the bigger lump. If lumps are present inbilateral breasts, separate staging is done for both the lumps.Any contralateral lymph node involvement is considered as distant metastasis.",

This grading system is based on the following parameters:• Patient's age• DCIS nuclear grade and presence of microcalcification•Size of the lesion• Width of the surgical marginThe Nottingham prognostic index segregates the patients into four groups and is used to predictthe 5-year survival. It helps to formulate treatment plans.Nottingham Prognostic Index = (0.2 × Tumor size in cm) + grade + nodesThe Gail and Claus models are used for assessing the risk of development of breast carcinoma.It includes the following parameters:••Number of first-degree relatives with carcinoma breastAge at menarche•Age at first live birth•• Number of breast biopsiesClaus model provides individual estimates of breast cancer risk according to the decade of life,based on the presence of first- and second-degree relatives with breast cancer and their age atdiagnosis.Note: Neither the Gail model nor the Claus model accounts for the risk associated with mutationsin the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2.",
