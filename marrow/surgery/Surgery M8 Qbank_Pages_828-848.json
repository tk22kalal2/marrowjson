It normally stimulates the pancreas tosecrete a fluid with a high concentration of bicarbonate. Secretin stimulation test is a test thatmeasures the ability of the pancreas to respond to secretin.In order to perform the test, a tube is passed into the duodenum. Secretin is administeredintravenously and the contents of the duodenal secretions are aspirated and analyzed over aperiod of about 2 hours. The test becomes abnormal when ° 60% of the pancreatic exocrinefunction has been lost. This usually correlates well with the onset of chronic abdominal pain.Other investigations to diagnose chronic pancreatitis:Pancreatic calcifications can be seen on abdominal X-rays.Endoscopic ultrasound showing the presence of four or more of these following features is highlysuggestive of chronic pancreatitis:••• Presence of stones• Visible side branches.Cysts•Lobularity• An irregular main pancreatic duct• Hyperechoic foci and strands839• Dilatation of the main pancreatic duct•Hyperechoic margins of the main pancreatic ductAn abdominal CT scan is the initial modality of choice for diagnosing chronic pancreatitis.

CT angiography is the goldstandard in diagnosing hemosuccus pancreaticus.Haemosuccus pancreaticus, also known as pseudohaemobilia, is a rare cause of GI bleeding, dueto blood originating from the pancreatic duct into the duodenum via the ampulla of Vater. It isusually caused by the erosion of a pancreatic pseudocyst into the splenic artery.In hemosuccus pancreatitis, abdominal pain radiating to the back accompanied by melena is themost typical presentation. The pain usually has an up and down pattern, which means it changesin intensity over time. This is due to the transient closure of pancreatic ducts. Other featuresinclude:• Hematochezia•Hematemesis• Anemia• Jaundice• A palpable pulsatile mass with a thrill murmur• Retroperitoneal bleeding845Laboratory values show elevated lipase and low hemoglobin levels. The diagnosis is mainlythrough imaging modalities like upper GI endoscopy, ERCP, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), andcontrast-enhanced CT scan.CT angiography is the gold standard diagnostic tool.

      "question": "Detailed ExplanationsThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of chronic pancreatitis. Pain decreases or disappears asthe destruction of the pancreas progress. This is called a burned-out pancreas. This correlates withthe progression of disease from a mild or moderate stage to severe destruction of the pancreas.Chronic pancreatitis is a progressive inflammatory disease in which there is an irreversibledestruction of pancreatic tissue. It is more common in males, with a male: female ratio of 4:1.Solution to Question 2:836Alcohol consumption is the most common cause of chronic pancreatitis, accounting for 60-70%of the cases. Smoking increases the risk of alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis.Cystic fibrosis is the most common cause of chronic pancreatitis in the pediatric age group.Other causes of chronic pancreatitis include:• Pancreatic divisum• Annular pancreas• Hyperlipidemia•⚫ Hypercalcemia• Hyperparathyroidism• Chronic duct obstruction.•• Autoimmune pancreatitis• Cystic fibrosis• Tropical pancreatitis• Hereditary pancreatitisSolution to Question 3:The T in the TIGAR-O classification stands for toxic-metabolic, not trauma.The TIGAR-O classification system is an etiological approach to classify chronic pancreatitis andpancreatic exocrine insufficiency.Solution to Question 4:The given clinical scenario of chronic pancreatitis with SPINK1 mutation is suggestive of tropicalpancreatitis (nutritional pancreatitis). Tropical pancreatitis is histologically indistinguishable fromchronic alcoholic pancreatitis.Normally, if trypsinogen does become prematurely activated within the pancreas, it is inhibited bySPINK1 and then gets destroyed. A loss-of-function mutation in SPINK1 affects this process andpredisposes to tropical pancreatitis.Tropical pancreatitis is a form of idiopathic pancreatitis that begins at a young age and is usuallyseen in Indonesia, southern India (Keral",
      "options": {
        "A": ", and tropical Africa. It is associated with a highincidence of diabetes mellitus (a brittle form of pancreatogenic diabetes) and stoneformation. Causes of chronic tropical pancreatitis include:• Malnutrition• Ingestion of cyanogenic glycosides in cassava• Exposure to hydrocarbons released from kerosene or paraffin lamps837Tropical pancreatitis is histologically indistinguishable from chronic alcoholic pancreatitis.Solution to Question 5:Hereditary chronic pancreatitis is caused by the mutation of PRSS1 (protease serine 1).Hereditary pancreatitis is an autosomal dominant disorder, associated with a gain-of-functionmutation in the cationic trypsinogen gene (PRSS1) on chromosome 7q. This leads tointrapancreatic activation of trypsinogen and the production of the degradation-resistant form oftrypsin.PRSS1 mutation accounts for about two-thirds of cases of hereditary pancreatitis. There is anincreased risk of developing pancreatic cancer, particularly if the patient smokes tobacco.Option B: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene is located on thelong arm of chromosome 7, and it regulates bicarbonate and chloride concentrations inrespiratory and pancreatic secretions.•Homozygous CFTR mutations result in cystic fibrosis• Heterozygous mild CFTR mutations predispose to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and chronicpancreatitisOptions C and D: Serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1) or pancreatic secretory trypsininhibitor (PSTI) is associated with tropical calcific pancreatitis as well idiopathic chronicpancreatitis.Solution to Question 6:The clinical features and characteristic sausage-shaped appearance of the pancreas on the T2weighted image are diagnostic of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP). Serum IgG4 is normal in type 2AIP. It is elevated in type 1 AIP.Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the pancreas. Patientspresent with features of obstructive jaundice, weight loss, and mild abdominal pain.CT scan or MRI showing a diffuse enlarged, sausage-shaped pancreas is characteristic ofautoimmune pancreatitis.Serum IgG4 level is considered the best serological marker for AIP.Most of the cases resolve spontaneously. However, corticosteroid therapy is the treatment ofchoice as it causes increased remission of AIP. Also, AIP is associated with gastric ulcer formationas there are abundant IgG4 levels. Hence NSAIDs are not part of the management.They are of two types:FeaturesAgeGenderType 1 AIPElderlyMales838Type 2 AIPYoungEqualFeaturesSerum IgG4HistopathologyType 1 AIPElevatedType 2 AIPNormalLymphoplasmacytic sclerosin Idiopathic duct centric pancrInfiltrating cellsRelapse rateOther organ involvedg pancreatitisIgG4 + plasma cellsHighBiliary stricturesPseudotumorsKidneyLungOthers Retroperitoneal fibrosisSialoadenitisExtra pancreatic lesionIgG4 related diseaseeatitisGranulocytesLowNoInflammatory bowel disease(15-30%)Solution to Question 7:Rosemont's criteria for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis is based on endoscopicultrasonographic (EUS) findings.Solution to Question 8:The diagnostic test with the best sensitivity and specificity for chronic pancreatitis is the secretintest.Secretin is a hormone secreted by the small intestines. It normally stimulates the pancreas tosecrete a fluid with a high concentration of bicarbonate. Secretin stimulation test is a test thatmeasures the ability of the pancreas to respond to secretin.In order to perform the test, a tube is passed into the duodenum. Secretin is administeredintravenously and the contents of the duodenal secretions are aspirated and analyzed over aperiod of about 2 hours. The test becomes abnormal when ° 60% of the pancreatic exocrinefunction has been lost. This usually correlates well with the onset of chronic abdominal pain.Other investigations to diagnose chronic pancreatitis:Pancreatic calcifications can be seen on abdominal X-rays.Endoscopic ultrasound showing the presence of four or more of these following features is highlysuggestive of chronic pancreatitis:••• Presence of stones• Visible side branches.Cysts•Lobularity• An irregular main pancreatic duct• Hyperechoic foci and strands839• Dilatation of the main pancreatic duct•Hyperechoic margins of the main pancreatic ductAn abdominal CT scan is the initial modality of choice for diagnosing chronic pancreatitis. CT orMRI scan will show the outline of the gland, the main area of damage, and the possibilities forsurgical correction.The investigation of choice for chronic pancreatitis is MRCP with secretin stimulation. ERCP isthe gold-standard investigation. They help in identifying the presence of biliary obstruction andthe state of the pancreatic duct.Solution to Question 9:SFLT-1 (soluble FMS like tyrosine kinase-1) is not used to test pancreatic exocrine deficiency.SFLT-1 is a marker used for pre-eclampsia.Tests for pancreatic exocrinedeficiencyDirect tests:Lundh testThe pancreatic secretion is directly measured following a test mealSecretin or CCK stimulation t Following intravenous injectieston of secretin or CCK, the pancreatic secretion is measuredIndirect tests:Nitroblue tetrazolium-para-aminobenzoic acid (NBT-PABA) testPancreolauryl testMeasurement of thefecal elastaseFecal fat and weight estimation testThe NBT-PABA is administered orally and degraded in thegut by a pancreatic enzyme.The breakdown product (PABA) is absorbed by the intestine and excreted in the urine. Its urinary value is measured.Works on the similar principle of NBT-PABAA value below 100 µg/g establishes the diagnosis of severepancreatic exocrine insufficiencySolution to Question 10:840The chain of lakes appearance on pancreatography (ERCP or MRCP) is diagnostic of chronicpancreatitis.In chronic pancreatitis, there are multiple strictures and stones in the pancreatic duct. This leadsto the alternate stenosis and dilatation of the pancreatic duct leading to the chain of lakesappearance.Solution to Question 11:Renal artery stenosis and insulinoma are not complications of chronic pancreatitis.Complications of chronic pancreatitis:Intrapancreatic complications:• Pseudocysts• Duodenal or gastric obstruction• Thrombosis of splenic vein• Abscess• Perforation• Erosion into the visceral arteryInflammatory mass in the head of the pancreas• Bile duct stenosis• Portal vein thrombosis• Duodenal obstruction• Duct strictures and/or stones• Ductal hypertension and dilatation• Pancreatic carcinomaExtrapancreatic complications:• Pancreatic duct leak with ascites or fistula• Pseudocyst extension beyond lesser sac into mediastinum, retroperitoneum, lateral pericolicspaces, pelvis, or adjacent visceraSolution to Question 12:Calcium carbonate stone is the most common type of stone formed in chronic pancreatitis.Calcium and bicarbonate ions are normally present in pancreatic juice in high concentrations.Lithostathine is a potent inhibitor of calcium carbonate crystal formation. In alcoholics and inpatients with alcoholic chronic pancreatitis, lithostathine expression and secretion aredramatically inhibited leading to calcification.841Other complications of chronic pancreatitis:• Exocrine insufficiency - At least 90% of the gland needs to be dysfunctional beforemalabsorption symptoms manifest like:• Fat-soluble vitamin deficiency•Bleeding•Osteopenia• Osteoporosis• Endocrine insufficiency - Diabetes mellitus. Exocrine insufficiency usually precedes endocrineinsufficiency.• All the complications of acute pancreatitis can occur in patients with chronic pancreatitis.Solution to Question 13:The mode of administration of pancreatic enzymes in exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is throughan oral route.Effects of pancreatic enzyme replacement in chronic pancreatitis:• Reverses exocrine insufficiency• Prevents secondary complications such as metabolic bone disease due to inadequate absorptionof the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K• Reduces pain due to chronic pancreatitisPancreatic enzyme supplementation is done with meals. Non-enteric-coated tablets are degradedby gastric juice and the released enzymes inhibit cholecystokinin (CCK) secretion. This, in turn,decreases the pancreatic secretion and thereby reduces the pain caused due to the increasedaccumulation of the secretions within the pancreatic duct.Enteric-coated tablets are not degraded in the proximal small intestine and, hence, might not beeffective in reducing CCK secretion and relieving pain.Solution to Question 14:Celiac plexus block is used for pain relief in chronic pancreatitis as well as pancreatic carcinoma.It can be done using alcohol or other analgesics. It is a safe procedure, but the effect is short-lived.Solution to Question 15:Beger's procedure is the procedure of choice for patients with chronic pancreatitis, having anassociated mass in the head of the pancreas.842Beger's procedure is a duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection. It preserves the functionof the foregut. Once the pancreatic head is removed, a Roux-en-Y is created and anastomosed tothe rim of the pancreas or duodenum, pancreatic duct, and body and also the bile duct, ifinvolved.Solution to Question 16:The pancreatic duct dilation observed on pancreatography for chronic pancreatitis is classicallydescribed as a chain of lakes, which reflects the presence of multiple dilations and stenoses.When it is accompanied by intractable pain, this condition is best treated with side-to-sideRoux-en-Y pancreaticojejunostomy, also known as the modified Puestow procedure or lateralpancreaticojejunostomy.Solution to Question 17:The given clinical scenario with a history of acute pancreatitis, epigastric mass, and the CT imageshowing a cyst is suggestive of pancreatic pseudocyst. The capsule of the cyst is composed ofcollagen and granulation tissue, and it is not lined by epithelium. Hence, it is called a pseudocyst.Pseudocysts are post-inflammatory cysts that arise following an attack of mild acute pancreatitis.Formation of a pseudocyst requires 4 weeks or more from the onset of acute pancreatitis. They arealso the most common complication of chronic pancreatitis.Pseudocysts are usually solitary and most commonly seen in the lesser omental sac. The mostcommon artery involved is the splenic artery.•Complications of pancreatic pseudocyst include:• AbscessSystemic sepsis•• GI bleeding• Fistula formation• Peritonitis• Obstructive jaundice• Bowel obstruction• Hemorrhage into the cyst• HemoperitoneumPancreatic pseudocysts can be distinguished from cystic neoplasms by having high amylase levelsand absence of mucin and low serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels.843Solution to Question 18:Observation is the preferred treatment in this case since the size of the pseudocyst is &lt;6 cm andis arising from the tail of the pancreas.Indications for conservative management in pancreatic pseudocyst:• Asymptomatic patients• Pseudocysts smaller than 6 cm (according to Bailey)• Located on the tail.• No evidence of pancreatic duct obstruction or communication with the main pancreatic ductSolution to Question 19:The best treatment option for this patient would be to perform a cystogastrostomy since the sizeof the tumor is greater than 6 cm and in close proximity to the stomach.Interventions in pseudocyst are required when:•Complicated by infection• Presence of a mass effect• Diameter increasing in size or greater than 6 cm• Recurrence following the previous resectionEndoscopic drainage is usually curative.Surgical drainage is done if endoscopy is contraindicated or has failed.In this cystogastrostomy, an anterior gastrostomy is performed. Once the pseudocyst is located, itis drained through the posterior wall of the stomach using a linear stapler. The defect in theanterior wall of the stomach is closed in two layers.The image shows the procedure involved in cystogastrostomy.FeatureClose contact (<1 cm) with the stomachClose contact (<1 cm) with the duodenumCommunicating with the main pancreatic ductPancreatic duct stricture associated with a pancreatic pseudocystTreatment approachTransgastric drainageTransduodenal drainageTranspapillary drainageEndoscopic dilation and stent placement844OMARROWCystoduodenostomy is done when pseudocyst is adjacent to the duodenum, or concern aboutdisrupting pancreatic ductal entry into the duodenum.Roux-en-Y Cystojejunostomy is generally done for cysts that are neither in close proximity to thestomach and nor to the duodenum. This is generally preferred as the last resort as it is associatedwith a lot of complications.Percutaneous drainage to the exterior under radiological guidance is associated with a highrecurrence rate and high incidence of pancreatic-cutaneous fistula. Hence, it is not usually done.Solution to Question 20:The given clinical scenario is suggestive of hemosuccus pancreaticus. CT angiography is the goldstandard in diagnosing hemosuccus pancreaticus.Haemosuccus pancreaticus, also known as pseudohaemobilia, is a rare cause of GI bleeding, dueto blood originating from the pancreatic duct into the duodenum via the ampulla of Vater. It isusually caused by the erosion of a pancreatic pseudocyst into the splenic artery.In hemosuccus pancreatitis, abdominal pain radiating to the back accompanied by melena is themost typical presentation. The pain usually has an up and down pattern, which means it changesin intensity over time. This is due to the transient closure of pancreatic ducts. Other featuresinclude:• Hematochezia•Hematemesis• Anemia• Jaundice• A palpable pulsatile mass with a thrill murmur• Retroperitoneal bleeding845Laboratory values show elevated lipase and low hemoglobin levels. The diagnosis is mainlythrough imaging modalities like upper GI endoscopy, ERCP, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), andcontrast-enhanced CT scan.CT angiography is the gold standard diagnostic tool. It helps to localize the site of bleed and planthe management accordingly.Once the bleeding source is identified, hemodynamically stable patients are managed by coilembolization, balloon tamponade, or stent placement.Hemodynamically unstable patients are managed by distal pancreatectomy.Solution to Question 21:The image shows cystogastrostomy, which is done for the pancreatic pseudocyst. The pseudocystis drained through the posterior wall of the stomach.Surgery in pseudocyst is indicated for patients who fail to respond to endoscopic treatment.Pancreatic pseudocysts closely attached to the stomach should be treated with a cystogastrostomy.In this procedure, an anterior gastrostomy is performed. Once the pseudocyst is located, it isdrained through the posterior wall of the stomach using a linear stapler. The defect in the anteriorwall of the stomach is closed in two layers.Hemorrhage is the major complication expected post-surgery.Solution to Question 22:Milwaukee classification is used for the assessment of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction or dyskinesia (SOD) is a clinical syndrome in which pain,biochemical abnormalities, and dilatation of the bile duct and/or pancreatic duct are attributed toabnormal functions of the sphincter of Oddi.SOD may result from stenosis of the sphincter or from dysmotility. Scarring or stenosis of thesphincter can result from the passage of stones, pancreatitis, or prior endoscopicsphincterotomies.•Milwaukee classification of the sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) :Type I SOD is usually managed by Sphincterotomy. Whether such patients should undergo dualsphincterotomies (biliary and pancreatic) is debatable.• Type II SOD is usually assessed by a manometry first, followed by surgical or medicalmanagement based on manometry findings.• Type III SOD is difficult to manage. Surgical management, such as sphincterotomy has variableoutcomes with response rates ranging from 8% to 65%. Medical management in the form ofnifedipine, proton-pump inhibitor, botulinum toxin injection, etc. does not have long-termbenefits as well.Note:846Cystic tumors of the pancreas are classified according to Klo■ppel's classification system.Choledochal cysts are classified according to the Todani classification system.Biliary type SODBiliary-type painType I+Type II+Type III+Abnormal LFT (a)Dilated CBD(",
