      "explanation": "The critical angle of the air-cornea interface is 46 degrees. Gonioscopy is a method of evaluatingthe anterior chamber (AC) angle.Direct goniolenses include the Koeppe, Medical Workshop, Barkan, and Swan-Jacob. Indirectgoniolenses include Goldmann, Zeiss, and Posner.Structures seen on gonioscopy from anterior to posterior are:• Schwalbe line: represents the posterior limit of Descemet's membrane• Trabecular meshwork• Scleral spur•Ciliary body and root of the irisShaffers grading of angle width:Grade 4 (35-45°) is the widest angle, characteristic of myopia and pseudophakia; the ciliary bodycan be visualized without tilting the lens.Grade 3 (25-35°) is an open-angle in which the scleral spur is visible.Grade 2 (20°) is an angle in which the trabeculum but not the scleral spur can be seen.Grade 1 (10°) is a very narrow-angle in which only the Schwalbe line, and perhaps the top of thetrabeculum, can be identified.A slit angle is one in which there is no obvious iridocorneal contact but no angle structures can beidentified.Grade 0 (0°) is closed due to iridocorneal contact.Critical AngleCornea Air Interface~46 degree Light rays fromAngle exceeds Critical angle so rays reflectedback into AC (Total Internal Reflection),preventing direct visualisation of angleMWOMARROW",

Althoughneovascular glaucoma occurs as a complication in Eale's disease (Option B) and central retinalartery occlusion (Option C) and long-term use of topical steroid therapy causes steroid-inducedglaucoma (Option D) none of them are termed as 100-day glaucoma.CRVO is further classified into two types:• Non-ischemic CRVO: occurs secondary to venous stasis. It is the most common type of CRVO ofthe two.• Ischemic CRVO: occurs due to acute occlusion of the central retinal vein. It is also termed ashemorrhagic retinopathy.Ischemic CRVO presents with sudden loss of vision and Relative afferent pupil defect (RAPD).326Fundus examination shows massive enlargement of retinal veins and massive retinal hemorrhagesgiving a \"splashed tomato appearance\". Other findings include cotton wool spots, optic disc edemaand neovascularization at the disc and in the periphery.•Pathagnomic features of ischemic CRVO that differentiates it from non-ischemic CRVO are:• RAPD• Reduced amplitude of B-wave on electroretinogram• Visual field defectsComplications of the disease:• Neovascular Glaucoma known as 100 day glaucoma•Neovascularisation of iris known as Rubeosis iridis• Vitreous hemorrhage• Proliferative retinopathyThe below-given fundus image is of the \"splashed tomato\" appearance of CRVO.DAILYROUNDSOption B: Eales disease is an idiopathic inflammatory disease of the peripheral retinal veins. It isconsidered to be a hypersensitivity reaction to the tubercular proteins and it is commonly seen inyoung males. It is characterized by recurrent vitreous hemorrhage.Complications include:• Neovascular glaucoma•• Proliferative vitreoretinopathy• Tractional retinal detachment,• Rubeosis iridisOption C: Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is most often caused due to an embolus from anatherosclerotic plaque. It presents as sudden painless loss of vision and amaurosis fugax(transient monocular blindness that is due to ischemia). Fundus examination shows an opaque,327milky-white retina with a cherry-red spot.Neovascular glaucoma may occur as a delayed complication of CRAO but it is not termed as 100day glaucoma.The below image depicts the fundus image seen in CRAO with the cherry red spot.Option D:Steroid induced glaucoma is a type of secondary open angle glaucoma that usuallyfollows weeks-months of topical steroid therapy.",

Gonioscopy is a method of evaluatingthe anterior chamber (AC) angle.Direct goniolenses include the Koeppe, Medical Workshop, Barkan, and Swan-Jacob. Indirectgoniolenses include Goldmann, Zeiss, and Posner.Structures seen on gonioscopy from anterior to posterior are:• Schwalbe line: represents the posterior limit of Descemet's membrane• Trabecular meshwork• Scleral spur•Ciliary body and root of the irisShaffers grading of angle width:Grade 4 (35-45°) is the widest angle, characteristic of myopia and pseudophakia; the ciliary bodycan be visualized without tilting the lens.Grade 3 (25-35°) is an open-angle in which the scleral spur is visible.Grade 2 (20°) is an angle in which the trabeculum but not the scleral spur can be seen.Grade 1 (10°) is a very narrow-angle in which only the Schwalbe line, and perhaps the top of thetrabeculum, can be identified.A slit angle is one in which there is no obvious iridocorneal contact but no angle structures can beidentified.Grade 0 (0°) is closed due to iridocorneal contact.Critical AngleCornea Air Interface~46 degree Light rays fromAngle exceeds Critical angle so rays reflectedback into AC (Total Internal Reflection),preventing direct visualisation of angleMWOMARROWSolution to Question 3:The depth of the anterior chamber decreases with age.314Anterior chamber depth• The anterior chamber is shallow in very young and in old age.• At other periods of life, it is normally about 2.5 mm deep..•• Depth is less in women than in men.• Depth is more in myopes.• Depth is less in hypermetropia and in angle-closure glaucomaSolution to Question 4:The given clinical scenario of an infant with large corneas, lacrimation and photophobiasupported with the image is suggestive of congenital glaucoma.Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) also known as developmental glaucoma refers to abnormallyhigh intraocular pressure (IOP) which results from the developmental anomaly of the angle of theanterior chamber.It can be classified as:•True congenital or newborn glaucoma in which IOP is elevated during intrauterine life and thebaby is born with ocular enlargement.• Infantile glaucoma: which manifests prior to age 3 years.•Juvenile glaucoma: IOP rises between 3 and 16 years of age.Clinical findings include:••Blepharospasm• Buphthalmos: Large eyeball due to stretching of the globe from elevated IOP prior to the age of 3years.• Corneal enlargement:• Corneal haze is due to corneal edema..• Blue sclera - due to the shining of the underlying uveal tissue through the thinned-out sclera•Haab striae are healed breaks in Descemet's membraneTreatment:• Goniotomy - when the angle of the anterior chamber is visible through the clear cornea.•• Trabeculectomy when the corneal clouding prevents visualization of the angle.•⚫ Filtration procedures such as Trabeculectomy or combined trabeculectomy with trabeculectomyif the above procedures fail.•Glaucoma drainage devices in unresponsive cases.Other options:Option A: Retinoblastoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy of childhood thatis seen between 1-2 years.315Findings of Retinoblastoma include:• Leukocoria (white pupillary reflex)- the most common manifestation• Strabismus• Painful red eye with secondary glaucoma•An endophytic tumor grows into the vitreous as a white mass that may ‘seed' into the gel. Ifcalcification is present it gives a \"cottage cheese appearance\". An exophytic tumor grows outwardsand causes overlying exudative retinal detachment.The image below shows the leucocoria of the left eye.Option C: Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED) is an inherited corneal dystrophythat manifests since birth with endothelial degeneration. It appears as diffuse bilateral cornealedema in the absence of elevated IOP. The clinical features of the disease include cornealclouding, visual impairment, and nystagmus.Option D: Megalocornea is a bilateral non-progressive X-linked condition that most commonlyaffects males. In this condition, the horizontal corneal diameter is ≥12mm(&lt;2 years) and is ≥13mm(&gt;2 years). It is characterized by a clear cornea, normal corneal thickness, and no breaks inthe descemet's membrane. Systemic associations of Megalocornea include Marfan's syndrome,Apert syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos, and Down syndrome.Solution to Question 5:This neonate with complaints of photophobia and watering with large cornea and Haab's striae issuggestive of buphthalmos. Haab's striae are horizontal/circumferential breaks in Descemet'smembrane seen in buphthalmos.Buphthalmos (Bull-like eyes) is an enlargement of the eyeball seen in true congenital and infantileglaucoma, usually when the disease onset is before 3 years.316The image given below shows Haab's striae and a child having buphthalmos in congenitalglaucoma.EveRounds.orgNote: Vogt's striae are vertical, fine, whitish lines (folds/tears) in Descemet's membrane commonlyfound in patients with keratoconus.The image given below shows Vogt's striae.317EYE BLINDS.ORGSolution to Question 6:Frequent changes in presbyopic glasses in this patient is a symptom of open-angle glaucoma(OAG).This is due to increasing accommodative failure as a result of constant pressure on the ciliarymuscle and nerve supply.In intumescent cataracts, patients report difficulty with distance vision and frequent change ofspectacle prescription. However, it is not associated with frequent changes of presbyopic glasses.Solution to Question 7:Normal cup-to-disc ratio is up to 0.6. Although the average cup-to-disc ratio is around 0.3 to 0.4,a ratio of up to 0.6 may be found in healthy individuals. This larger ratio is frequently seen incases of large discs, myopic discs or physiological cupping. A cup-to-disc ratio of &gt; 0.6 issuggestive of glaucoma.Solution to Question 8:The given clinical scenario of a patient with headache and eye pain along with the finding of alaminar dot sign is suggestive of glaucoma.The laminar dot sign is an advanced glaucomatous change in the optic disc. This occurs becausethe pores in the lamina cribrosa are slit-shaped and are visible up to the margin of the disc.Glaucomatous changes in the optic discEarly glaucomatous changes:318• Slit defects of the retinal nerve fiber layer•Splinter hemorrhages on disc margin• Large cup - 0.7 or more• Asymmetry of the cups: A difference equal to or more than 0.2 between two eyes is significant• Vertically oval cupAdvanced glaucomatous changes:• Marked cupping (Beanpot cupping)••Thinning of neuroretinal rim• Bayonetting sign - Sharp angulation of vessel at the margin of the excavated cup• Laminar dot signSolution to Question 9:The temporal visual field is the last field to be affected in glaucoma.The pattern of visual field progression in glaucoma from early to severe is predictable in light ofthe pattern of thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer, which usually begins with the superior andinferior arcuate fibers, then the papillomacular bundle and finally, the nasal fibers.Since the nasal fibers are the last to be involved, the temporal field is the last to be affected inglaucoma.Solution to Question 10:Bjerrum scotoma (arcuate) is a late and clinically significant visual field defect.Progression of visual field changes seen in glaucoma:Early non-specific changesEarly significant changesLate significant changesIsopter contractionBaringof ablind spot:Exclusion of blindspot from the central fieldPeripheral nasal step(may beearly or late)Paracentral scotomain Bjerrum's area.Siedel's scotoma:Paracentral scotoma joins the blind spotArcuateorBjerrum scotomaRingorDoublearcuate scotoma:When 2 arcuate scotomas join togetherRoenne's central nasal step319Early non-specific changesAdvanced glaucomatous fielddefectsIsopter contractionBaringof ablind spot:Exclusion of blindspot from the central fieldTubular visionNo light perception: Complete visual field defect.Solution to Question 11:The given clinical scenario of deterioration of vision, sluggish pupils, elevated IOP and paracentralscotoma is suggestive of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Timolol is one of the first-lineagents used in the treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma.First-line agents for the treatment of glaucoma are:• Prostaglandin analogs such as latanoprost and bimatoprost••Topical beta-blockers such as timolol, betaxolol, and levobunololSelective alpha 2 adrenergic agonist brimonidineAdjunctive therapy: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitorsLaser trabeculoplasty: In cases where intraocular pressure (IOP) is uncontrolled despite maximaltolerated medical therapy.Note: Since prostaglandin (PG) analogs are not included in the options, the next best option tochoose is timolol.Historically, beta-blockers were the most common first-line agents used in the medical treatmentof POAG. However, with an increase in our experience with newer agents, specifically theprostaglandin analogues that facilitate outflow, they were recognized as being more efficacious inlowering IOP and systemically safer than beta-blockers. As a result, now they are the first-lineagents in glaucoma treatment.Solution to Question 12:This patient with a history of asthma now presenting with shortness of breath after startingmedications for increased intraocular pressure was most likely diagnosed with glaucoma. Thedrug she was likely prescribed was timolol, a non-selective beta blocker.Timolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that is used in glaucoma. Non-selective beta-blockers cancause precipitation of bronchial asthma in susceptible individuals (beta-2 block on bronchi). Theycause bronchospasms and are therefore contraindicated in patients with asthma (e.g. timolol,levobunolol). Ocular beta-blockers reduce intraocular pressure by decreasing aqueousformation by blockade of ẞ2 receptors. Timolol is specifically associated with allergicblepharoconjunctivitis and punctal stenosisSide effects: Systemic: Bronchospasm, bradycardia, decreased cardiac output, hypotension,depression, impotence, and altered lipid profile.320Contraindications: Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, sinusbradycardia, and atrioventricular blocksOther options:Option A: The patient has been stable on aspirin for the past three years which is unlikely to bethe cause of her current symptoms.Option B: Betaxolol is a beta 1 selective blocker that is used in glaucoma and has a lowerpropensity to precipitate bronchial asthma.Option C: Latanoprost is a prostaglandin (PGF2 alph",

        "A": "analog and does not precipitate bronchialasthma.Solution to Question 13:Brimonidine is an anti-glaucoma medication that can cause drowsiness.It is a selective alpha-2 agonist. It can cross the blood-brain barrier and, hence, causes drowsinessand CNS depression; it is contraindicated in infants and children.A new class of glaucoma drugs, Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitors, promises to act specifically on thetrabecular meshwork, a main outflow and blockage site in glaucoma. ROCK inhibitors are not yetapproved and available for glaucoma patients. Two US companies, Aerie and Altheos, arecurrently in early clinical research development with topical ROCK inhibitors to lower IOP.Solution to Question 14:This patient with complaints of severe headache, corneal congestion, and edema with a shallowanterior chamber most likely has acute angle closure glaucoma. Since this patient has a pasthistory of sickle cell disease, intravenous mannitol is the drug of choice for this patientAcetazolamide is contraindicated in cases of sickle-cell anemia since these drugs tend to increasesickling of erythrocytes.Solution to Question 15:The given clinical scenario, supported with the image of the mid-dilated and vertically oval pupilis suggestive of acute angle-closure glaucoma. The pupil is non-reactive to both light andaccommodation.Acute primary angle-closure glaucoma refers to the occlusion of the trabecular meshwork by theperipheral iris (iridotrabecular contact [ITC]), obstructing aqueous outflow.Angle closure can be primary, when it occurs in an anatomically predisposed eye or secondary toanother ocular or systemic factor.Classification:321Symptoms: Pain, redness, photophobia, impaired vision, wateringSigns:•Corneal edema- colored halos•Conjunctiva- congestion, chemosis• IOP- elevated 40-70 mm Hg• AC very shallow•Pupil- vertically oval, mid-dilated.•Angle- completely closed, Grade oTreatment:• Immediate- Intravenous mannitol, intravenous acetazolamide followed by oral dose, topicalbeta-blockers, brimonidine, latanoprost•• Definitive- Laser peripheral iridotomy, filtration surgeryPrimary angle-closure suspect (PACS)Primary angle closure (PAC)Primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG)Gonioscopy shows posteriormeshwork ITC in three or more quadrants but no peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS).Intraocular pressure (IOP), optic disc, and visual field are normal.No PAS are seenThe risk of PACG at 5 years may bearound 30%.Gonioscopy shows three or more quadrants of ITC with raised IOP and/or PAS or excessive pigment smudging on theTM.Normal optic disc and field.ITC in three or more quadrants, with glaucomatous opticneuropathy.Optic nerve damage from an episode of severeIOP elevation, such as acuteangle closure, may not appear as typical glaucomatous cupping.Solution to Question 16:Pain after dark-room prone-provocative test indicates occludable angles. Hence, atropine iscontraindicated as it is a long-acting mydriatic and can precipitate angle closure.Dark-room/prone-provocative test (DRPPT)- The patient sits in a dark room, face down for onehour without sleeping (sleep induces miosis). The intraocular pressure (IOP) is checked322(immediately after the test, as IOP can normalize very rapidly), and an IOP rise of 8 mmHg ormore is frequently considered significant.Solution to Question 17:The given clinical scenario of sudden onset severe pain in the eye, progressive loss ofvision, shallow anterior chamber, semi-dilated pupil, and edematous cornea is suggestive ofacute angle-closure glaucoma. Laser iridotomy is the procedure of choice especially in emergencysituations.The attack may have been precipitated by pupillary dilation, which may result from activities suchas going to a movie theater. Laser iridotomy re-establishes the communication between theposterior and anterior chamber, bypassing the pupillary block; hence, it immediately relievescrowding of the angle.Various surgical and laser modalities used in glaucoma:Angle-closure glaucoma:•⚫ Laser iridotomy by Nd:Yag along with prophylactic iridotomy of the other eye → Treatment ofchoice.• Trabeculectomy → Filtration surgeryCongenital glaucoma:• Goniotomy• TrabeculotomyPrimary open-angle glaucoma:••• Laser trabeculoplasty: Argon or diode (if not controlled medications)Trabeculectomy: Filtration surgery (if not controlled medications)Absolute glaucoma:•⚫ Cyclocryotherapy•Nd:Yag lasercyclo destructionSolution to Question 18:The clinical vignette points to a diagnosis of glaucoma not responsive to medical treatment andtrabeculectomy and the device used is an ex-Press™ glaucoma implant (mini shunt).It is a form of minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) to increase aqueous drainage.Ex-PRESS glaucoma implant is a small stainless steel device. It is inserted under a scleral flapduring a modified trabeculectomy. Complications such as hypotony are lower than with standardtrabeculectomy.323Glaucoma drainage devices are devices that allow aqueous outflow by establishing communicationbetween the anterior chamber and sub-Tennon's space/sub-conjunctival space. While thesedevices were traditionally reserved for high-risk patients, or after trabeculectomy had failed, theyare becoming increasingly popular.The commonly used devices are as follows:1. Shunts using episcleral explants•Ahmed glaucoma valve: Silicone• Molteno implant - Polypropylene plate and silicone plate•Baerveldt implant - Silicone2. Mini-shunts• Ex-Press™ Mini-Shunt: Stainless steel⚫iStentⓇ Titanium-Solution to Question 19:Glaukomflecken is anterior subcapsular lenticular opacity and a component of Vogt's triad seen inpatients after an acute angle closure glaucoma attack.The Vogt's triad comprises of:•Glaukomflecken• Patches of iris atrophy• Slightly dilated nonreactive pupilSolution to Question 20:The given scenario fits the description of glaucomatocyclitic crisis.Glaucomatocyclitic crisis/Posner-Schlossman Syndrome [PSS]) describes recurrent attacks ofunilateral acute raised intraocular pressure (IOP) associated with mild anterior uveitis. Themechanism is thought to be acute trabeculitis, and there is evidence that infection, possiblycytomegalovirus (CMV) or Helicobacter pylori, may play a role. PSS typically affects young tomiddle-aged adults. Males are affected more frequently than females.•Signs:Slit-lamp biomicroscopy typically shows a few anterior chamber cells and one to several finewhite central keratic precipitates.•Mydriasis is common; posterior synechiae are not a feature.•• IOP is typically raised to over 40 mmHg, out of proportion to iritis severity.• Gonioscopy shows an open-angle.324Treatment:• Topical steroids are used to control inflammation, with aqueous suppressants to lower the IOP.•Topical or oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents may also be beneficial.Note: In PSS, the rise in IOP is out of proportion to the pain felt. There is often a mild discomfortand pain may even be absent.Solution to Question 21:The given image shows a pattern of the deposition of pigments on the back of the cornea inpigmentary glaucoma. They are called Krukenberg spindles.Pigmentary glaucoma is an open-angle glaucoma having the following features:• Krukenberg spindlesGonioscopy shows pigment accumulation along the Schwalbe line inferiorly, and thisaccumulation is called the Sampaolesi line.• Radial transillumination defect in the iris is a pathognomonic feature.• Pigment granules may be deposited on the anterior surface. There may be a Scheie line orZentmayer ring of pigment on the peripheral/equatorial surface around the zonular insertions.Other options:Option A: Ferry line: Corneal epithelial iron line at the edge of filtering blebs of glaucoma surgeryOption B: Fleischer line/ring: Epithelial iron deposits at the base of the cone in keratoconusOption C: Hudson-Stahli line: Iron deposition line in the corneal epithelium, which is commonlyseen in the junction between middle and lower third cornea. This finding is mainly age-related.Solution to Question 22:Malignant glaucoma is seen after intra-ocular surgery (usually after trabeculectomy).Ciliary block glaucoma is also called malignant glaucoma/inverse glaucoma. It can be seen afterany intraocular surgery. Forward flow of the aqueous is blocked as tips of ciliary processes rotateforward and press against the lens/intraocular lens (IOL)/anterior hyaloid of the vitreous. Hence,aqueous humor starts collecting in the vitreous cavity.•Signs:•High intraocular pressure (IOP) and absent bleb.Negative Seidel test.• Shallow anterior chamber (AC)Treatment:325• Initial treatment is with cycloplegics (atropine 1%) to dilate the ciliary ring and push thevitreous-lens-iris posteriorly.•Subsequent treatment if medical therapy fails is with Nd:YAG laser hyaloidotomy.• Pars plana vitrectomy can be considered in conditions that don't respond to the above treatmentmodalities.Solution to Question 23:Progressive atrophy of iris stroma is a clinical entity of iridocorneal endothelial syndrome (ICE).ICE syndrome is a proliferative endotheliopathy, which leads to secondary angle-closureglaucoma.It includes three clinical entities:Progressive iris atrophy• Chandler's syndrome - corneal edema• Cogan-Reese syndrome - nodules and nevus on the iris; hence, it is known as iris nevussyndrome.Solution to Question 24:Hypersecretory glaucoma is associated with epidemic dropsy.Epidemic dropsy occurs due to Argemone mexicana poisoning. Here, glaucoma is due to excessiveproduction of aqueous humor.Solution to Question 25:100-day glaucoma is a neovascular glaucoma that occurs in ischemic type of central retinal veinocclusion (CRVO).It is known as 100-day glaucoma because it occurs 3 months after the episode of CRVO. Althoughneovascular glaucoma occurs as a complication in Eale's disease (Option",

        "C": "and long-term use of topical steroid therapy causes steroid-inducedglaucoma (Option",
        "D": "none of them are termed as 100-day glaucoma.CRVO is further classified into two types:• Non-ischemic CRVO: occurs secondary to venous stasis. It is the most common type of CRVO ofthe two.• Ischemic CRVO: occurs due to acute occlusion of the central retinal vein. It is also termed ashemorrhagic retinopathy.Ischemic CRVO presents with sudden loss of vision and Relative afferent pupil defect (RAPD).326Fundus examination shows massive enlargement of retinal veins and massive retinal hemorrhagesgiving a \"splashed tomato appearance\". Other findings include cotton wool spots, optic disc edemaand neovascularization at the disc and in the periphery.•Pathagnomic features of ischemic CRVO that differentiates it from non-ischemic CRVO are:• RAPD• Reduced amplitude of B-wave on electroretinogram• Visual field defectsComplications of the disease:• Neovascular Glaucoma known as 100 day glaucoma•Neovascularisation of iris known as Rubeosis iridis• Vitreous hemorrhage• Proliferative retinopathyThe below-given fundus image is of the \"splashed tomato\" appearance of CRVO.DAILYROUNDSOption B: Eales disease is an idiopathic inflammatory disease of the peripheral retinal veins. It isconsidered to be a hypersensitivity reaction to the tubercular proteins and it is commonly seen inyoung males. It is characterized by recurrent vitreous hemorrhage.Complications include:• Neovascular glaucoma•• Proliferative vitreoretinopathy• Tractional retinal detachment,• Rubeosis iridisOption C: Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is most often caused due to an embolus from anatherosclerotic plaque. It presents as sudden painless loss of vision and amaurosis fugax(transient monocular blindness that is due to ischemia). Fundus examination shows an opaque,327milky-white retina with a cherry-red spot.Neovascular glaucoma may occur as a delayed complication of CRAO but it is not termed as 100day glaucoma.The below image depicts the fundus image seen in CRAO with the cherry red spot.Option D:Steroid induced glaucoma is a type of secondary open angle glaucoma that usuallyfollows weeks-months of topical steroid therapy.Solution to"
