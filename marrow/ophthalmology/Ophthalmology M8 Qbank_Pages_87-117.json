        "C": "Adenovirus type 32",
        "D": "Coxsackie B virus"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Moraxella species, a type of gram-negative diplobacilli, are involved in causing angular conjunctivitis, which is a type of chronic conjunctivitis. Angular conjunctivitis is a chronic type of conjunctivitis where there is inflammation of the conjunctiva at the lid margins and the inner and outer canthi of the eyes, with red, scaly, excoriated, macerated, and fissured skin at the canthi. This is because of the proteolytic enzymes secreted by the Moraxella species. Patients with angular conjunctivitis usually experience eye irritation, a burning sensation, and collection of dirty-white, foamy discharge at the angles. These patients can also have associated blepharitis and papillary and follicular conjunctivitis. Causative organisms are Moraxella lacunata, Moraxella axenfeld, and Staphylococcus aureus (a rare cause). The source of infection is typically the nasal tract or the nasal discharge of patients with angular conjunctivitis. The infection spreads from the nasal cavity to the eyes through contaminated hands or handkerchiefs. Treatment includes oxytetracycline 1% ointment for 10 to 14 days, and zinc oxide, as it inhibits proteolytic enzymes. Other options: Option B: Haemophilus influenzae causes acute conjunctivitis. Option C: Adenovirus is the most common cause of viral conjunctivitis and it most commonly causes follicular conjunctivitis, pharyngoconjunctival fever, and epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. Option D: Coxsackie B virus is known to cause aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, pericarditis, and myocarditis. There are no known mentions of ocular disease caused by the virus. Note: Pathogens that cause bacterial conjunctivitis. The below-given table elaborates on the type of conjunctivitis caused by different serotypes of adenovirus. Hyperacute (symptoms develop within 24 hours; aggressive course), Acute (resolving in less than 4 weeks), Chronic (of greater than 4 weeks' duration). Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella lacunata, Haemophilus influenzae, Enteric bacteria. Conjunctivitis type: Follicular Conjunctivitis, Pharyngoconjunctival Fever, Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis. Adenovirus serotype: Adenovirus serotypes 1-11 and 19, Adenovirus serotypes 3, 4, and 7, Adenovirus serotypes 8, 19, and 37.",

      "question": "A child presents with irritation and redness of the left eye at a primary health center. There are no previous immunization records. Examination showed a greyish-white membrane over the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva which bled on peeling. What is the likely etiology?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Corynebacterium diphtheriae",

        "D": "Chlamydia trachomatis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The case of a child with irritation and redness of the eye with no previous vaccination records is suggestive of a case of membranous conjunctivitis, and among the given options, Corynebacterium diphtheriae is the most likely etiological agent. Membranous conjunctivitis presents with irritation and redness of the eye and is characterized by the formation of a greyish-white membrane that bleeds on peeling. Vaccines are routinely used to prevent diphtheria infection, and hence, an unvaccinated status increases susceptibility to the bacteria. Moreover, the bacteria thrive in crowded populations and poor hygienic surroundings; hence, a background of low socioeconomic context, such as an orphanage, acts as a risk factor in this case. This condition is associated with the formation of fibrinous exudates on the surface and into the substance of the conjunctival epithelium. The causes include beta-hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus aegyptius, Corynebacterium diphtheria, and Neisseria gonorrhea. The image given below shows the eye of a patient with pseudomembranous conjunctivitis. It differs from membranous conjunctivitis in that the membrane can be easily peeled off in this condition, leaving an intact underlying epithelium.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "This child with pharyngitis and subsequent involvement of the eyes most likely has pharyngoconjunctival fever. This condition is commonly caused by adenovirus serotypes 3, 4, and 7. Pharyngoconjunctival fever is an acute and highly infectious illness characterized by fever, pharyngitis, acute follicular conjunctivitis, and regional lymphoid hyperplasia with tender, enlarged preauricular adenopathy. Within the classical triad, symptoms may vary in severity. It is usually bilateral, with one eye typically having onset 1-3 days prior to the second eye. It is a self-limiting disease and treatment is mainly symptomatic, as follows: cold compresses several times per day for 1-2 weeks, and artificial tears 4-8 times per day for 1-3 weeks. Newcastle conjunctivitis is usually clinically indistinguishable from this condition and is derived from contact with diseased fowls. Another conjunctivitis caused by adenovirus serotypes 8, 19, and 37 is known as epidemic keratoconjunctivitis.",

      "explanation": "The image given above shows a subconjunctival hemorrhage in the eye. In this condition, the blood gets absorbed gradually in 1-3 weeks' time without treatment. A subconjunctival hemorrhage is also called subconjunctival ecchymosis. It is due to the rupture of small blood vessels and can occur spontaneously in elders with systolic hypertension or after local trauma. The condition is commonly associated with a benign course, but if the posterior limit of the hemorrhage is not seen, one should check for a base of the skull fracture. Recurrent episodes warrant investigations for a bleeding diathesis or leukemia. The use of NSAIDs and aspirin to treat the condition should be avoided.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is caused by picornaviruses, namely Enterovirus 70. Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, also known as 'Apollo conjunctivitis', is caused by picornaviruses such as Enterovirus 70 and Coxsackievirus A24. Rarely, it is also caused by Adenovirus type 11. It manifests with severe conjunctival congestion, chemosis, subconjunctival hemorrhages, painful follicular conjunctivitis, tearing, lid edema, and pre-auricular lymphadenopathy. The cornea may demonstrate a fine punctate keratopathy. The disease is usually self-limiting, running a course of 3-7 days. The image given below shows the eyes of a patient with acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis. Enterovirus 71 (Option D) is associated with fatal meningitis, encephalitis, and paralysis.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of right eye redness with pain, and findings of a raised whitish-yellowish lesion surrounded by mild erythema, points toward a likely diagnosis of pterygium. A history of trekking, along with chronic sunlight exposure as a farmer, acts as a risk factor because it increases the exposure to the stronger UV radiation in the mountains. Pterygium has a fatty appearance and is usually bilateral. They are more often located nasally than temporally. It has horizontally oriented areas of bulbar conjunctival thickening that adjoin the limbus in the palpebral fissure area. They are associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased incidence of age-related macular degeneration. It is seen in most eyes by 70 years of age and in almost all by 80 years of age. Pterygium responds to a brief course of NSAIDs or topical corticosteroids. Simple excision may be warranted in rare cases, wherein pterygia may be chronically inflamed or cosmetically unsatisfactory.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The likely diagnosis, based on the above image, is pterygium. Pterygium is a subconjunctival fibrovascular tissue encroaching the cornea. It is a degenerative condition of the sub-conjunctival tissue and is never inflammatory. It occurs due to exposure to UV-B radiation, and the most common site is the nasal. It is made up of three parts: a 'cap' (an avascular halo-like zone at the advancing edge), a head, and a body. Clinical features: \n   • Astigmatism with the rule - most common finding\n   • Stocker's line - deposition of iron on the advancing edge\n   • Fuchs' islets - small, discrete, whitish flecks consisting of clusters of pterygial epithelial cells, often present at the advancing edge.\n   The differential diagnosis is pseudo-pterygium. The treatment for pterygium is usually excision. To prevent a recurrence, mitomycin C or 5-fluorouracil is used. Other methods: \n   • Auto-grafting - Conjunctival limbal autograft (CLAG) from the superior limbal conjunctiva is the best method.\n   • Bare sclera technique - high recurrence rate of 30 to 80%.\n   • PERFECT surgery - zero rates of recurrence.
