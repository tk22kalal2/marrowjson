      "explanation": "167Based on the given clinical scenario and ocular finding depicted here, it is suggestive ofband-shaped keratopathy, and systemic lupus erythematosus is not associated with thiscondition.Band-shaped keratopathy (BSK) is due to calcium deposition, primarily in the form ofhydroxyapatite, in the epithelial basement membrane, Bowman's layer, and the anterior stroma.Initially, these deposits are grey but may become chalky-white as the degeneration progresses.It typically presents as a band-shaped opacity in the interpalpebral zone with a clear intervalbetween the ends of the band and the limbus. The condition begins at the periphery and graduallyprogresses towards the centre. The surface of this opaque band is stippled due to holes in thecalcium plaques in the area of nerve canals of Bowman's membrane.Causes of band-shaped keratopathy include local causes such as chronic ocular irritation orinflammatory conditions and systemic diseases that elevate serum calcium levels:Treatment:••Medical management- Chelation using topical ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 1.5–3.0%Surgical management- Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) using excimer laser or manualsuperficial keratectomyLocal causesChronic anterior uveitis (especially inJuvenile Idiopathic Arthritis) Interstitial keratitisSuperficial keratitisPhthisis bulbiEnd-stage glaucomaSilicone oil left in the aphakic eyeSystemic diseasesHyperparathyroidismSarcoidosis Multiple myelomaHypophosphatemiaPaget diseaseChronic renal failure",

It improves cosmetic appearance by altering the whitecolour of the opacity and blending it to normal eye colour.Depending on the density, corneal opacities are graded as nebula, macula and leucoma.•Nebular corneal opacity (fog or mist):• Hard-to-see corneal scar, due to superficial scars involving Bowman's layer and superficialstroma.•Slit-lamp detection is required.• A thin, diffuse nebula covering the pupillary area interferes more with vision than the localisedleucoma away from the pupillary area. Nebula produces more discomfort due to blurred image(irregular astigmatism).168• Macular corneal opacity:• Semi-dense opacity that can be seen with proper illumination.• Due to scarring involving about half the corneal stroma.•Leucomatous corneal opacity (leucoma simplex):•White scar that is easily seen just by looking at the eye.• Due to scarring of more than half of the stroma• Adherent leucoma:.• It results when healing occurs after perforation of the cornea with incarceration of irisSecondary changes in corneal opacity which may be seen in long-standing cases include hyalinedegeneration, calcareous degeneration, pigmentation and atheromatous ulceration.Treatment:•Keratoplasty is the treatment of choice in leucomatous corneal opacities.• Optical iridectomy may be performed in cases with central adherent leucomas⚫ Phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) performed with excimer laser is useful only in superficial(nebular) corneal opacities.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A 30-year-old individual with corneal changes, as shown above, known as gerontoxon or arcuslipoides, may require screening for underlying lipid disorder.Arcus senilis (AS), also known as gerontoxon, arcus lipoides or arcus cornealis, is usually anage-related lipid degeneration of the peripheral cornea that forms a light grey or bluish ring. It isthe most common peripheral corneal opacity, typically benign, occurring bilaterally and prevalentamong the elderly.However, when observed in individuals under 50, termed arcus juvenilis, it may indicateunderlying lipid disorder and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, warranting lipid profilescreening. Unilateral cases of arcus senilis may indicate contralateral carotid artery stenosis dueto decreased ophthalmic blood flow on the ipsilateral side, resulting in protection from formingarcus in the ipsilateral eye.The condition results from the leakage of lipoproteins (phospholipids and cholesterol) from limbalcapillaries into the corneal stroma, initiating deposition at the superior and inferior cornea. Overtime, the ring progresses circumferentially, sparing a clear corneal zone adjacent to the limbuscalled the interval of Vogt.The following opacities and rings can resemble arcus senilis:•Kayser- Fleischer (KF) ring: A dark brown ring caused by the deposition of excess copper inDescemet's membrane, classically seen in Wilson's disease. It may also be seen in certain chronic,cholestatic liver conditions such as primary biliary cirrhosis.• Limbus sign: Caused by dystrophic calcification, seen as a \"milky precipitate\" at the corneallimbus. It can sometimes be confused with AS in the elderly population.• Pseudo-gerontoxon: A greyish peri-limbal band of superficial scarring adjacent to a previouslyinflamed segment of the limbus resembling AS, seen in vernal keratoconjunctivitis.The image below depicts the Kayser-Fleischer ring and anterior capsule of the crystalline lens(Sunflower cataract) seen in Wilson's disease.171",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The described corneal findings, with his classic history of welding less than 12 hours prior topresentation, are suggestive of photophthalmia.Photophthalmia is produced due to exposure to short-wavelength ultraviolet (UV-B) rays. Thecornea absorbs the majority of UV light (especially 311 to 290 nm). It results in desquamation ofthe epithelium leading to multiple painful corneal erosions. Causes of of UV keratitis:The symptoms appear characteristically after a latent period of 4-5 hours of exposure toultraviolet light. There is intense burning pain, foreign body sensation, and watering of the eyes.There may be associated marked photophobia and blepharospasm. On slit-lamp examination,corneal epithelium shows a breach in continuity and takes up fluorescein stain.Management comprises cold compresses, lubricant eye drops and bandaging eyes for 24 hourswith antibiotic eye ointment and cycloplegic. Avoid local surface topical anaesthesia.

It manifests as characteristiccone-like steepening of the cornea associated with irregular stromal thinning, resulting in acone-like bulge (protrusion) and significant loss of vision.The pathogenesis is not fully known. Several associations have been identified, which include rigidcontact lens wear, chronic eye rubbing, Down's syndrome, atopic disease, Leber's congenitalamaurosis, and connective tissue disease.It is a non-inflammatory disease. With the exception of the significant loss of vision, other classicsigns of inflammation are not usually present. The asymmetrical thinning and the highly irregularcorneal topography often causes significant myopia and irregular astigmatism.Corneal topography is the primary diagnostic tool for KCN detection.Whereas keratoplasty, historically has been the mainstay of treatment for keratoconus, it is nowgenerally reserved for eyes that are unable to achieve functional vision with other surgical ornon-surgical modalities and is only considered only as a last resort, in very advanced disease.

      "explanation": "Vision correction with spectacles with spherical/toric soft contact lenses is suboptimal and onlyapplicable to the early stages of keratoconus, not in the advanced stages.Keratoconus is a progressive, non-inflammatory, bilateral corneal ectasia characterized bycone-like steepening due to irregular stromal thinning. This leads to a conical corneal protrusion,significant vision loss, myopia and irregular astigmatism.The available options for the management of keratoconus are highly dependent on the stage of thedisease and its progression. If the disease is stabilized (no progression), the emphasis is given tocorrecting the vision. If the disease is progressing, the emphasis is on slowing (arresting) theprogression.•Treatment options in moderate-to-advanced keratoconus:Rigid gas-permeable contact lenses and vaulting scleral lenses are the mainstays of visiontreatment for moderate to advanced KCN. Their main advantage is the creation of a tear poolbetween the lens and the cornea, which naturally neutralizes the ocular aberrations associatedwith keratoconus.

      "question": "Detailed ExplanationsBand-shaped keratopathy is caused by pathological calcium deposition on the cornea in the formof a band.On exam, there is a white band-like formation of calcium across the corneal surface with irregularborders and a peripheral clearing of cornea between the calcium deposits and the limbus. Thecalcium deposition is typically found beneath the epithelial layer within Bowman's layer but mayextend into the anterior stroma.Once the visual axis starts to get involved, there will be progressive loss of vision. Recurrence iscommon unless the predisposing cause is identified and treated.Local causes such as chronic ocular irritation or inflammatory conditions and systemicdiseases that elevate serum calcium levels are the main causes for band-shaped keratopathy. Itcan rarely have hereditary causes as well.Image given below shows band-shaped keratopathy.Solution to Question 2:167Based on the given clinical scenario and ocular finding depicted here, it is suggestive ofband-shaped keratopathy, and systemic lupus erythematosus is not associated with thiscondition.Band-shaped keratopathy (BSK) is due to calcium deposition, primarily in the form ofhydroxyapatite, in the epithelial basement membrane, Bowman's layer, and the anterior stroma.Initially, these deposits are grey but may become chalky-white as the degeneration progresses.It typically presents as a band-shaped opacity in the interpalpebral zone with a clear intervalbetween the ends of the band and the limbus. The condition begins at the periphery and graduallyprogresses towards the centre. The surface of this opaque band is stippled due to holes in thecalcium plaques in the area of nerve canals of Bowman's membrane.Causes of band-shaped keratopathy include local causes such as chronic ocular irritation orinflammatory conditions and systemic diseases that elevate serum calcium levels:Treatment:••Medical management- Chelation using topical ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDT",

It improves cosmetic appearance by altering the whitecolour of the opacity and blending it to normal eye colour.Depending on the density, corneal opacities are graded as nebula, macula and leucoma.•Nebular corneal opacity (fog or mist):• Hard-to-see corneal scar, due to superficial scars involving Bowman's layer and superficialstroma.•Slit-lamp detection is required.• A thin, diffuse nebula covering the pupillary area interferes more with vision than the localisedleucoma away from the pupillary area. Nebula produces more discomfort due to blurred image(irregular astigmatism).168• Macular corneal opacity:• Semi-dense opacity that can be seen with proper illumination.• Due to scarring involving about half the corneal stroma.•Leucomatous corneal opacity (leucoma simplex):•White scar that is easily seen just by looking at the eye.• Due to scarring of more than half of the stroma• Adherent leucoma:.• It results when healing occurs after perforation of the cornea with incarceration of irisSecondary changes in corneal opacity which may be seen in long-standing cases include hyalinedegeneration, calcareous degeneration, pigmentation and atheromatous ulceration.Treatment:•Keratoplasty is the treatment of choice in leucomatous corneal opacities.• Optical iridectomy may be performed in cases with central adherent leucomas⚫ Phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) performed with excimer laser is useful only in superficial(nebular) corneal opacities.Solution to Question 4:Keratoglobus is least likely to be associated with bilateral corneal opacities in a neonate. Here, thecornea is clear.Keratoglobus is a rare noninflammatory, familial disorder marked by generalised thinning andglobular protrusion of the cornea. It can be congenital or acquired. The thinning is usuallygreatest at corneal periphery or midperiphery. It can cause refractive errors, otherwise, cornea isclear, normal angle of anterior chamber, normal intraocular pressure with no optic disc cupping.Intrastromal ring segments and cross-linking can be used for management.Other options:Option B: Birth injuries resulting in Descemet's membrane tears can also cause corneal opacities.Option C: Peter's anomaly, also known as iridocorneal adhesions or keratolenticular adhesions, isa posterior corneal defect with an overlying stromal opacity.Option D: Sclerocornea is a congenital disorder in which the cornea is opaque and resembles thesclera, making the limbus indistinct. The central cornea is clearer than the periphery.Solution to Question 5:Neurotrophic keratopathy is caused by trigeminal nerve palsy.169Lesions of the fifth cranial nerve from the trigeminal nucleus to the cornea may lead toabnormalities of the normal corneal sensation and trophic stimulation.Causes:• Varicella-zoster (most common cause)• Herpes simplex keratitis• Trauma• Irradiation to the eye• Aneurysm/stroke• Multiple sclerosisMackie characterized three stages of neurotrophic keratitis.•Stage I is characterized by an irregular corneal surface, which later develops into an easilyrecognized punctate keratitis.•Stage II is characterized by a frank epithelial defect, which is typically associated with mildanterior stromal oedema and inflammation.•Stage III involves stromal melting and occasionally perforation.Solution to Question 6:Exposure keratopathy is caused by paralysis of the facial nerve.It is the result of incomplete lid closure (lagophthalmos) resulting in drying of the cornea (despitenormal tear production).Causes:• Neuroparalytic, e.g., facial nerve palsy• Reduced muscle tone as in parkinsonism• Mechanical such as lid scarring•ProptosisNote: Neurotrophic keratopathy is due to loss of trigeminal nerve innervation resulting in partialor complete loss of sensation.Solution to Question 7:Erythromycin is least likely associated with cornea verticillata/vortex keratopathy, a whorl-likeopacity in corneal epithelium, as shown in the image above.Vortex keratopathy occurs due to corneal deposits in the basal epithelium. They are almost alwaysbilateral and are readily recognisable by their distinct appearance as fine, golden-brown or greyopacities that branch out from a central whorl, usually across the inferior cornea. Opacity due to170drugs is reversible upon stopping the drug.Causes:••Amiodarone (most common) (Option A)• Tamoxifen (Option C)•• Indomethacin• Chloroquine (Option D)●•Chlorpromazine (rarely)Fabry's diseaseSolution to Question 8:A 30-year-old individual with corneal changes, as shown above, known as gerontoxon or arcuslipoides, may require screening for underlying lipid disorder.Arcus senilis (AS), also known as gerontoxon, arcus lipoides or arcus cornealis, is usually anage-related lipid degeneration of the peripheral cornea that forms a light grey or bluish ring. It isthe most common peripheral corneal opacity, typically benign, occurring bilaterally and prevalentamong the elderly.However, when observed in individuals under 50, termed arcus juvenilis, it may indicateunderlying lipid disorder and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, warranting lipid profilescreening. Unilateral cases of arcus senilis may indicate contralateral carotid artery stenosis dueto decreased ophthalmic blood flow on the ipsilateral side, resulting in protection from formingarcus in the ipsilateral eye.The condition results from the leakage of lipoproteins (phospholipids and cholesterol) from limbalcapillaries into the corneal stroma, initiating deposition at the superior and inferior cornea. Overtime, the ring progresses circumferentially, sparing a clear corneal zone adjacent to the limbuscalled the interval of Vogt.The following opacities and rings can resemble arcus senilis:•Kayser- Fleischer (KF) ring: A dark brown ring caused by the deposition of excess copper inDescemet's membrane, classically seen in Wilson's disease. It may also be seen in certain chronic,cholestatic liver conditions such as primary biliary cirrhosis.• Limbus sign: Caused by dystrophic calcification, seen as a \"milky precipitate\" at the corneallimbus. It can sometimes be confused with AS in the elderly population.• Pseudo-gerontoxon: A greyish peri-limbal band of superficial scarring adjacent to a previouslyinflamed segment of the limbus resembling AS, seen in vernal keratoconjunctivitis.The image below depicts the Kayser-Fleischer ring and anterior capsule of the crystalline lens(Sunflower cataract) seen in Wilson's disease.171Solution to Question 9:The described corneal findings, with his classic history of welding less than 12 hours prior topresentation, are suggestive of photophthalmia.Photophthalmia is produced due to exposure to short-wavelength ultraviolet (UV-",
        "B": "rays. Thecornea absorbs the majority of UV light (especially 311 to 290 nm). It results in desquamation ofthe epithelium leading to multiple painful corneal erosions. Causes of of UV keratitis:The symptoms appear characteristically after a latent period of 4-5 hours of exposure toultraviolet light. There is intense burning pain, foreign body sensation, and watering of the eyes.There may be associated marked photophobia and blepharospasm. On slit-lamp examination,corneal epithelium shows a breach in continuity and takes up fluorescein stain.Management comprises cold compresses, lubricant eye drops and bandaging eyes for 24 hourswith antibiotic eye ointment and cycloplegic. Avoid local surface topical anaesthesia. Crooke'sglass is a prophylactic aid consisting of a spectacle lens combined with metallic oxides to absorbultraviolet or infrared rays and should be used by those who are prone to exposure.Note: Photoretinitis and macular burns are often a result of infrared radiation.Artificial causesArc weldingFlash from short-circuits, Damaged metal halide lampsTanning bedsUV germicidal lamps.Natural causesExposure to strong solar radiation at high altitudes especially on snow-covered terrain(snow blindness) Prolonged viewing of a solar eclipse without proper eye protection.172Solution to Question 10:Cryopreservation is used for long-term preservation of cornea, up to 1 year.Solution to Question 11:Staphylococcus epidermidis is the most common cause of infectious keratitis after cornealtransplantation in developing countries.Pneumococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus have been found to be the most common causes ofpost-corneal transplant infections in developed countries.Solution to Question 12:The gold standard technique for assessing corneal thickness is ultrasound pachymetry, whichuses a corneal pachymeter.Measurement of the corneal thickness (pachymetry) indirectly reflects endothelial function. Theaverage central corneal thickness is around 0.5 mm, which gradually increases toward theperiphery to around 0.7 mm. Normally, as a diurnal variation, corneas tend to be slightly thickerjust after a person awakes in the morning.Other options:Option A: Confocal microscopy is an imaging technique that allows in vivo examination of cornealstructures at high magnification and resolution. It is used to assess corneal nerve morphology andcorneal endothelium.Option B: Keratometry measures the anterior corneal curvature and is traditionally performedwith a manual keratometer, also known as an ophthalmometer.Option D: Corneal topography is used to assess the anterior corneal surface, its shape andthickness.The image below shows a corneal pachymeter.173READRECALLPRINT6CO9RESETSolution to Question 13:The investigation shown in the image is corneal topography, and it is used for conditions likekeratoconus, as seen in this clinical scenario.Corneal topography captures the shape of the cornea by projecting concentric rings of light ontoits anterior surface, forming a Placido disc pattern. the reflected light is analyzed with specialisedsoftware to create a detailed map of the corneal curvature.•Uses:• Detection of corneal ectasia, mainly keratoconus• To measure corneal thickness●• Prior to refractive surgery•Sometimes prior to contact lens fittingThe image shows a Placido or Keratoscopic disc which is used for corneal surface assessment.174Solution to Question 14:Keratoconus is a progressive bilateral corneal ectatic disorder. It manifests as characteristiccone-like steepening of the cornea associated with irregular stromal thinning, resulting in acone-like bulge (protrusion) and significant loss of vision.The pathogenesis is not fully known. Several associations have been identified, which include rigidcontact lens wear, chronic eye rubbing, Down's syndrome, atopic disease, Leber's congenitalamaurosis, and connective tissue disease.It is a non-inflammatory disease. With the exception of the significant loss of vision, other classicsigns of inflammation are not usually present. The asymmetrical thinning and the highly irregularcorneal topography often causes significant myopia and irregular astigmatism.Corneal topography is the primary diagnostic tool for KCN detection.Whereas keratoplasty, historically has been the mainstay of treatment for keratoconus, it is nowgenerally reserved for eyes that are unable to achieve functional vision with other surgical ornon-surgical modalities and is only considered only as a last resort, in very advanced disease. It isthe definitive treatment for keratoconus, not the treatment of choice.175Haab'sStriae-CongenitalGlaucomaVogt'sStriae-KeratoconusSolution to Question 15:Vision correction with spectacles with spherical/toric soft contact lenses is suboptimal and onlyapplicable to the early stages of keratoconus, not in the advanced stages.Keratoconus is a progressive, non-inflammatory, bilateral corneal ectasia characterized bycone-like steepening due to irregular stromal thinning. This leads to a conical corneal protrusion,significant vision loss, myopia and irregular astigmatism.The available options for the management of keratoconus are highly dependent on the stage of thedisease and its progression. If the disease is stabilized (no progression), the emphasis is given tocorrecting the vision. If the disease is progressing, the emphasis is on slowing (arresting) theprogression.•Treatment options in moderate-to-advanced keratoconus:Rigid gas-permeable contact lenses and vaulting scleral lenses are the mainstays of visiontreatment for moderate to advanced KCN.
