Thus, any cataract dense enough to impair visionmust be dealt with before this age, and the earliest possible time is preferred.•Bilateral dense cataract- early surgery by 4-6 weeks of age• Unilateral dense cataract or involving visual axis- urgent surgery within daysIntracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) is contraindicated in children.",

      "question": "Detailed ExplanationsThe lens of the eye originates embryonically from the surface ectoderm.Surface ectoderm gives rise to lens, conjunctival and corneal epithelium and epithelial lining oflacrimal glands and tarsal glands.Solution to Question 2:The youngest fibers of the lens are the peripheral part, the cortex.The nucleus of the lens is the central part containing the oldest fibers.The lens fibers are produced by mitosis of the epithelial cells in the pre-equatorial zone. As thelens fibers elongate and the new ones are formed, the older ones are pushed towards the depth ofthe lens so that the youngest fibers are the most superficially located.268Structure of the crystalline lensAnterior capsule.Anterior epithelium.NucleusCortexAdultInfantileFetalEmbryonicMARIOMARROWSolution to Question 3:The primary fibers in the embryonic nucleus of the lens do not form Y-shaped sutures.The image shows bilateral cataracts in the Y-shaped sutures of the lens. These are very slowlyprogressive congenital cataracts and do not require any surgical intervention.•Types of lens nucleus and their age of development:Embryonic nucleus: Innermost nucleus formed at around 1-3 months of gestation•Fetal nucleus: From 3 months of gestation till birth•• Infantile nucleus: From birth to puberty• Adult nucleusAs lens fibers grow anteriorly and posteriorly, a pattern emerges where the ends of the fibersmeet. These patterns of cell association are known as sutures.Y-shaped sutures are recognizable at about 8 weeks of gestation.269Fibres and Sutures of the LensMAAnterior lensepitheliumAnteriorY suture(erect)CortexOMARROWEmbryonalnucleus(not involvedin sutures)PosteriorY suture(inverted)Fetal nucleusSolution to Question 4:The hyaloideo-capsular ligament of Weigert is the attachment of the vitreous to the posteriorcapsule of the lens.It is the annular region (1–2 mm in width and 8–9 mm in diameter) where the vitreous is attachedto the posterior aspect of the lens.Erggelet's or Berger's space is at the centre of the hyaloideo-capsular ligament, a potential spacebetween the vitreous and the lens. The canal of Cloquet arises from this space and coursesposteriorly through the central vitreous, which is the former site of the hyaloid artery in theembryonic vitreous.Posteriorly, Cloquet's canal opens into a funnel-shaped region anterior to the optic disc, whch isknown as the area of Martegiani.Posterior Chamber of EyeCloquet's canalSpace of MartegianiOMARROW270Berger's spaceWeigert'sligamentVitreousbaseSolution to Question 5:The crystalline lens derives its nutrition from the aqueous humor.The lens is an avascular structure. It receives nutrition mostly from the aqueous humor and, tosome extent, from the vitreous humor as well. Glucose is the main energy source. Major intrinsicprotein 26 (MIP 26)/Aquaporin o in the lens is responsible for maintaining transparency bytransporting water and glycerol across the lens.Anti-oxidant mechanisms in the lens:•Reduced glutathione (most important)• Glutathione peroxidase• Superoxide dismutase• Catalase.• Vitamin C, Vitamin E, carotenoids.Solution to Question 6:The lens capsule is the thinnest at the posterior pole, measuring 4 μm.Other options:Option A: At the anterior pole, the thickness of lens capsule is 14 μm.Option C: In the pre-equator region, lens capsule is the thickest, measuring 23 μm.Option D: At the equator, as shown in the illustration below, the thickness is 17 µm.Thickness of the lens capsuleAnterior poleEquator 17 μm-14 μm21 μm21 μm23 μm(thickest)4 μmOMARROW23 μm(thickest)-17 μmEquator271Solution to Question 7:The slide shows the histology of the lens and the structure marked in the subcapsularepithelium. The epithelium of the lens is absent on its posterior surface.The lens epithelium is a single layer of cells on the anterior surface of the lens. There is noepithelium on the posterior surface, as these cells are used up in filling the central cavity of thelens vesicle during the development of the lens. The anterior epithelial lining creates new lensfibers throughout a person's life.OMARROWSubcapsularepitheliumSolution to Question 8:Ascorbate and alpha-tocopherol are maintained in the lens in the reduced, functional stateby glutathione.Glutathione is present in high concentrations in the lens, particularly in the epithelial layer. Oneof its key functions is to maintain protein thiols in their reduced state, which preserves the lenstransparency by preventing the formation of high molecular weight crystalline aggregates andprotects the lens from oxidative stress.The lens is highly prone to photochemical reactions from continuous exposure to ultraviolet rays(295–400 nm), leading to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Its defence relies heavily onsuperoxide dismutase, ascorbate, catalase and glutathione peroxidase.With ageing or cataracts, levels of glutathione and ascorbic acid (in reduced form) significantlydecrease.Solution to Question 9:272The most common cause of cataracts is ageing, specifically senile (age-related) cataract.Important causes of cataract:•••Aging (Most common)Congenital cataract (crystallin gene - CRYAA, CRYAB, CRYGC, CRYGS) (Option",

The two types of senile cataracts are cortical (soft cataract)-75% and nuclear (hardcataract)-25%. In cortical cataract, the cuneiform type (70%) is the most common, and thecupuliform type is the most visually handicapping.Solution to Question 10:The most common type of congenital cataract is the blue-dot cataract.Cataracta-punctata-caerulea, commonly known as blue dot cataract, is a prevalent type ofcongenital cataract. It typically develops during the first two decades of life. This condition ischaracterized by distinctive rounded bluish opacities located in the peripheral region of theadolescent nucleus and the deeper cortical layers of the lens. While these opacities are generallystationary and do not impair vision, larger ones may cause slight visual disturbance.Solution to Question 11:Lamellar or zonular cataract is the most common type of congenital cataract presenting withvisual impairment.The etiology may be either genetic or environmental in origin.• Genetic- familial autosomal-dominant• Environmental form is associated with:• Vitamin D deficiency.HypocalcemiaSometimes, maternal rubella infection contracted between the 7th and 8th week of gestationmay also cause lamellar cataract.The main mass of the lens internal and external to the zone of cataract is clear.273Small linear opacities like spokes of a wheel (riders) may be seen towards the equator.Slit LightDiffusion LightSolution to Question 12:The clinical scenario showing blueberry muffin rash, combined with patent ductus arteriosus in ababy girl, suggests a diagnosis of congenital rubella syndrome, which is typically associated with aprogressive, pearly white nuclear cataract.Ocular effects of rubella:• Microphthalmia• Rubella keratitisAngle-closure glaucoma• Nuclear pearly cataract•Salt and pepper fundus (a most common ocular feature of rubella) due to diffuse chorioretinitis.Solution to Question 13:The image above characteristically depicts a Christmas tree cataract, featuring multiple refractilecolors commonly observed in myotonic dystrophy.Myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by difficulty relaxingskeletal muscles after contraction. The initial symptoms typically manifest during adolescence orearly adulthood.Cataracts are an early and prominent feature in 90% of patients with myotonic dystrophy. Theytypically present as fine, dust-like opacities interspersed with iridescent, polychromatic spots inthe cortical layer beneath the anterior and posterior lens capsule, resembling a Christmas tree.These cataracts may remain stable or progress.274Surgical outcomes are generally favourable.Solution to Question 14:The above image represents an advanced stage of cataract progression characteristic of aMorgagnian hyper-mature cataract.Morgagnian hyper-mature cataracts are characterized by liquefaction of the entire cortex. The lensis converted into a bag of milky fluid. The small, brownish nucleus settles at the bottom, itsposition altering with a change in the position of the head.Senile cataract is the most common type of acquired cataract and is also known as age-relatedcataract. The two types of senile cataracts are cortical (soft cataract)-75% and nuclear (hardcataract)-25%.Cortical cataract is further divided into the cuneiform and cupuliform types.Nuclear cataracts: These may be pigmented due to the deposition of urochrome pigments.
