Treatment is the excision of the adhesionsbetween lid margins. In severe cases where the adhesions involve the angle of the eyes, epithelialgrafts can be used.Other options:Option A: Symblepharon is the adhesion between the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, wherebythe eyelids become adherent to the eyeball.Option C: Blepharophimosis is a congenital anomaly in which the extent of the palpebral fissure isdecreased. It appears contracted at the outer canthus.376Option D: Lagophthalmos is characterized by the inability to close the eyelids voluntarily. It maybe due to a malfunction of the facial nerve.

The disorder is characterized byweakness and fatigability of skeletal muscles where the weakness increases during repeateduse and may improve following rest.Ptosis and diplopia are common initial complaints due to early involvement of the lids andextraocular muscles (EOMs). Of them, Ptosis is a more common manifestation than diplopia.Ptosis in myasthenia gravis is insidious, bilateral, and frequently asymmetrical.Investigations of myasthenia gravis include:• Ice pack test -This tests for a transient improvement of the ptotic eyelid on placing an ice packfor 2 minutes, as the cold inhibits the breakdown of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase.• Tensilon (Edrophonium) test - This tests for a transient improvement in the weakness on•administration of a short-acting anticholinesterase such as edrophonium.Antibody testing - for Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies, MuSK protein antibodies helpssupport a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis.",
