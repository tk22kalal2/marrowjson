      "explanation": "In squint surgery, muscle resection leads to the strengthening of the muscle.The main types of procedure in squint surgery are as follows:• Weakening to decrease the effective strength of action of a muscle.• Recession slackens a muscle by moving it away from its insertion. It can be performed on anymuscle except the superior oblique.• Disinsertion (or myectomy) involves detaching a muscle from its insertion without reattachment.It is most commonly used to weaken an overacting inferior oblique muscle.⚫ Posterior fixation suture: The principle of this (Faden) procedure is to suture the muscle belly tothe sclera posteriorly so as to decrease the pull of the muscle in its field of action without affectingthe eye in the primary position.••Strengthening, to enhance the pull of a muscle.Resection shortens a muscle to enhance its effective pull. It is suitable only for the rectus muscle.Tucking of a muscle or its tendon is usually confined to the enhancement of the action of thesuperior oblique muscle.• Advancement of the muscle nearer to the limbus can be used to enhance the action of apreviously recessed rectus muscle.•Vector adjustment procedures have the primary aim of altering the direction of muscle action.•⚫ Transposition refers to the relocation of one or more extraocular muscles to substitute for theaction of an absent or severely deficient muscle. The most common indication is severe lateralrectus weakness due to acquired palsy of the 6th cranial nerve palsy.",

      "explanation": "ARROMARROWV487Right superior rectus palsy is the cause for the given clinical scenario.The three-step test, also known as the Parks-Bielschowsky three-step test, is a diagnostic test usedto identify which muscle is paralyzed in the case of an acquired hypertropia. This method uses thecover-uncover test, with or without the Maddox rod to measure the amount of deviation indifferent head positions.The three-step test may also be used to diagnose the less common inferior oblique or verticalrectus muscle palsy. It is designed for the diagnosis of a single paretic vertical muscle and isunreliable when there are multiple paretic muscles or in restrictive strabismus. This test may alsohelp in identifying if a superior rectus palsy is true or simulated in a patient with an inhibitionalpalsy of the contralateral antagonist.Using the three-step test in the above clinical scenario:Step 1. Which eye is hypotrophic?The eye hypotrophic in the primary position is the right eye. The paretic muscles can be right eyeelevator or left eye depressor.•Right superior rectus•• Right inferior oblique• Left inferior rectus• Left superior obliqueStep 2. Does the hypotropia increase in the right gaze or left gaze?The hypotropia increases in right gaze.Therefore, the paretic muscle must be either (1) one of the muscles whose primary action iselevating the right eye on the right gaze, or (2) one of the muscles whose primary action isdepressing the left eye in the right gaze. The left inferior oblique and the right superior rectusboth have a primary action of elevation in right gaze. Therefore, one of these muscles could be theparetic muscle. Likewise, the left superior oblique and the right inferior rectus have a primaryaction of depression in the right gaze and could be paretic. But since the left inferior oblique andthe right inferior rectus did not meet step 1, they can be eliminated from the possible pareticmuscles. This leaves us:• Left superior oblique•• Right superior rectusStep 3. Does the hypotropia increase in the right head tilt or left head tilt?The hypotropia increases in the right head tilt. If the deviation increases on right head tilt anddecreases on left head tilt, as it does in this example patient, then the right superior rectus isimplicated as the paretic culprit.488",
