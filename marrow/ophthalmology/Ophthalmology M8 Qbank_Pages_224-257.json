Othercauses include trauma such as cyclodialysis of the uvea (Option B), penetrating injury (Option C),chronic uveitis, retinal detachment, and other systemic causes such as dehydration, uncontrolleddiabetes, uremia, and treatment with hyperosmotic agents. They usually cause bilateral hypotonicmaculopathy.Suprachoroidal hemorrhage is a bleed into the suprachoroidal space that results from the ruptureof the posterior ciliary artery. When the bleed is severe it causes extrusion of intraocular contentsthat is termed as expulsive hemorrhage. It is a rare but dreaded complication of thephacoemulsification procedure. Signs seen in suprachoroidal hemorrhage are:• Progressive increase in intraocular pressure• Prolapse of iris241•• Loss or partial obscuration of the red reflex• In severe cases there can be extrusion of the posterior segment contents into the anteriorchamber and through the incision such as vitreous extrusionImmediate treatment involves rapid closure of the incision followed by administration ofIOP-lowering medications such as oral acetazolamide and topical or systemic steroids to reduceinflammation.

      "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis based on the given scenario is Stargardt's disease.Stargardt's disease also known as Stargardt macular dystrophy or fundus flavimaculatus is themost common macular dystrophy. It most commonly is inherited in an autosomal-recessivemanner caused by a mutation on an adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABCA4) gene.Characterized by macular \"pisciform\" flecks that accumulate at the level of the retinal pigmentepithelium (RPE), sometimes resulting in central macular atrophy early in life. Patients develop amacula with a “beaten bronze\" appearance caused by atrophic changes in the RPE. In addition, a\"dark\" or \"silent\" choroid is seen on the fluorescein angiography that appears as a prominentretinal circulation against hypofluorescent choroid.The electroretinogram (ERG) and electro-oculography (EOG) are normal early in the disease butmay be reduced in more advanced cases. Of note, the ERG findings do not directly correlate withclinical findings.There is no known proven treatment for this disease.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Silent/Dark choroid on FFA is a feature of Stargardt's disease. The classic feature of 'silent choroid'is due to the masking of background choroidal fluorescence by lipofuscin deposits in thesubretinal space.Stargardt disease constitutes the most common type of macular dystrophy. It has mutations in aphotoreceptor cell-specific ATP-binding cassette gene (ABC4) that is usually inherited in anautosomal recessive manner. The disease usually starts in the juvenile group with progressivecentral vision loss and color vision loss that occurs due to the atrophy of the macular retinalpigment epithelium with an accumulation of discrete pisciform flecks of lipofuscin.Signs of Stargardt's disease:• Beaten bronze appearance of the macula that is caused by the atrophic changes in the RPE.• Silent/Dark choroid on FFA.• Visual field testing shows central vision loss.• The electroretinogram (ERG) is normal early in the disease but may be reduced in moreadvanced cases.Fundus flavimaculatus is genetically considered to be a part of the same spectrum as Stargardt'sdisease with late onset i.e. usually after 40 years of age.250Other options:Option B: Best's disease also known as vitelliform macular dystrophy is an autosomal dominantmacular dystrophy in which lipofuscin accumulates in the central macula, causing progressivecentral vision loss.

      "question": "Detailed ExplanationsThe given clinical scenario with a characteristic smoke stack pattern on FFA is suggestive of adiagnosis of central serous retinopathy. In CSR, the outer blood-retinal barrier is disrupted.CSR is the serous detachment of the neurosensory retina with focal and multifocal areas ofleakage at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), mainly affecting the macular area.That is why the patient who is usually a young male presents with macular symptoms such asblurring of central vision, metamorphopsia.The blood-retina barrier (BRB) is composed of inner and outer barriers. The outer BRB refers tothe barrier formed at the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell layer and regulates the movement ofsolutes and nutrients from the choroid to the sub-retinal space. By contrast, the inner BRB,similar to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is located in the inner retinal microvasculature andcomprises the microvascular endothelium, which lines these vessels.The image given below shows the smoke-stack pattern seen in CSR.Amsler grid is used in detecting maculopathy.Uses:• Assess macular function• Evaluate the visual field of 10°• Good for follow-up in CSRThe image below shows Amsler's grid.DAILY ROUNDS237Amsler GridOMARROWSolution to Question 2:Fluid accumulation in central serous retinopathy (CSR) is in the subretinal space due to abnormalpermeability of the choriocapillaris.The image depicts optical coherence tomography showing fluid accumulation in the subretinalspace, with shallow retinal detachment.272Solution to Question 3:The above clinical scenario and the fundal image depicting focal fundal detachment are suggestiveof central serous retinopathy. An enlarging inkblot pattern or smoke stack pattern is seen in FFA.238Central serous retinopathy refers to the spontaneous serous detachment of the neurosensoryretina in the macular region.

They are composed of lipid, amyloid,complement factors, and associated cellular components.There are two types of ARMD:• Dry (non-exudative, non-neovascular) ARMD is the most common form, comprising around90% of the diagnosed cases. Initially characterized by macular Drusens, which later progress togeographical atrophy. Geographic atrophy (GA) is the advanced stage of dry ARMD. Antioxidantslike the AREDS2 supplements have proven effective.• Wet (exudative, neovascular) ARMD is much less common than the dry type, but it is associatedwith more rapid progression to advanced sight loss.Clinical classification:CategoryDefinition(based on the presence of lesionswithin two discdiametersof the fovea in either eye)No apparentage-relatedchang No drusenNo AMD pigmentaesNormal age-relatedchangesEarlyARMDIntermediateARMDLateARMDry abnormalitiesOnly drusenNo AMD pigmentary abnormalitiesMedium Drusen(>63 um but<125 μm)No AMD pigmentary abnormalitiesLarge Drusen(>125 µm)AnyARMD pigmentaryabnormalitiesNeovascular ARMDand/oranygeographic atrophySolution to Question 5:Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) is primarily indicated in an occult choroidal neovascularmembrane (CNVM).ICGA is used to visualize the choroidal vasculature.Its main use is to differentiate between classic and occult CNVM when the clinical picture is notclear.Solution to Question 6:Intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is used as the treatmentof wet age-related macular degeneration (ARMD).240Wet ARMD is characterized by retinal pigment epithelial detachment and choroidal/subretinalneovascularization.Treatment of ARMD depends on the location of the choroidal neovascularization membrane:• For extrafoveal membrane Laser photocoagulation•••-For subfoveal and juxta foveal membranes, treatment options are as follows:• Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agentsPhotodynamic therapy - the dye used is verteporfin followed by exposure to light from a diode• Transpupillary thermotherapySolution to Question 7:The image is that of fluorescein angiography showing the \"flower petal pattern,\" which is seen incystoid macular edema (CME). The characteristic flower-petal appearance is due to theaccumulation of dye in the outer plexiform layer and inner nuclear layer at the maculaThe accumulation of fluid in the outer plexiform layer and the inner nuclear layer leads to retinalthickening at macula and loss of foveal depression, formation of cystic spaces (honey-combmacula). Risk factors include retinitis pigmentosa, uveitis, niacin, PGE2 analogues, epinephrine inaphakia, diabetic retinopathy, retinal venous occlusion and Irvin-Gass syndrome (CMEpost-cataract surgery).Symptoms may include blurring of vision, distortion, and micropsia.Therapeutic approaches for treating CME depend on the underlying etiology. This includessteroids, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, anti-VEGF agents, PPV for associated vitreomaculartraction.Solution to Question 8:Suprachoroidal hemorrhage will not cause hypotonic maculopathy in this patient.Maculopathy is common in eyes developing hypotony, which is defined as IOP &lt;6 mmHg. Themost common cause is excessive drainage following glaucoma filtration surgery (Option D). Othercauses include trauma such as cyclodialysis of the uvea (Option",
        "B": ", penetrating injury (Option",
        "C": ",chronic uveitis, retinal detachment, and other systemic causes such as dehydration, uncontrolleddiabetes, uremia, and treatment with hyperosmotic agents. They usually cause bilateral hypotonicmaculopathy.Suprachoroidal hemorrhage is a bleed into the suprachoroidal space that results from the ruptureof the posterior ciliary artery. When the bleed is severe it causes extrusion of intraocular contentsthat is termed as expulsive hemorrhage. It is a rare but dreaded complication of thephacoemulsification procedure. Signs seen in suprachoroidal hemorrhage are:• Progressive increase in intraocular pressure• Prolapse of iris241•• Loss or partial obscuration of the red reflex• In severe cases there can be extrusion of the posterior segment contents into the anteriorchamber and through the incision such as vitreous extrusionImmediate treatment involves rapid closure of the incision followed by administration ofIOP-lowering medications such as oral acetazolamide and topical or systemic steroids to reduceinflammation. Standard post-operative antibiotics can be added in these patients.Solution to Question 9:The investigation shown in the image is an autofluorescence showing bull's eye maculopathy.Hydroxychloroquine, which is generally used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, toxicitycauses bull's eye maculopathy. Chloroquine binds to melanin in the retinal pigment epithelium,causing cytotoxic effects. RPE atrophy occurs in the macula, resulting in dark areas on theautofluorescence image.Other causes of Bull's eye maculopathy include chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, congenital conedystrophy, juvenile X-linked retinoschisis, and juvenile Batten's disease.Fundus autofluorescence is a non-invasive imaging modality. It reflects the morphologicalchanges associated with the metabolism of lipofuscin and does not require the injection of anyfluorescent dye.A fundus image of bull's eye maculopathy is shown below:The following image shows the difference between fundus autofluorescence and fluorescenceangiography242Fundus autofluorescenceFundus Fluorescein AngiographyOther ocular effects of chloroquine include:• Chloroquine keratopathy-vortex keratopathy•••Ocular palsy, ptosisElectroretinographic depression• Optic neuritis• Posterior subcapsular cataractSolution to Question 10:\"a\" wave in an electroretinogram (ERG) represents rods and cones.Electroretinography is used to evaluate retinal functions by examining the electrical response to alight stimulus.Electroretinograms (ERGS) show the amplitudes of currents that flow within the eye followingexposure to a point of light. The amplitudes are analyzed into waves, which are composed of theresponses of neuronal, glial, and retinal pigment epithelial cells.ERG:•The a-wave originates from photoreceptors (rods and cones)• The b-wave originates from Muller and bipolar cells, but is directly dependant on photoreceptors•The c-wave originates from retinal pigment epithelial cells and retinal glial cells•Oscillatory potentials (OPS) originate in the inner retinaScotopic ERGs are used to evaluate responses starting from rod photoreceptors exposed toflash-light in darkness, and photopic ERGS are used to evaluate responses starting from conephotoreceptors exposed to flash-light under constant light exposure.243Solution to Question 11:Mid-periphery of the retina has the highest concentration of rods.The following table lists the differences between rods and conesPropertyNumberLocationFunctionDysfunction symptomsRodsMost numerous (120 million)Mid-peripheral retinaNight visionMotion sensePeripheral visionNyctalopia Peripheral field losSConesFar fewer in number (6 million)FoveaDay visionColour visionCentral and fine visionPoor central vision DyschromatopsiaHemeralopiaSolution to Question 12:The gene for rhodopsin is located at 3q22.1Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a dystrophy of rods and cones, with rods being primarily affected.
