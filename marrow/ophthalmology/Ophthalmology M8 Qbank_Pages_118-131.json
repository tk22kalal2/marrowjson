      "question": "A patient sustained a severe blow to the right eye from the lateral side during a fistfight. The eyeball is soft to touch and a rupture of the sclera is suspected. What is the least likely site of rupture?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The lateral limbus is the least likely site to be involved in a traumatic scleral rupture. Traumatic scleral rupture, or globe rupture, occurs after blunt-force trauma. It usually occurs due to the compression force of the trauma. It therefore likely occurs at the insertion of rectus muscles, at the equator, or in an area parallel to the limbus opposite from the site of the impact. Rupture at the site of trauma, in this case lateral limbus, is rare. The major signs of scleral rupture are conjunctival edema and subconjunctival hemorrhage, hyphema, ocular hypotony, impairment or dislocation of the lens, vitreous hemorrhage, and retinal detachment.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "High intraocular pressure leads to the thinning of the outer tunics of the eyeball such ascornea and sclera, thereby resulting in their ectasia (bulging) which is known asstaphyloma. Ciliary and equatorial staphylomas are most commonly associated with glaucoma.Staphyloma is an abnormal protrusion of the uveal tissue through a weak and thin portion ofthe cornea or sclera. So, staphyloma is lined internally by uveal tissue and externally by weakcornea or sclera.Types of Staphyloma:TypesAnterior staphylomaPathologyDue to bulging of the pseudocornea, internally lined by the iris & externally by the newly formed epithelium.Intercalary staphylom Due to bulging of weakened 1aCiliary staphylomaEquatorial staphylomaPosterior staphylomaimbal tissue at the limbus, internally lined by the root of iris & the anterior most part ofthe ciliary bodyDue to bulging of the weakened sclera, internally lined bythe ciliary body, can extend up to 8mm behind the limbusDue to bulging of sclera withchoroidal lining, seen around14 mm behind the limbus, inthe equatorial regionDue to bulging of sclera linedby the choroid, seen behindthe equatorCausesSloughing corneal ulcerDevelopmental glaucomaSecondary angle closure glaucomaHealing of perforating injuryPeripheral corneal ulcer.Scleritis End stage glaucomaPerforating injuriesScleritisChronic uncontrolledglaucomaScleral degeneration in pathological myopiaPosterior scleritis Pathologica1 myopiaPerforating injuriesAnterior-Anatomical types of staphylomaOMARROW125-IntercalaryCiliaryEquatorialPosteriorKeratoconus (Option A) is a progressive bilateral corneal ectatic disorder due to defectivesynthesis of mucopolysaccharide and collagen tissue.

It typically occurs in elderly women withrheumatoid arthritis (systemic disease). There is ischemia and necrosis of the sclera; however,there is no inflammation.
