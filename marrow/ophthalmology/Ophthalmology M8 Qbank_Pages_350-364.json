      "explanation": "In acute retinal necrosis, the posterior pole is typically spared until late.Acute retinal necrosis (ARN) occurs in immunocompetent individuals. It is a severe posterioruveitis causing retinal necrosis. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus is the most common cause of acuteretinal necrosis in adults. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) are thecommonest causes of acute retinal necrosis in children.Patients present with confluent peripheral necrotizing retinitis, retinal arteritis withvaso-occlusion, and vitritis. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachments are common due to retinalthinning from large areas of necrosis. The posterior pole is involved only in the later stages.Aciclovir is administered intravenously (10 mg/kg, every 8 hours) for 10-14 days, and then orally(800 mg, five times daily) for 6-12 weeks. Oral valaciclovir or famciclovir may be substituted fororal aciclovir, with similar outcomes but better tolerability. Intravitreal ganciclovir or foscarnetmay enhance the prognosis. Systemic steroids may be started 24 hours after the initiation ofantiviral therapy, especially in severe cases. Laser retinopexy is performed around necrotic areas.Progressive outer retinal necrosis is a manifestation of HSV or varicella zoster virus (VZV) thatoccurs in immunocompromised individuals.

They may develop visual impairment if retinalvascular disease (vasculitis and occlusion) occurs.Other options:Option A: HLA-B27 is associated with Reiter's syndrome.Option B: HLA DR1 and HLA-DR4 are associated with Vogt-Koyanagi-Haradas disease.Option D: HLA Bw54 is associated with Possner-Scholssman syndrome.Note: The association between HLA-A29 and birdshot retinochoroidopathy is the most consistentof any medical disorder. Approximately 95% of patients with birdshot retinochoroidopathy areHLA-A29-positive.Solution to Question 4:The image shows the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) colonies on theLowenstein-Jensen medium. In tuberculosis (TB), granulomatous panuveitis is the most common357ocular feature.Ocular TB commonly occurs due to hematogenous spread from pulmonary TB. It can havemultiple presentations like lupus vulgaris of eyelid, tubercular conjunctivitis, interstitial keratitis,granulomatous uveitis and endophthalmitis. Phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis is caused by ahypersensitivity reaction to the MTB antigen.Treatment of granulomatous panuveitis is anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) plus steroids.Solution to Question 5:Salt and pepper fundus is not seen in tuberculosis.Salt and pepper fundus is seen when there are multiple small black and white spots present on theretina. It is also known as pseudo-retinitis pigmentosa. Its causes include congenital syphilis,rubella, Refsum's disease, carriers of albinism, Leber's congenital amaurosis and retinitispigmentosa sine pigmentosa.Solution to Question 6:Dry, itchy eyes, blurred vision, sensitivity to light with candle wax dripping on fundusexamination points to a diagnosis of sarcoidosis.Sarcoidosis is a chronic granulomatous multi-system disease. Ocular inflammation occurs in25-70% of sarcoid patients, which includes uveitis, conjuctival and lacrimal gland involvement.Chronic granulomatous panuveitis may be seen. Anterior uveitis is the most commonmanifestation.In anterior uveitis due to sarcoidosis, \"mutton fat\" keratic precipitates (KPS) and/or smallgranulomatous KPs with iris nodules (Koeppe and/or Busacca) are seen. Trabecular meshwork(TM) nodules and/or tent-shaped peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) is also seen.358In intermediate uveitis, vitreous cells with snowbanking and snowball opacities/string of pearlappearance are seen. Posterior uveitis presents with candle-wax dripping (thick venous sheathingand periphlebitis), pre-retinal nodules (Lander's sign), choroidal granulomata and sarcoidinfiltration. Other ocular features seen are interstitial keratitis and band-shapedkeratopathy. Steroids are the mainstay of treatment in sarcoidosis.Solution to Question 7:Microangiopathy is the most common ocular feature of HIV infection.Microangiopathy of the retina in HIV consists of the hemorrhages, micro-aneurysms andcotton-wool spots or soft exudates (axonal debris). Cotton wool spots are the most commonfinding of HIV retinopathy.HIV leads to multiple opportunistic infections of the eye like cytomegalovirus (CMV) - mostcommon cause of posterior uveitis in HIV - toxoplasmosis, Pneumocystis carinii and herpeszoster. These infections present as keratitis, choroiditis, retinitis and endophthalmitis.The most common ocular adverse effect in patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy(HAART) is immune recovery uveitis (IRU). It is a non-granulomatous uveitis (usually anterioruveitis and vitritis) associated with a paradoxical or exaggerated reactivation of the immunesystem and an increase in intraocular inflammation. It occurs after receiving HAART for CMVchorioretinitis. Visual complications of IRU include cataract, cystoid macular edema (CME),glaucoma, and epiretinal membrane formation.Solution to Question 8:Painless blurring of vision in an HIV positive patient with \"sauce and cheese\" or \"pizza pie\"retinopathy (shown in the image) is characteristic of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis.359CMV retinitis is the most common ocular opportunistic infection in patients with HIV. It is oftenasymptomatic and can be classified as central or peripheral CMV retinitis. Central CMV retinitis ischaracterised by dense, white areas of retinal necrosis and retinal hemorrhage in the areas ofnecrosis pizza pie or sauce and cheese appearance.-Peripheral CMV retinitis is less demarcated. The infection spreads along the vascular arcades in abrush fire-like fashion.Solution to Question 9:An HIV-positive patient with CD4+ count of 35/μL presenting with decreased visual acuity,floaters and pizza pie retinitis (dense, white areas of retinal necrosis with interspersed areas ofretinal hemorrhage) likely has CMV retinitis. The most rapid and accurate method to diagnosecytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis is viral nucleic acid detection in the intraocular fluid.CMV retinitis is an opportunistic infection seen in HIV patients with a CD4+ count less than50/μL. Patients present with reduced vision due to macular involvement and floaters due tovitritis. One eye is usually affected initially. Retinitis is seen. Frosted branch angiitis (FBA), whichis marked vascular sheathing that occurs in about 6% patients, may be seen. Cataract is commonlate-stage manifestation of CMV retinitis.Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is the mainstay of management, restoring thepatient's innate ability to suppress CMV activity. Valganciclovir is a prodrug of ganciclovir that istaken orally. Ganciclovir slow-release intravitreal implant can also be used.Screening of patients with low CD4+ counts:• 3-monthly, if &lt;50/µl• 6-monthly, if 50-100/μl• Yearly, if &gt;100/μlSolution to Question 10:Monocular iritis, severe vitritis with a focal necrotic lesion on the macula is a classical descriptionof ocular toxoplasmosis.Ocular toxoplasmosis is caused by Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate intracellular protozoan. Itcauses severe recurrent attacks of posterior uveitis in adults, due to reactivation at previouslyinactive cyst-containing scars. A single inflammatory focus of fluffy white retinitis orretinochoroiditis associated with a pigmented scar (\"satellite lesion\") is typical. \"Headlight in thefog\" is the classic description of a white retinal inflammatory nidus viewed throughvitritis. \"Spill-over\" anterior uveitis is common.Treatment:• Prednisolone (1 mg/kg) is given initially and tapered according to clinical response.Pyrimethamine is administered as a loading dose of 75-100 mg for 1-2 days followed by 25-50•mg daily for 4 weeks in combination with oral folinic (not folic) acid 5 mg three times a week to360retard thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and folate deficiency.• Sulfadiazine 1 g four times daily for 3-4 weeks is usually given in combination withpyrimethamine.•Intravitreal therapy with clindamycin (1 mg) and dexamethasone (400 µg) may be as effective astriple therapy in reactivated infection.The image shows the characteristic \"headlight in the fog\" appearance:Solution to Question 11:The \"headlight in fog\" appearance is seen in toxoplasmosis.Ocular toxoplasmosis presents with iridocyclitis, which can be granulomatous ornon-granulomatous. There is focal superficial necrotizing retinochoroiditis along with vitritis,which gives the \"headlight in fog\" appearance (image). Fundoscopy shows deep retinitis andpapillitis with granulomas. Old choroid lesions of toxoplasmosis are punched-out lesions withpigmented borders.The treatment of choice for ocular toxoplasmosis is triple therapy with systemic steroids,pyrimethamine, and sulfadiazine. Clindamycin is also used.361Solution to Question 12:In acute retinal necrosis, the posterior pole is typically spared until late.Acute retinal necrosis (ARN) occurs in immunocompetent individuals. It is a severe posterioruveitis causing retinal necrosis. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus is the most common cause of acuteretinal necrosis in adults. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) are thecommonest causes of acute retinal necrosis in children.Patients present with confluent peripheral necrotizing retinitis, retinal arteritis withvaso-occlusion, and vitritis. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachments are common due to retinalthinning from large areas of necrosis. The posterior pole is involved only in the later stages.Aciclovir is administered intravenously (10 mg/kg, every 8 hours) for 10-14 days, and then orally(800 mg, five times daily) for 6-12 weeks. Oral valaciclovir or famciclovir may be substituted fororal aciclovir, with similar outcomes but better tolerability. Intravitreal ganciclovir or foscarnetmay enhance the prognosis. Systemic steroids may be started 24 hours after the initiation ofantiviral therapy, especially in severe cases. Laser retinopexy is performed around necrotic areas.Progressive outer retinal necrosis is a manifestation of HSV or varicella zoster virus (VZV) thatoccurs in immunocompromised individuals. It may begin at the posterior pole or the periphery. Ithas a rapid course and is not generally associated with vasculitis.Solution to Question 13:Painful decrease in vision following cataract surgery 6 months ago with granulomatous anterioruveitis, hypopyon, vitritis and a white plaque on the posterior lens capsule suggests a diagnosis ofdelayed-onset postoperative endophthalmitis caused by Propionibacterium acnes. The bestmanagement for the above clinical scenario would be vitrectomy and posterior capsulotomy,followed by intravitreal injection of vancomycin.362Delayed-onset endophthalmitis, a complication of cataract surgery, has a slow course andpanuveitis like picture. There is low grade anterior chamber inflammation and vitritis. Whencaused by P. acnes, it typically presents from 3 months to 2 years after surgery with acharacteristic white retro-lenticular plaque on the posterior capsule of lens. Endophthalmitiscaused by Candida occurs within 3 months of surgery.Management includes anterior vitrectomy, IOL explantation, posterior capsulectomy, intravitrealvancomycin, and a scleral-fixated intraocular lens (IOL) implantation.Solution to Question 14:Sympathetic ophthalmia is seen after a penetrating trauma.Sympathetic ophthalmia is a bilateral granulomatous panuveitis seen after a penetrating traumaor less frequently, following intraocular surgery, usually multiple vitreoretinal procedures.Patients present between 2 weeks and 3 months after initial injury.The earliest symptom is blurred near vision in the sympathizing (uninjure",
        "D": "eye. The earliest signis a retrolental flare in the sympathizing eye. Anterior uveitis develops in both eyes. The fundusshows multifocal choroidal infiltrates in the mid-periphery. Sub-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)infiltrates corresponding to Dalen-Fuchs nodules (image) (a granuloma situated between Bruchmembrane and the RPE) are also present.Steroids are the basis of treatment. High-dose oral prednisolone is given for several months.Immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, and methotrexate can be used inresistant cases or as steroid-sparing agents. Enucleation of a severely injured eye with no visualpotential within 2 weeks of injury prevents the occurrence of sympathetic ophthalmia.Solution to"
