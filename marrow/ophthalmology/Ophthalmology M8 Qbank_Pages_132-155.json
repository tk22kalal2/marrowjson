      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The hydration level and transparency of the cornea is maintained mainly by the endothelialcells of the cornea.The endothelium possesses Na+/K+ ATPase, which keeps the corneal stroma in a relativelydehydrated state. This helps maintain corneal transparency. Endothelial cells decrease in numberwith age. If the cornea becomes overhydrated, it begins to scatter light and gradually begins tolose its transparencyOther factors contributing to the transparency of the cornea are as follows:•Regular arrangement of corneal lamellae (Maurice theory)•The peculiar refractive index of corneal lamellae (Goldmann theory)•• Avascularity of the cornea•A balance between the intraocular pressure (IOP) and swelling pressureThe different layers of the cornea are as follows:⚫ Epithelium• Bowman's membrane•Stroma (substantia propria)• Dua's layer (pre-Descemet's layer)• Descemet's membrane• Endothelium",

Donor tissues are screened for stress lines, mechanical trauma, scarring, cornealedema, and infiltrates that could indicate poor tissue quality. They are further evaluated forthickness and endothelial cell density (a surrogate for endothelial function) which are importantdeterminants of successful graft transplantation.Endothelial cell density (ECD) and morphology are assessed using a specular microscope or by abright-field/phase-contrast light microscope.Note: The number of cells decreases at about 0.6% per year, and the neighboring cells enlarge tofill the space as the cells cannot regenerate. At a density of about 500 cells/mm2, corneal edemadevelops and transparency is impaired. This is known as critical endothelial density.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical vignette of the patient presenting with pain, photophobia, and redness of theeye following trauma by a vegetative matter is suggestive of a fungal corneal ulcer.Fungal corneal ulcer also known as mycotic keratitis is usually caused by trauma from vegetativematter such as branches of trees, leaves and animal tails. Injudicious use of topical steroids andantibiotics increases the predisposition to develop secondary fungal keratitis.Mycotic keratitis can be caused by• Filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus and Fusarium• Yeasts such as Candida and cryptococcus•Dimorphic fungi such as Histoplasma and BlastomycesTypically in fungal corneal ulcers, the signs are more prominent than the symptoms. Thesymptoms of fungal keratitis are similar to that of bacterial ulcers which include pain,lacrimation, photophobia, blurred vision, and redness of the eyes.146A typical fungal ulcer has the following signs:•Greyish white looking dry corneal ulcer with rolled out margin.•⚫ Feathery finger-like extensions into the corneal stroma under intact epitheliumWessley ring which is a sterile immune ring that occurs due to the deposition of immunecomplexes•Multiple small satellite lesions around the ulcer• Hypopyon: The hypopyon in fungal ulcer is immobile and unsterile unlike bacterial ulcer (sterilehypopyon)• Perforation is rare•Corneal vascularization is usually absent.A diagnosis of fungal ulcer is made by a typical history of trauma with vegetative matter followedby clinical examination and KOH mount or SDA agar cultures from corneal scrappings.The image below depicts a fungal corneal ulcer with the arrowhead indicating a satellite lesion.DAILYROUNDSOther options:Option A: Anterior uveitis is the inflammation of the uveal tissue from the iris up to the parsplicata of the ciliary body. Infectious uveitis can be caused by the exogenous entry of theorganisms following penetrating injuries, perforation of corneal ulcer, and post-intaocularoperations.Acute anterior uveitis presents with symptoms of pain, photophobia, lacrimation, blurring ofvision and redness of the eye. Signs of anterior uveitis include:•-Aqueous flare It is the earliest sign of acute anterior uveitis, it occurs following the leakage ofprotein particles into the aqueous humor.• Keratic precipitates(KP) - These are pathognomonic for anterior uveitis. They are proteinaceouscellular deposits at the back of the cornea arranged in a triangular fashion. These include muttonfat KP's as seen in granulomatous uveitis and granular KP's of non granulomatous uveitis.147• Iris nodules: typically occur in granulomatous uveitis. Koppe's nodules are at the pupillaryborder and Busacca's nodules are situated near the collarette.Option C: Conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva of which the bacterialconjunctivitis is the most common. Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is characterized by markedconjunctival hyperemia, swelling of the conjunctiva (chemosis), edematous eyelids, stickingtogether of lid margins and mucopurulent discharge from the eye.The image shows a patient with bacterial conjunctivitis.Option D: Corneal laceration: Partial corneal laceration or lamellar corneal laceration occurs froma blunt trauma and is treated by patching and antibiotics.",

The epitheliumand endothelium are not affected. Scarring due to stromal inflammation and vascularization, ininterstitial keratitis, can result in decreased vision.Interstitial keratitis (IK) is a common endpoint of any keratitis that predominantly involves thecorneal stroma. So there is a wide range of potential etiologies.Treatment for IK typically involves the use of topical corticosteroids, as well as appropriatesystemic medications for the associated systemic disease.Immune-mediated etiologiesCogan syndrome:Interstitialkeratitis + deafness + vertigoSarcoidosis Mycosis fungoideSInfectious etiologiesBacterial causes:Syphilis; Lyme diseaseTuberculosis; Leprosy Brucellosis; Leptospirosis.Viral causes: Herpes simplex (HSV), Herpes zoster (VZV) Epstein-Barr (EBV), mumps, rubella (measles)influenza, andvacciniaParasitic causes:leishmaniasisonchocerciasistrypanosomiasisplasmodiumacanthamoeba152",

Because these cells are terminallydifferentiated cells, they do not divide, and when they die, the remaining cells have to stretch tocover more area, resulting in polymegathism and pleomorphism.Taking an endothelial cell count can be helpful before taking patients up for cataract or refractivesurgery so that any potential endothelial dysfunction or thinning is recognized before they havethe surgical intervention.",
