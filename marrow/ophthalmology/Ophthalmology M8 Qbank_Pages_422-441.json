Oral, intravenous or orbital steroidinjections can be used depending upon patient indications. (Option B)•Radiotherapy- Orbital radiation given in a dose of 2000 rads over 10-14 days can be consideredin cases where steroids are ineffective/ contraindicated. It is contraindicated in cases of extensivethyroid eye disease as it can worsen it. (Option A)• Teprotumumab (IGF-1R inhibitor)- is used for persistent, corticosteroid-resistant disease ornon-response to first-line treatment. It is effective in reducing proptosis and clinical activity inpatients.(B) Surgical management:• Orbital decompression- It may be required for an acutely progressive optic neuropathy and/orexposure keratitis, in patients not responding to aggressive steroid therapy. (Option D)• Extraocular muscle surgery- Inferior rectus recession is the most commonly performed surgery.These should be performed after the orbital decompression since decompression may alterextraocular motility. Extraocular muscle surgery helps in achieving a binocular single vision in theprimary gaze and reading position.•• Eyelid surgery- This is done to correct eyelid retraction. Various surgeries that can be performedare mullerectomy, levator recession/ disinsertion, scleral grafts with LPS recession, recession oflower eyelid retractors, and blepharoplasty.",

      "explanation": "The patient presents with acute ophthalmoplegia with the involvement of ophthalmic division oftrigeminal nerve that responds promptly to steroid therapy. The most likely diagnosis isTolosa-Hunt syndrome.It is an idiopathic, sterile inflammation that primarily affects the cavernous sinus. It ischaracterized by painful acute ophthalmoplegia with or without the involvement of the optic nerveand the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve.The pain is described as gnawing or boring and may precede ophthalmoplegia.The inflammation and pain in patients typically responds rapidly and dramatically tocorticosteroid therapy. However, it is a diagnosis of exclusion.",

It is a unilateral eyecondition.Clinically, it manifests as painful ophthalmoplegia and depending on the extent of involvement, itmay present as superior orbital fissure syndrome or orbital apex syndrome.Superior orbital fissure syndrome is characterized by the following:•• Pain, typically labeled as retro-orbital acheSensory loss/disturbances in the distribution of the ophthalmic division of the 5th cranial nerve• Ipsilateral ophthalmoplegia due to the involvement of the 3rd, 4th, and 6th cranial nerveinvolvement• Ptosis, due to 3rd nerve paralysisOrbital apex syndrome includes the following:• Features of superior orbital fissure syndrome described above•• Features of optic nerve involvement, i.e., early visual loss and afferent pupillary defect.441",
