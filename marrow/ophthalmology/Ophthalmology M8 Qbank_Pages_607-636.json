      "explanation": "Tonopen is used for measuring intraocular pressure (IOP) in a scarred cornea.It is a hand-held electronic contact tonometer (a modified version of the older Mackay-Margtonometer). Besides portability, its main advantage is the ability to measure IOP reasonablyaccurately in eyes with distorted or edematous corneas and through a soft contact lens.Types of tonometry:•• Indentation tonometry- Reading depends on scleral rigidity, e.g., Schiotz tonometer625•Applanation tonometry- Based on the amount of force needed to flatten or applanate a knownarea of the cornea, Imbert-Fick principle. This is further divided into two types -• Fixed force: IOP is proportional to the area, e.g., Maklakov, Barraquer• Fixed area and variable force: IOP is proportional to force. The most reliable is Goldmann.• Self-measurement: Rebound• Non-contact type: Pulse Air, Air-Puff• Irregular cornea: Tonopen, Mackay-MargRecent tonometers:• Pascals tonometer (dynamic contour tonometry [DCT]): Contact; used for post-LASIK IOPmeasurement.• Reichert Ocular Response AnalyzerⓇ: Non-contactNote: Tonography is a non-invasive technique for determining the facility of aqueous outflow.The image given below shows fluorescein-stained semicircular mires.Mires of the applanation tonometerMPerfect alignment of miresNot aligned.
