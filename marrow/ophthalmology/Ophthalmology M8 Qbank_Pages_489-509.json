      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of pituitary apoplexy in pregnancy This acute onset eventis almost always associated with compression at the level of optic chiasma causing heteronymoushemianopia (bitemporal hemianopia).Pituitary apoplexy results from hemorrhagic infarction of a pre-existing pituitary adenoma orwithin a physiologically enlarged gland, which is well documented in pregnancy.The nasal fibers of each retina cross through the chiasma. Slow-growing microadenomascompress lower nasal optic fibers causing superior temporal quadrantanopia initially, beforeprogressing to bitemporal hemianopia. However, an abrupt infarction or hemorrhage of apre-existing pituitary adenoma will lead to rapid progression of the visual defect.Heteronymous hemianopia is the loss of half of the visual field on different sides in both eyes. It isseparated into two categories:• Binasal hemianopia - the loss of the fields surrounding the nose•Bitemporal hemianopia - the loss of the fields closest to the temples.Common causes of bitemporal hemianopia due to central chiasmal lesions are as follows:•Suprasellar aneurysms• Tumors of the pituitary gland497•Craniopharyngioma• Suprasellar meningioma•Glioma of the third ventricleOther visual defects according to the site of the lesion are as follows:Visual Pathway Lesions – Optic NerveHead to Optic TractOptic Nerve Head (Unilateral)Big blind spotLeftTemporalNanalOptic Nerve (Unilateral)RightTunnel VisionVisualOptiochiasm15LateralgenioutatenucleuANVisual cortex area 170Inner Optic Nerve (Unilateral)Central ScotomaWhole Optic Nerve (Unilateral)Unilateral BlindnessProximal part of Optic NerveJunctionalScotomaCentral Chiasma (Bilateral)Bitemporal Hemianopia.Carliest Pituitary AdenomaBilateral TemporalSuperior QuadrantanopiaEarliest CraniopharyngiomaGDFilateral TemporalInferior QuadrantanopinMARROWLateral Chiasma (Bilateral)Dinasal HemianopiaOptic Tract (Dilateral)Bilateral HomonymousHemianopla",

Since anterior visual pathways are not affected in cortical blindness, direct andconsensual light reflexes are preserved.Cortical blindness is usually associated with bilateral occipital infarcts where it is supplied by theposterior cerebral arteries and these infarcts usually involve both the primary visual cortex andvisual association area. It is secondary to damage to the visual pathways posterior to the lateralgeniculate nuclei; anterior visual pathways are intact. Visual field defects can vary depending onthe extent and location of the infarct.Direct and consensual reflexes are present in both eyes in cortical blindness as pupillary lightreflex fibers exit the visual pathway at the level of the superior colliculus. They exit the optic tractbefore the lateral geniculate body (LGB) to reach the center for pupillary light reflex- pretectalnucleus at the midbrain.Note: Anton syndrome is visual anosognosia (denial of loss of vision) associated withconfabulation (defined as the emergence of memories of events and experiences which never tookplace) in the setting of obvious visual loss and cortical blindness.",

Marcus Gunn pupil also known as relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) is the earliestsign of optic nerve disease as seen in optic nerve neuritis or primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG).RAPD is caused due to a defect in the afferent pathway (optic nerve) of the pupillary light reflex inone eye.It is diagnosed by the swinging flashlight test where the flashlight is swung to and fro, and thepupillary response is observed. Normally, both pupils constrict when any one eye is stimulated(due to direct and consensual light reflex). In the presence of RAPD, bothpupils will abnormally dilate when the affected eye is stimulated. This paradoxical response of thepupil to light is called Marcus Gunn pupil.Causes of RAPD:• Optic nerve lesions (e.g.All types of optic neuritis, glaucoma)•Optic tract lesions (e.g., infarction)• Severe retinal disease (e.g., central retinal artery occlusion, extensive retinal detachment)•Maculopathy (macular degeneration)Other options:Option B: Adie tonic pupil is a unilateral dilated pupil with light-near dissociation due topostganglionic parasympathetic pupillomotor nerve supply damage.

Pupillary constrictionto 0.1% pilocarpine diagnoses Adie's pupil (due to denervation hypersensitivity). Application of0.1% pilocarpine shows no response in other conditions or in the normal eye.Example: A person presenting with dilated pupil following accidental application or inadvertentrubbing of atropine or antimuscarinic alkaloids from wild plants into the eye will not constrict inresponse to topical application of 1% Pilocarpine. But the patient showing dilation due to 3rdnerve palsy shows pupillary constriction in response to pupillary instillation of 1% pilocarpine.Note: Cocaine and phenylephrine are used in anisocoria that is greater in the dark to diagnoseHorner's syndrome.

It causes miosis.Horner's syndrome (oculosympathetic palsy)The majority of the cases are unilateral.Causes of bilateral involvement include cervical spine injuries and autonomic diabeticneuropathy.Painful Horner syndrome, especially of acute onset, should raise the possibility of carotiddissection.Clinical features• Mild ptosis (usually 1-2 mm) as a result of weakness of Müller muscle•Anisocoria is accentuated in dim light•Pupillary constriction to light and near stimuli is normal.⚫ Hypochromic heterochromia (lighter color iris on affected side); in congenital cases.•505• Mild ptosis (Mullers muscle is affected)• Reduced ipsilateral sweating (only if the lesion is below the superior cervical ganglion)Pharmacological tests• Hydroxyamphetamine and adrenaline may be used to differentiate a preganglionic from apostganglionic lesion.•Phenylepherine (1%)• Result: In an established (10 days) postganglionic lesion, the Horner pupil will dilate and ptosismay be temporarily relieved. A central or preganglionic Horner pupil and a normal pupil will notdilate or will dilate minimally.• Explanation: In postganglionic Horner's syndrome, the dilator pupillae muscle developsdenervation hypersensitivity to adrenergic neurotransmitters due to its dysfunctional local motornerve.•• Apraclonidine (0.5% or 1.0%)• Result: A Horner pupil will dilate, but a normal pupil is essentially unaffected.•Explanation: Alpha-1 receptors are upregulated in the denervated dilator pupillae.• Cocaine (4%) is instilled into both eyes••Result: The normal pupil will dilate, but the Horner pupil will not.• Explanation: Cocaine blocks the re-uptake of noradrenaline secreted at the postganglionic nerveending, which accumulates and causes dilatation of a normal pupil. In Horner's syndrome, thereis no noradrenaline being secreted, so cocaine has no effect.",

      "explanation": "Simultaneous lesion in both sympathetic and parasympathetic supply of the eye leads to mid-sizedpupil that doesn't react to light.Pupillary dilation is achieved by sympathetic innervation of dilator pupillae. Therefore, any lesionof the sympathetic supply of the pupil leads to constricted pupil.Pupillary constriction is a parasympathetic function. Lesions in this pathway leads to dilated pupiland failure to constrict.A mid-sized unreactive pupil due to a lesion of both parasympathetic and sympathetic supplies isseen in aneurysms of the internal carotid artery within the cavernous sinus.",

      "explanation": "The most common feature seen in diabetic oculomotor palsy among the given options is ptosis.In the anatomical arrangement of the nerve fibers of the 3rd cranial nerve, the fibers controllingthe pupillary reflex are present superficially and are thus spared from diabetic ischemia-inducedinjury which starts from the central nerve fibres. Thus, pupil sparing is commonly seen in diabeticpatients.507The etiology of diabetic neuropathy is hyperglycemia-induced damage to nerve cells and neuronalischemic change due to microvascular angiopathy.Involvement of the third cranial nerve is most common and it often presents with early features ofptosis and diplopia with pupil sparing.The involvement of levator palpebrae superioris muscle of the eyelid manifests as ptosis and theinvolvement of extraocular muscles such as medial rectus, inferior rectus and inferior obliquepresents as opthalmoplegia with diplopia. All the muscles mentioned above are supplied by theOcculomotor nerve.Note: Aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery is an important cause of isolated thirdnerve palsy with involvement of the pupil. This is because the aneurysm impinges on thesuperficial pupil nerve fibres of the 3rd cranial nerve.",

      "explanation": "Ptosis and double vision with no other features suggest an acquired, isolated 3rd nerve palsy withpupillary sparing. This is seen in ischemic conditions such as diabetes.The vasoneurium supplies the nerve from outside to inside. As the somatic fibres are located inthe inner part of the nerve, these fibres are affected more in the setting of ischemia. Theparasympathetic pupillary fibres which run on the outside can remain unaffected (resulting inpupillary sparing). In compressive lesions, the parasympathetic fibres are affected before anydisruption of the motor fibres. So pupillary sparing is not seen.Isolated 3rd nerve palsyCauses• Microvascular disease associated with systemic risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes isthe most common cause of third nerve palsy.• Aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery at its junction with the internal carotid, bothdirect and secondary to subdural hematoma with uncal herniation.••Episodic migraine, compression, ischemia, and alterations in intracranial pressureMiscellaneous- tumour and inflammatory diseases such as syphilis, Lyme disease, andsarcoidosis; giant cell arteritis; and vasculitis associated with collagen vascular disorders.Signs• Profound ptosis due to the weakness of the levator muscle.• Abduction and depression in the primary position (\"down and out\")• Normal abduction as the lateral rectus is intact• Limited adduction due to medial rectus weakness• Limited elevation due to the weakness of the superior rectus and inferior oblique508",
