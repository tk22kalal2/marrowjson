The second most common site for orbitalblowout fracture is the medial wall of the orbit.The patient with blow out fracture usually presents with immediate periorbital edema and bloodextravasation in and around the orbit. Proptosis of the eyeball secondary to orbital edema orhemorrhage with paresthesia along the infraorbital nerve are also very common.Imaging by a plain x-ray in water's view or by CT demonstrates depression of bony fragments andorbital contents herniating through the orbital floor into the maxillary antrum.

      "explanation": "Severe ocular damage associated with a \"blowout\" fracture is rare.This is because a \"blowout fracture\" is nature's way of protecting the globe from injury.Clinical features of blow out fracture are as follows:• Periorbital edema• Paresthesia and anesthesia in the distribution of the infraorbital nerve (lower lid, cheek, side ofthe nose, upper lip, and upper teeth)• Emphysema of the eyelids-more frequent with medial wall fractures415• Proptosis-seen initially due to orbital edema and hemorrhage.• After about 10 days, as the edema decreases, the eyeball sinks backward and somewhatinferiorly, resulting in enophthalmos and mechanical ptosis.• Double diplopia- diplopia in upward as well as downward gaze",
