      "explanation": "The nasolacrimal duct is 12-18 mm long.The lacrimal drainage system consists of the lacrimal sac, which is 10-12 mm long. It lies in thelacrimal fossa, between the anterior and posterior lacrimal crests. The lacrimal bone and thefrontal process of the maxilla separate the lacrimal sac from the middle meatus of the nasal cavity.The nasolacrimal duct is the inferior continuation of the lacrimal sac. It is 12–18 mm long and isdirected downwards, backward, and laterally. The opening of the duct into the inferior meatus ispartially covered by a mucosal fold (valve of Hasner).The puncta are openings on the lid margin. There are two canaliculi from the puncta. Eachcanaliculus (superior and inferior) has two parts: Vertical (2 mm) and horizontal (8 mm). Thesuperior and inferior canaliculi usually unite to form the common canaliculus, which opens intothe lateral wall of the lacrimal sac. A small flap of mucosa (Rosenmüller valve) overhangs thejunction of the common canaliculus and the lacrimal sac and prevents the reflux of tears into thecanaliculi.The image below shows structures of the lacrimal apparatus.398LacrimalglandExcretoryducts of thelacrimal glandLacrimal-sacNasolacrimalductLacrimal ApparatusUppercanaliculusOMARROWCommoncanaliculus- LowercanaliculusValve ofHasner",
