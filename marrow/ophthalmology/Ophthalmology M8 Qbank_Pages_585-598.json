Glaucoma is not a known association ofacute gout.Ocular manifestations seen in acute gout are episcleritis, scleritis, and uveitis. Ocular structureshave a relatively poor solvent ability, in addition to lower temperatures. Therefore, they arepredisposed to tophi deposition. As a result of urate deposits, crystal-induced inflammation of theaffected tissue is responsible for causing episcleritis, scleritis, and uveitis.592",

Potential pathogenic mechanisms include a direct viral effecton the eye, an immune-mediated vasculitis, and/or a variety of secondary effects related todengue-induced vascular leakage and hemostatic derangements.Ocular manifestations of dengue:• Typically, patients complain of painless visual impairment within 1 week from illness onset,often around the time of the platelet nadir.•Conjunctival injection and subconjunctival hemorrhage.Complications such as retinal hemorrhage, retinal edema, macular ischemia, macular edema,vitreous hemorrhage, vitritis, and optic neuritis or papillitis595•Depending on the severity of the ocular lesion, gradual improvement in vision occurs overseveral weeks, although in rare cases permanent visual impairment may result.",

Glaucoma is the most common ocular manifestation of SWS.Sturge weber syndrome is a neurocutaneous disorder (phakomatoses) that is characterized byunilateral capillary malformation at the region of trigeminal supply known as port wine stain ornevus flammeus, ipsilateral diffuse cavernous hemangioma of the choroid and ipsilateralleptomeningeal hemangiomatosis, which causes seizures and mental retardation.Ocular manifestation of SWS include:•Glaucoma - most common ocular manifestation. It develops anywhere between infancy toadulthood. When developed in infancy it presents as buphthalmos.• Diffuse choroidal hemangioma• Serous retinal detachment• Visual field defects- homonymous hemianopia due to the leptomeningeal hemangiomas affectingthe optic tract or occipital lobe.•Heterochromia of the iris• Episcleral and conjunctival lesionsOption A: Uveitis is the inflammation of the uveal tissue of the eyes. It can be associated with anumber of systemic conditions such as sarcoidosis, behcet's disease, ankylosing spondylitis,reiter's syndrome, Toxoplasmosis and Posner-Schlossman syndrome (PSS).Option B: Retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited or acquired pigmentatory retinal dystrophyaffecting the rods more.

Abnormal newvessel formation, which occurs on the inner (vitreous) surface of the retina and may extend intothe vitreous cavity, can cause vitreous haemorrhage. Neovascularization is often accompanied bypre-retinal fibrous tissue, which, along with the vitreous, can contract, resulting in traction retinaldetachment. In addition, tiny microaneurysms can also be seen.",
