Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most commonsoft tissue sarcoma of childhood.40% of rhabdomyosarcomas develop in the head and neck, and they are the most commonprimary orbital malignancy in children but are still a rare condition. The older age of the childpresenting with proptosis suggests rhabdomyosarcoma (average age 7 to 8 years) thanretinoblastoma (average age at presentation is 18 months).The histopathology shows elongated to round spindle cells with features of skeletal muscle atdifferent stages of maturation with highly eosinophilic cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei – theembryonal type of rhabdomyosarcomaImmunohistochemistry is useful in identifying skeletal muscle proteins, such as alpha-actin,myosin, desmin, and myoglobinRhabdomyosarcoma shows a strong tendency for local invasion, local recurrence, andhematogenous and lymphatic metastases.Decision-making for management is based on histopathologic confirmation as well as the stagingof orbital RMS, which includes imaging (MRI of primary tumor, chest-CT, Tc bone scan),pathology, and work-up for metastases(bone marrow biopsy).Treatment options include chemotherapy (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and actinomycin D) andradiotherapy.",

A largemajority of these children develop bilateral and multifocal tumors.•In sporadic cases, both RB alleles must undergo somatic mutation in the same retinoblast (twohits).Familial retinoblastoma patients also have a predisposition to non-ocular cancers because of thepresence of the mutation in all cells, such as pinealoblastoma (usually before the age of 5 years),osteosarcomas, soft tissue sarcomas, and melanomas.Note:547Trilateral retinoblastoma = Pinealoblastoma + Bilateral retinoblastoma",
