      "explanation": "The distance of the fovea from the temporal margin of the optic disc is 2 disc diameters.The fovea is an excavation in the retinal surface at the center of the macula, with a diameter of 1.5mm, which is about the same as that of the optic disc. The foveola forms the bottom of the foveaand has a diameter of 0.35 mm. It is devoid of ganglion cells. The umbo is the central floor thefoveola, which corresponds to the foveolar light reflex. The foveal avascular zone (FAZ) is a centralarea (including foveola and surrounding areas) which contains no blood vessels but is surroundedby a continuous network of capillaries.The macula is a round area at the posterior pole, lying inside the temporal vascular arcades. Itmeasures 5.5 mm in diameter. The inner layers of the macula contain the yellow xanthophyllcarotenoid pigments lutein and zeaxanthin in far higher concentrations than the peripheral retina(hence, the full name \"macula lutea\", which means yellow plaque).MaculaLuteaFoveaCentralisArteryOptic nerveOptic diskPeripheral RetinaVein201",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Optic disc hypoplasia does not cause enlargement of the blind spot.The physiological blind spot is an area of absolute scotoma in the visual field, seen in the region ofoptic disc. It is due to the absence of photoreceptors (rods and cones) in that region. Enlargedblind spot is seen in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) (Option A), papilledema (Option C),medullated nerve fibers (Option D), optic disc drusen, coloboma of optic disc andmyopic disc with a crescent.Optic nerve hypoplasia is the most common congenital optic disc anomaly. There isunderdevelopment of the optic disc in the disease and it typically presents with a small disc that issurrounded by a yellowish pigmented ring, called the 'double ring sign'.Option A: In primary open-angle glaucoma(POAG), the optic disc enlargement is seen secondaryto increased intra-ocular pressure (IOP) in the eye.Option C: Papilledema is a passive disc swelling seen with raised intracranial pressure. The blindspot is enlarged due to the edema of the optic disc.Option D: Medullated or opaque nerve fibers are the abnormal myelination of nerve fibers of theretina. Normally, optic nerve myelination stops at the level of lamina cribrosa. If the myelinationcontinues beyond the optic disc it leads to the expansion of the blind spot. On ophthalmoscopicexamination, these are seen as a whitish patch with feathery margins.",

Their nuclei lie in the inner nuclear layer and their processes extend across theretinal layers to form the inner and outer limiting membranes. Their functions include:1. Providing structural stability to the retinal2. Interacting with other neurons and their functional and metabolic support3. Providing neurons with trophic substances and removing metabolic waste4. Playing a critical role in regulating the extracellular space volume as well as ion and waterhomeostasis and in maintaining the inner blood-retinal barrierAstrocytes are another type of macroglial cells of the retina. They play a crucial role in retinalvascularization. In the mature retina, they are restricted to the nerve fiber and ganglion celllayers.",

Thebest immediate step in management is ocular massage among the given options.Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) occurs due to obstruction of the retinal artery at the levelof lamina cribrosa. Risk factors include heart disease, carotid artery disease, mucormycosis,varicella infection, radiation exposure and trauma. It may be caused by the following:Emboli of carotid artery or cardiac origin are the most common cause of CRAO. Other emboliare cholesterol emboli, calcium emboli, and platelet fibrin emboli• Atherosclerosis-related thrombosis• Retinal arteritis with obliteration•Angiospasm• Raised intraocular pressure• Thrombophilic disorders216Patients often present with sudden painless monocular loss of vision with history of a similarepisode that resolved spontaneously (amaurosis fugax). On examination, direct pupillary reflex isabsent and relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) is positive. Fundus examination showsmarked attenuation of arteries (thread like arteries), interrupted blood flow in vein (cattletrack appearance), cherry red spot, severe edema and retinal pallor.A cherry-red spot of the macula is typical and arises in this area because of the absence ofganglion cells at the foveola resulting in the transmission of the normal choroidal color. This incontrast to the surrounding area where intense retinal whitening blocks the transmission of thenormal choroidal color.Treatment is to dislodge the emboli by suddenly decreasing the IOP by IV acetazolamide or ocularmassage. Ocular massage is considered the most effective method. Other treatment optionsinclude IV mannitol, vasodilators (nitrates), fibrinolytic therapy, or laser photodisruption in somecases. In cases of giant cell arteritis, steroids are beneficial.",

Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is the most common type of retinal detachment.It occurs due to fluid accumulation after a retinal break (tear).

      "explanation": "The above image shows a loss of foveal reflex and central serous retinopathy, therefore showingfocal foveal detachment.There is oedema at the fovea signifying foveal detachment from underlying retinal pigmentepithelium. Macular oedema is also present (grey dull retina with a ring reflex around the site ofoedema). Thus, the most appropriate choice would be foveal detachment.221Central serous retinopathy is the spontaneous serous detachment of neurosensory retina in themacular region. It occurs due to increased permeability of choriocapillaris, leading to fluidaccumulation in the subretinal space. Therefore, it is now known as centralserous choriopathy (CSC).If there is serous retinal detachment at macula, there is sudden painless loss of vision. Patientsalso have relative positive scotoma, micropsia and metamorphopsia. On ophthalmoscopy, acircular ring reflex present. The foveal reflex is absent. On fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA),an enlarging ink-blot pattern or smoke-stack pattern is seen.Treatment is generally not required. It is usually self-limiting, but often recurrent. Steroids arecontraindicated.DAILYROUNDS",
