      "explanation": "The given clinical vignette of a patient presenting with decreased visual acuity and a history oftransverse myelitis which is treated with steroids is indicative of Neuromyelitis optica (NMO).Neuromyelitis optica also known as Devic's disease is an autoimmune demyelinating disease inwhich antibodies are formed against Aquaporin 4 present in the cell membranes of Astrocytes. Itis characterized by the findings of unilateral or bilateral optic neuritis developing within a fewweeks of transverse myelitis (demyelination of the spinal cord). The disease may be monophasic orrecurrent.Diagnostic Criteria for Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD):Diagnostic Criteria for NMOSD associated with AQP4-IgG• At least 1 core clinical characteristic• A positive test for AQP4-IgG using the best available detection method (cell-based assay)• Exclusion of alternative diagnoses•Core Clinical Characteristics:Optic neuritis is usually bilateral and causes severe visual loss.• Acute myelitis- may be severe, transverse and typically longitudinally extensive involving threeor more contiguous vertebral segments.• Area postrema syndrome: episodes of otherwise unexplained hiccups or nausea or vomiting•• Acute brainstem syndrome•Symptomatic narcolepsy associated with NMOSD-typical diencephalic MRI lesionsFor acute cases of NMO, high-dose glucocorticoids or plasma exchange is used. Mycophenolatemofetil, rituximab, and glucocorticoids with azathioprine are used for prophylaxis againstrelapses.The FDA has approved satralizumab, a humanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody, for the treatmentof NMO spectrum disorder with AQP4 antibody positivity.Eculizumab, a complement inhibitor, and inebilizumab, a B-cell depletion agent, are two morenew drugs that have recently been approved for use in NMO attack prevention.524A history of transverse myelitis with optic neuritis (decreased visual acuity) rules out Multiplesclerosis (option D). It is an autoimmune inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the CNS thataffects both upper motor neurons (UMN) and lower motor neurons (LMN) with involvement ofsensory system, ocular system and bowel and bladder function. Ocular manifestations of MSinclude Optic neuritis (usually retrobulbar)- decreased visual acuity, internuclear ophthalmoplegiaand nystagmus.",

Visual acuity andcolour vision are also relatively more preserved in papilledema compared to papillitis.The other three disc signs seen on ophthalmoscopy are present in both papillitis and papilledema.",

      "explanation": "Down-beat nystagmus is usually due to a lesion at the cervico-medullary junction (e.g.Arnold-Chiari malformation, syringobulbia) or as a manifestation of cerebellar degeneration.Other causes of down-beat nystagmus:• Drugs (phenytoin, lithium, barbiturates, carbamazepine)• Wernicke's encephalopathy• Demyelinating disordersAcquired nystagmus can be attributed to disturbances of the three mechanisms that normallyensure steady gaze-visual fixation, the vestibulo-ocular reflex, and the mechanism that makes itpossible to hold the eyes at an eccentric eye position (e.g. far-right gaze).Other types of nystagmus:529Type of NystagmusSlow-horizontalEtiologyLargeposterior cerebrallesions (e.g. stroke)Mixed horizontal (Torsional) Usually associated with vertiUp-beatPeriodic alternatingSee-sawGaze-evokedgo and seen investibular systemlesionsMedulla,the ventral tegmentum and the anterior vermis of the cerebellumCerebellar disease (In PAN, the horizontal jerk nystagmus spontaneously reverses the direction of the quick phase every few seconds)Lesion involvingparasellar region and optic chiasm(e.g. pituitary tumours, third ventricle)Side-effect ofdrugs, includingsedatives, anticonvulsants and alcohol, as well ascerebellardisease",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Fracture of the temporal bone causes vestibular injury resulting in a horizontal nystagmus withslow phase towards the affected side and fast phase towards the opposite side.Peripheral vestibular nystagmus occurs in lesions of the labyrinth or vestibular nerve. Normally,there is tonic input to the brainstem vestibular nuclei from the periphery. Loss of the tonic inputfrom the left vestibular nerve leads to deviation of the eyes towards the left side, which is the slowphase of the nystagmus. The cortical correction brings the eyes back to the centre in the primarygaze which is the fast-phase directed towards the right side.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "In internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) the lesion is at the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF).In INO, there is impaired adduction on the ipsilateral side of the lesion, and nystagmus onabduction on the contralateral side. When the gaze is initiated in the motor cortex, the horizontalgaze center or the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) generates the eye movements.The PPRF has two outputs. The first is to the ipsilateral 6th cranial nerve nucleus which causesabduction of the ipsilateral eye. The second output is to the contralateral MLF which sends animpulse to the contralateral 3rd cranial nerve nucleus causing contralateral adduction. These twooutputs from PPRF lead to conjugate movement of the eyes to the same side.530Therefore, a lesion in the right MLF leads to failure of the right eye adduction. The left eye,however, abducts normally. This is called internuclear ophthalmoplegia.The following image shows the pathway for horizontal eye movements as described above.REPrimary gazeRight gaze(Normal)I/L adductionabsentLeft gaze(defect)LEC/L abduction presentwith nystagmusOMARROWAnatomical pathway for horizontaleye movementsRight FEFMR3rdMASRight EyeMLFPPRE6thLeft EyePPREFEFParamedian pontine reticular formationFrontal eye fieldMLFMRMedial longitudinal fasciculusMedial rectusLRLateral rectusOMARROWLR",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Horizontal gaze palsy can occur due to a lesion in parapontine reticular formation (PPRF).Horizontal gaze:• It involves 2 muscles- the ipsilateral lateral rectus and the contralateral medial rectus.• Center for this pathway is parapontine reticular formation (PPRF).• From here, they move to the ipsilateral 6th nerve nucleus.531• Next, they pass through the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) to the contralateral medialrectus subnucleus.Lesions affecting the abducens nuclei will also cause ipsilateral horizontal gaze palsy, because ofdamage to motor neurons and internuclear neurons originating from the nuclei. Lesions involvingthe PPRF will lead to horizontal gaze palsy, as PPRF acts as a relay centre that connects thefrontal eye fields in the cerebral cortex to the abducens nuclei. Conjugate horizontal gaze palsycan also be caused by lesion(s) involving both the abducens motor fibres and the MLFs precedingthe abducens nucleus. Bilateral horizontal gaze palsy will be caused if lesion(s) involve bothabducens nuclei or bilateral PPRF.Isolated damage to the MLFs will cause the classic INO where eye abduction is preserved,however, the ipsilateral eye will not be able to be adducted on conjugate horizontal gaze.Conjugate eye movements• Binocular movements in which the eyes move synchronously and symmetrically in the samedirection.• Main types• Saccades: They are fast movements controlled by the contralateral frontal lobe..• Pursuits: They are slow following movements controlled by the ipsilateral occipital lobe.Image: The Horizontal gaze pathwayAnatomical pathway for horizontaleye movementsRight FEFMR3rdMASRight EyeMLFPPRF6thLeft EyePPREFEFParamedian pontine reticular formationFrontal eye fieldMLFMRLRMedial longitudinal fasciculusMedial rectusLateral rectusOMARROWLR•Lesions in this pathwayHorizontal gaze palsy: Due to lesion in the PPRF of the same side• Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO): Caused by lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus(MLF)• One and a half syndrome: Caused by lesions in both MLF and PPRF of the same sideVertical gaze palsyCenter is located in the rostral interstitial nucleus of the dorsal midbrain (riMLF).532The important types of vertical gaze palsy are as follows:• Parinaud's syndrome: Upgaze palsy•Steel-Richardsons syndrome: Downgaze palsy",

      "explanation": "The most likely location of the lesion according to the given clinical scenario and the image isthe right medial longitudinal fasciculus.The image depicts an attempted left gaze and concludes that there is an adduction deficit in theright eye. This causes jerk nystagmus in the abducting left eye.This is most likely due to a lesion of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) ipsilateral to theside of the adduction deficit.
