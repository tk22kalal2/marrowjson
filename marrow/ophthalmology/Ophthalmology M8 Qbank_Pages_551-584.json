      "explanation": "563The angle subtended by the largest alphabet on the Snellens chart at 60m distance is 5 minutes.Visual acuity is a measure of the spatial resolution of the eye or an estimation of its ability todiscriminate between two points. Snellens chart is used for Visual acuity assesment.In snellens chart the alphabets decrease in size as we move from above-downwards and theselines, from above-downwards should be read at 60, 36, 24, 18, 12, 9, 6, 5 and 4 m respectively. Atthese distances, the respective letters subtend a visual angle of 5 minutes. Hence, the largestalphabet that should be read at 60 m subtends a visual angle of 5 minutes in the eye.ED-365' of arc1' of arcHD-24NK RD-18U OP CD-12LDETRD-9ABNC PVD-6RVTNF DOSnellen's AnglesEach stroke → 1 min arcTotal Stroke, E-5 min arc36 mPerson viewing6 times inwardMARROEEach stroke 6 min arc6 x 5 30 min of arcOMARROW6 mPerson viewing",

      "explanation": "The given image is suggestive of oculomotor nerve palsy.The central image shows the primary position of gaze where the patient's left eye is deviated downand out with ptosis of the left eyelid. From the eye movements in other positions, it can be seenthat adduction and elevation are absent and depression is reduced in the left eye. All of thesefindings are indicative of oculomotor nerve palsy.3rd Cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy presents with:• Ptosis due to weakness of levator palpebrae superioris muscle (LPS)•Abduction and depression in the primary position (down and out) due to unopposed action ofthe lateral rectus(6th nerve supply) and superior oblique muscles(4th nerve supply)•Dilated pupil and defective accommodation due to parasympathetic palsy (involvement ofEdinger Westphal parasympathetic supply)• Limited adduction, elevation and depression due to ipsilateral paralysis of medial rectus, inferioroblique and inferior rectus.Signs of Oculomotor Nerve PalsyDescriptionProfound plosis due toVAZONES İness of levatorAbduction1° gaze duG to unopposednotion of lateral rootus& Superior obliqueIntorsion due to intactsuperior obliqueLimitaci depressiondue to VVEAk interiorroctusLimited elevation due toInferior obliquoDilatedpupil duestoAsjud oneujiochiUASGudNormal abduotion(C) MARROVAVEOption A: Trochlear(4th cranial) nerve palsy presents with superior oblique muscle paralysis.Clinical findings of trochlear nerve palsy include:581•Hypertropia (elevation) in the primary position• Extorsion that is greatest in abduction•Compensatory head posture with contralateral face turn and head tilt with chin slightlydepressed. This position is assumed to avoid Diplopia.• Limitation of depression• Normal abduction and elevation.The below given image depicts 4th cranial nerve palsy.M0OMARROWOption B: Lateral rectus palsy is seen in cases of isolated Abducens nerve palsy. These patientspresent with esotropia/convergent squint in primary position with limitation of abduction on theside of the lesion. This is due to unopposed action of the medial rectus muscle in the affected eye.There is also a compensatory head turn towards the side of the lesion to reduce the symptom ofDiplopia.

      "explanation": "Photostress test is used to differentiate between the disease involving the macula and optic nerve.This test is of particular use in early macular diseases such as central serous retinopathy.In this test, one eye is covered and the patient is asked to read the smallest line on the near chart.A bright light is then shone into the eye for 15 seconds, and the patient is asked to read the lineagain, and the time taken to recover is noted. The test is repeated with the other eye.583In normal people and in patients with optic nerve disease, the recovery time is not affected.Whereas, in patients with macular disease the recovery time is prolonged and is usually more thanone-third of the normal recovery time. This is because, in macular disease, the photoreceptors aredamaged, and there is a delay in the visual pigment regeneration process.584",
