In the given image, the above imagerefers to the examiner's view and the below image refers to the patient's view.The Maddox rod can be used to test for horizontal and vertical deviations, and when used inconjunction with another Maddox rod, for cyclo-deviations.Interpretation:To test for horizontal deviations, the Maddox rod is placed in front of one eye (for this example,the left eye) with the cylinders in the horizontal direction. The patient fixates a point source oflight and then sees a vertical red line with the left eye and white dot/light with the right eye:• Orthophoria: if the light/dot superimposes the line.•Exo-deviation/exophoria: In this example, light/dot is on the left side of the line (rod placed onleft eye)• Eso-deviation/esophoria: if the light was on the right side of the line (rod placed on left eye)Maddox Rod Test involves the use of a Maddox rod and the Maddox tangent scale. It uses aspecially constructed device, consisting of a series of parallel cylinders, that converts a pointsource of light into a line image. The optical properties of the cylinders cause the streak of light tobe situated 90° to the orientation of the parallel cylinders.461Maddox tangent scale3.2.1x654321 0 0 12345628-26-24-22-20-18-16-14-12-0987654321001234567890 12-14-16-18-20-22-24-26-28MARROWOMARROWMaddox rodOMARROWIn the image given below, the interpretation of the result is based on how the patient visualizes it.It would appear to be crossed to the patient.
