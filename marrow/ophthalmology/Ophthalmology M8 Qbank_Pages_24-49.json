      "explanation": "The given figure is a Sturm's conoid. It represents a bundle of light rays formed by a regularly astigmatic surface. The image is clearest or least confusing at point D, the circle of least confusion. When light passes through a regularly astigmatic surface (surface with toric curvature), vertical and horizontal rays converge at different points. The distance between the points of convergence (focus) of the vertical and horizontal rays is called the focal interval of Sturm (distance between points B and F). The circle of least confusion/circle of diffusion lies at the mid-point of this interval. For the given Sturm's conoid, • At point A, a horizontal oval is formed because vertical rays converge more rapidly than horizontal rays. • At point B, vertical rays come to a focus, while horizontal rays are still converging; so, it will be a horizontal straight line. • At points C, D, and E, the vertical rays are diverging and horizontal rays are still converging. • At point D, the vertical rays have diverged as much as the horizontal rays have converged; so, we get a perfect circle called the circle of least confusion. • At point E, a vertical oval is formed. • At point F, a vertical straight line is formed. • At point G and beyond, both rays are diverging, and we always get a vertical oval/prolate ellipse.",

      "explanation": "The Stiles-Crawford effect refers to the greater sensitivity of the retina to perpendicular rays than the oblique rays. It is one of the natural mechanisms that decrease aberration in the eye. The rays of light that enter through the center of the pupil have higher sensitivity as compared to those entering from the periphery of the pupil. Natural mechanisms that decrease aberrations in the human eye: • Cutting-off of the peripheral rays by the iris • The high refractive index of the core of the nucleus of the lens than that of the peripheral cortex • Low sensitivity of the peripheral retina • Stiles-Crawford effect",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The angle subtended by the optotype (individual letters on the chart) on the second line of Snellen's chart in the above case would be 30 minutes of arc. The second line on Snellen's chart corresponds to a distance of 36 meters. When viewed from a 6m distance, it is denoted as visual acuity 6/36. Where, the numerator (6) denotes the distance from which the patient is actually viewing it, and the denominator (36) denotes the distance at which it should be ideally viewed. It denotes the distance at which each stroke of the letter would subtend the minimum angle of resolution (MAR) of one minute of arc. MAR = 1/Visual acuity. Each letter is shaped such that it can be placed in a square, the sides of which are five times the breadth of individual limbs of the letters. Hence, the angle subtended by the optotype = MAR x 5. For example, at exactly 6 meters distance from the patient, the letters on the 6/6 line shall subtend 5 minutes of arc (such that the individual limbs of the letters subtend 1 minute of arc). The equation to calculate the minimum angle of resolution (MAR) is given as follows: For the given question, MAR = 1/6/36, MAR = 36/6, MAR = 6 minutes of arc. Hence, the angle subtended by the entire letter is 6 × 5 = 30 minutes of arc.",

      "explanation": "The approximate percentage of aniseikonia in a person with monocular aphakia wearing a contact lens would be 8%. Aniseikonia is defined as the difference in image size between the two eyes and can lead to disturbances in stereopsis. The tolerable limit of aniseikonia is 5-8%. It is reduced with a contact lens (8%) compared to glasses (25-30%) in aphakia. However, the percentage of aniseikonia is least with an intraocular lens (IOL) (1-3%), thus secondary IOL implantation is the most preferred management of unilateral aphakia.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Floccular nucleus of the cerebellum controls ocular saccades. A saccade is a rapid ballistic movement to change the point of fixation. It is the fastest of all eye movements and is initiated by the contralateral frontal lobe. Smooth pursuit is a slow tracking movement to keep the target on the fovea. It is controlled by the ipsilateral parieto-occipital lobe. Following an object from the right to left is left pursuit and is controlled by the ipsilateral (left) parieto-occipital lobe, and the corrective movement is a saccade (in this case, left to right) termed right saccade and is controlled by the contralateral (right) frontal lobe. The floccular nucleus is found in the lobule X of the cerebellar vermis. Its functions include matching pulse-step, gaze holding, and sustained smooth pursuit. Bilateral lesions of the flocculus result in the following: • Post-saccadic drift - saccadic movements do not stop, but there is a brief, several hundred milliseconds drift of the eyes after each saccade. • Saccadic pursuit - smooth tracking is replaced by simultaneous rapid jerking motions of the eye to follow an object toward the ipsilateral visual field. • Gaze-evoked nystagmus - impaired ability to hold the eyes in the eccentric position, resulting in gaze-evoked nystagmus towards the affected side of the cerebellum. Emboliform and globose nuclei: Generation of vertical saccades. Fastigial nuclei: Pursuit initiation.",

      "explanation": "The aqueous outflow facility is about 0.28 µL/min/mmHg. Aqueous humor is produced at an average rate of 2.0-2.5 µL/min. The ease with which the aqueous humor leaves the eye is called an aqueous outflow facility. The outflow facility is measured using tonography. The normal range is between 0.22–0.28 µL/min/mmHg. A juxtacanalicular portion of the trabecular meshwork is the primary limiting factor for the outflow facility. Uveoscleral outflow accounts for 10% of the total aqueous outflow facility. Aqueous outflow facility decreases with aging. Trabecular outflow facility is reduced in glaucoma. Laser trabeculoplasty reduces intraocular pressure (IOP) in open-angle glaucoma by increasing the trabecular outflow facility.",

      "question": "Detailed Explanations: The anterior surface of the cornea is the most important factor influencing the focus of light rays on the retina. The refraction of light is at its maximum at the cornea, due to the curvature of the cornea and the difference between the refractive index of air and the tear film. Refractive indices of various surfaces of the eye: Surface - Refractive Index - Cornea: 1.376, Lens - Total: 1.386, Lens - Cortex (periphery): 1.401, Lens Nucleus: 1.406 (maximum), Aqueous Humor: 1.336, Vitreous Humor: 1.336. Solution to Question 2: The refractive index is at its maximum at the center of the lens. Refractive indices of the various surfaces of the eye: The total dioptric power of the lens is about 18 D (16 to 20 D). The lens is composed of 64% water, 35% protein, and 1% lipid/carbohydrates/trace elements, and these components contribute to the refractive index of the lens.
