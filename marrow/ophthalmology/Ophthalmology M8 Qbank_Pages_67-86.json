      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "With-the-rule astigmatism is normally seen in the eyes due to the pressure of the eyelids. In with-the-rule astigmatism, the vertical meridian is more curved. This is more common and often occurs due to the pressure of eyelids on the eye. In against-the-rule astigmatism (ATR) (option B), the horizontal meridian is more curved than the vertical meridian. In both these types, the principal meridians are vertical and horizontal (90 and 180 degrees) and are at right angles to each other. The other types of astigmatism include oblique and bi-oblique astigmatism. In oblique astigmatism (option C), the two principal meridians are not the horizontal and vertical meridians, although they are at right angles to each other. In bi-oblique astigmatism (option D), the two principal meridians are not at right angles to each other; for example, one may be at 40 degrees and the other, at 100 degrees.

        "A": "The horizontal meridian is more myopic.",

        "D": "The horizontal meridian is more hyperopic."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In with-the-rule astigmatism, the curvature of the vertical meridian is more than that of the horizontal meridian. The greater the curvature of the meridian, the more myopic that meridian is. Hence, the vertical meridian is more myopic in with-the-rule astigmatism. With-the-rule astigmatism is the type of astigmatism wherein the vertical curvature is always more than the horizontal curvature. Thus, irrespective of the type or cause of with-the-rule astigmatism, the vertical meridian is always more myopic (curved) than the horizontal meridian. Clinical types of astigmatism include with-the-rule astigmatism and against-the-rule astigmatism.",

Astigmatism is a refractive error in which the rays of light entering the eye are refracted differently in different meridians of the eye. Meridians of the eye correspond to the lines of longitude on a globe. There are two types of astigmatism - regular and irregular. In regular astigmatism, refractive power changes uniformly from one meridian to another. Thus, two principal meridians are present. The rays of light from infinity form two focal points due to the difference in curvature of the two principal meridians. Based on the relation of the two focal points to the retina, regular astigmatism has the following types: • Simple astigmatism: One focal point lies on the retina. In simple myopic type, the second focal point lies in front of the retina while in simple hypermetropic type, the second focal point lies behind the retina. • Compound astigmatism: In compound hypermetropic type, both focal points lie behind the retina. In compound myopic type, both focal points lie in front of the retina. • Mixed astigmatism: One focal point lies in front of while the second focal point lies behind the retina.

      "options": {
        "A": "+1.00 DS",
        "B": "-1.00 DC x 180 degrees",
        "C": "-1.00 DS",
        "D": "-1.00 DS - 1.00 DC x 180 degrees"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Among the above options, -1.00 DC x 180 degrees is the correct prescription for simple myopic astigmatism (SMA). There are three components for the prescription of glasses. 1. The first number is the refractive power of the spherical component. It is represented as convex (+) or concave (-) dioptre sphere (DS). 2. The second number denotes the power of the cylinder, represented as convex (+) or concave (-) dioptre cylinder (DC). 3. The above two components are followed by an 'x' representing the axis (orientation) of the cylinder. In the most common type of SMA, with-the-rule astigmatism, meridian A (represented by 90 degrees) is more curved than meridian B (represented by 180 degrees). The light rays refracting from B focus on the retina, whereas those refracting from A focus in front of the retina. To correct this error, a negative cylindrical lens (DC) is used to focus the myopic rays of meridian A on the retina. This correction needs to occur at 90 degrees (meridian A). The axis of a cylindrical lens is perpendicular to the required correction, and thus, the spectacles will have an axis of 180 degrees. There is no spherical refractive error since the light rays from meridian B lie on the retina. Thus, DS is 0.",

        "D": "Contraction of constrictor pupillae"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Near vision accommodation is due to the contraction of the ciliary muscle. Accommodation is the phenomenon of increasing the converging power. This occurs by increasing the refractive power of the lens and increasing its curvature. The capsule of the lens is more elastic than the lens itself and plays a role in increasing the curvature of the lens. When the circular fibres of the ciliary muscles contract, the ciliary body approaches the lens. This slackens the zonules so that the capsule, relieved of its tension, is able to mould the lens to its accommodative form.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Relaxation of the ciliary muscles would aid in establishing a normal distant vision. Relaxation of the ciliary muscles keeps the zonules in a taut state and maintains the radius of curvature of the anterior lens surface at 10 mm. Thus, the focal length is maximum and distant objects are most clearly visualized. Option B: The pupils constrict during accommodation to increase the depth of focus. Option C: During accommodation, ciliary muscles contract, causing relaxation of zonular fibers, rounding of the lens, and shortening of the focal length. Option D: The radius of curvature of the anterior lens surface becomes 6 mm, i.e., rounder during accommodation.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The condition in which accommodative power is significantly less than normal physiological limits for the patient's age is called insufficiency of accommodation. Anomalies of accommodation: Presbyopia - Failing near vision due to age-related decrease in the amplitude of accommodation or increase in near point. Insufficiency of accommodation - Inadequacy of the accommodative power. It is significantly less than normal physiological limits for the patient's age. Paralysis of accommodation - Complete absence of accommodation. Exertion or abnormally excessive accommodation. Presbyopia - Causes: Age-related change in the lens - decreased elasticity and sclerosis. Age-related decline in ciliary muscle power. Insufficiency of accommodation - Causes: Premature sclerosis of the lens. Weakness of the ciliary muscles due to systemic causes like anemia and malnutrition. Weakness of the ciliary muscles associated with primary open-angle glaucoma. Paralysis of accommodation - Causes: Drug-induced. Internal ophthalmoplegia due to diphtheria, diabetes mellitus, etc. As a component of 3rd nerve palsy. Spasm of accommodation - Causes: Drug-induced spasm, e.g., ecothiophate, pilocarpine.

Near point of accommodation (NPA) is the closest distance at which the near object is clearly focused without blur. Amplitude of accommodation is the maximum power of the lens that permits clear near vision without blur. Its unit is dioptre (D). The amplitude of accommodation is the reciprocal of NPA in meters. 20 cm is 1/5th of a meter. Therefore, accommodative amplitude is its inverse, that is, 5D. The NPA is measured clinically using a scale device such as the Prince, Berens, or Royal Air Force (RAF) ruler.",

      "explanation": "A 45-year-old woman presenting with an inability to do near vision work (reading, stitching) likely has presbyopia. Presbyopia is corrected by the use of a convex lens (weakest convex lens). Presbyopia can be caused by an age-related decline in the ciliary muscle power or age-related change in the lens, including: hardness (sclerosis) of the lens substance, which is less easily molded, and a decrease in the elasticity of the lens capsule.",

The greater the angle of the prism, the more will be thebending. In aphakic spectacles, the angle of the lens is large. Thus, the light falling at the edge ofthe lens bends towards the center of the lens and does not reach the pupil. This results in aring-shaped scotoma as this prismatic effect is present all around the edges of the lens.

Contact lens eliminate peripheral aberrations and can correctirregular astigmatism. Although dry eye is caused by wearing contact lenses, lenses made ofhydrogel which are high in water content are beneficial in dry eye.Rigid gas-permeable/semi-soft contact lens are used for keratoconus. Toric contact lens are usedfor astigmatism.",

Thus, it is apair of bifocal spectacles which is not used in hypermetropia or myopia.Bifocal glasses have different corrective powers in the upper segment for distant vision and lowersegment for near vision. Thus, they are useful in conditions where both distance and near visionare affected, like the following:1. Presbyopia (option A): It is a definitive indication. It is used to correct age-related near and farvision defects.2. Aphakia (option B): It provides both near and far vision correction when intra-ocular lens.insertion is contraindicated.3. Paediatric pseudophakia (option C): It is used to correct refractive errors or accommodativefluctuations post intra-ocular lens (IOL) insertion.4.
