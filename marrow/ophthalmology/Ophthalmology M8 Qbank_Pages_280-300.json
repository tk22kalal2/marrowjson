      "explanation": "The self-sealing sclerocorneal tunnel incision is made in small-incision cataract surgery (SICS).SICS is a type of extracapsular cataract extraction techniques (ECCE). In these techniques,the major portion of the anterior capsule with the epithelium, nucleus, and cortex are removed,leaving behind the intact posterior capsule.Note: Newer cataract surgeries include femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS),micro-incision cataract surgery (MICS) and Phaconit. FLACS is a microincision cataract surgery ora micro-phacoemulsification where a femtosecond laser is used to make the corneal incisions,perform capsulorhexis and fragment the lens. MICS refers to the phacoemulsification techniquesthat can be performed through a microincision (&lt;2 mm). Phaconit is the term for the bimanualmicro-phacoemulsification done with the needle incision technique through an incision of&lt;1mm.",

Therefore, weak and degenerated zonules are a prerequisite for this method. Methods of289lens delivery include cryoextraction (best method), forceps extraction (Arruga forceps), wire vectismethod and Indian Smith method. ICCE is no longer used for cataract treatment due to the largeincision required, inability to implant an IOL and a high rate of complications like vitreous loss,retinal detachment and cystoid macular edema.",

      "explanation": "A post cataract surgery patient presenting within 36 hours of surgery with inflammation,congestion and hypopyon as seen in the image, is suggestive of acute bacterial endophthalmitis.The treatment of acute bacterial endophthalmitis is intravitreal antibiotics.Endophthalmitis is an intraocular inflammation affecting the inner structures of the eyeball.Acute postoperative bacterial endophthalmitis occurs within 1-7 days after cataract surgery andthe most important factor to prevent it is preoperative administration of 5% povidone iodine. Thecardinal features of endophthalmitis are pain, swelling of the lid, and a decrease in vision. Thepatient classically shows inflammation of the eye, corneal edema and a hypopyon due to thepouring of exudates in the vitreous cavity, anterior chamber, and posterior chamber.Once the endophthalmitis sets in it is important to treat all the cases empirically with acombination of antibiotics and steroids from the beginning. The various drugs, routes and surgicalmanagement used to treat endophthalmitis are as follows:• The mainstay of treatment is intravitreal injections of antibiotics.•• First choice: Vancomycin 1 mg in 0.1 mL plus ceftazidime 2.25mg in 0.1ml.Second choice: Vancomycin 1 mg in 0.1 mL plus amikacin 0.4mg in 0.1ml.• If there is no improvement, a repeat intravitreal injection should be given after 48 hours• Topical antibiotics are started immediately and used frequently.•Vancomycin (50mg/ml) or cefazolin (50mg/ml)●Amikacin (20mg/ml) or tobramycin• Systemic antibiotics have a limited role in the treatment but are commonly used in practice.• Steroid therapy includes:• Intravitreal injection of dexamethasone (0.4mg in 0.1ml) which is started along with antibiotics.•Topical dexamethasone (0.1%)•• Oral steroids such as prednisolone are started after 24 hours of intensive antibiotic therapy.•Supportive therapy includes:• Cycloplegics such as atropine 1%292•Anti-glaucoma drugs such as oral acetazolamide or timolol in patients with raised intraocularpressure• Pars plana vitrectomy is done if the patient does not improve with the above therapy in 48-72hours or when the visual acuity is reduced to hand movements near the eyeOther options:Option A: Steroids are given in endophthalmitis to reduce the inflammation of the tissues. Thepreferred route of administration is either by intravitreal injections, topical concentrations or oralroute. Intravenous route (option A) of administration of steroids is not used in endophthalmitis.Option B: Systemic administration (intravenous) of antibiotics have a limited role in the treatmentbut are commonly used in practice as an add on.",

It is a type of after cataract.After cataract, or secondary cataract or posterior capsular opacification, is a late postoperativecomplication that follows extracapsular extraction of the lens. It is the most common latepostoperative complication. It may be caused by residual opaque lens matter or proliferation ofleft out anterior epithelial cells. Different types of after cataract include:•Elschnig's pearls: The subcapsular epithelial cells proliferate and develop into vacuolated soapbubble like clusters along the posterior capsule.•Soemmering's ring: A peripheral dense ring is formed behind the iris and is enclosed betweenlayers of the capsule.•⚫ Dense membranous after-cataract: It is formed in the pupillary area impairing the vision.• Thin membranous after-cataract: It is thickened posterior capsule.Types of after-cataractDense, membranous after-cataractMACOWSoemmering's ringElschnig's pearlsMARROW293Treatment of after cataract is by Nd-YAG laser capsulotomy of the posterior capsule, which workson the principle of photodisruption, or surgical posterior capsulotomy.Option B: Irvine-Gass syndrome is cystoid macular edema (CME) that develops in post-cataractsurgery patients. Though it is mostly clinically insignificant, some cases can present with blurringof vision, one to three months after surgery. In CME, on fundoscopy a honeycomb appearanceand on fundus fluorescein angiography(FFA) flower petal pattern can be seen. The below imagedepicts the flower petal pattern seen on FFA.Option C: Post operative endophthalmitis presents as ocular pain, diminished vision andhypopyon within months to years after the surgery. Fungal endophthalmitis can rarely occur withpuff ball exudates in the vitreous cavity.Option D: UGH syndrome is where uveitis, glaucoma and hyphema occurs simultaneously.

The lens swells andcauses secondary angle closure glaucoma.• Phacolytic glaucoma: Seen in hypermature cataract.

Also, thereare no symptoms nor signs of retinal detachment (RD), hence it is ruled out. Decreased vision notimproving with a pinhole in the presence of clear media is attributable to macular pathology. Also,there is a dull foveal reflex. The diagnosis in this patient is cystoid macular edema (CME).The incidence of clinical CME is about 1% to 2% following uncomplicated cataract surgeries. Theincidence of angiographic evidence of CME is 10 times greater at around 10% to 20%.Optical coherence tomography (option A) is useful in identifying cystoid macular edema andevaluating the vitreomacular interface.

      "explanation": "Rigid IOLs are made of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA).Depending on the type of material of manufacturing, 3 types of posterior chamber intraocular lens(PCIOLs) are available:•Rigid IOLs are made entirely from polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA).• Foldable IOLs are made of silicone, hydrogel, acrylic, and Collamer. These are implantedthrough a small incision.• Rollable IOLs are ultra-thin IOLs made of acyrlic or hydrogel. These are implanted through a1-mm incision after micro-incision cataract surgery technique.",

Anterior chamber IOLs lie entirely in front of the iris and are supported in the angleof the anterior chamber. These are associated with a higher incidence of bullous keratopathy.Thus, they are currently used only for correction of aphakia in cases where posterior chamberIOLs cannot be used (eg: rupture of posterior capsule).",
