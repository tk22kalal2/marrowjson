      "explanation": "Poor vision for distance (difficulty reading from the board) that is corrected with concave lens spectacles suggests that the child has myopia. The most common cause of myopia (shortsightedness) is increased anteroposterior length of the eyeball.

      "explanation": "School myopia or simple myopia is associated with a low to moderate degree of refractive error. Simple myopia is the most common type of myopia. It results from a normal biological variation in the development of the eye, i.e., increased anteroposterior diameter of the eyeball or increased curvature of the cornea. Other options: Options A and D: Pathological/Degenerative/Progressive myopia occurs due to degenerative changes in the retina, leading to a high degree of refractive error. Option B: Congenital myopia is associated with congenital anomalies of the eye, and a high degree of refractive error. Note: Other types of myopia include: 1. Nocturnal myopia: Accommodation is induced by low contrast in dim illumination. 2. Induced myopia: Temporary and reversible myopia due to external agents (e.g., pilocarpine-induced accommodation spasm) or variations in blood sugar levels. 3. Pseudomyopia: Inappropriately excessive accommodation due to overstimulation or ciliary spasm.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The above image shows the procedure of retinoscopy (skiascopy) being performed. As the red reflex is not moving with the movement of the retinoscope, the patient is interpreted as having myopia of 1D. Retinoscopy is an objective method of determining the error of refraction. It is based on the principle that when light is reflected from a mirror into the eye, the direction in which the light will travel across the pupil depends upon the refractive state of the eye. Interpretation of retinoscopy done at 1m is: No movement of red reflex: Myopia of 1D, Movement of red reflex with retinoscope: Emmetropia, hypermetropia, myopia less than 1D, Movement of red reflex against the retinoscope: Myopia more than 1D.",
