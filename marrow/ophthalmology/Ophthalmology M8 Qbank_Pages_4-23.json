      "explanation": "The optic groove appears by 3 weeks. By approximately day 22, 2 small grooves appear on either side of the developing forebrain in the neural folds, these are called optic grooves. As the neural tube closes, these grooves develop outpouchings called optic vesicles. These optic vesicles extend from the forebrain to the surface ectoderm. Transverse section through the developing forebrain - Day 22. The wall of forebrain, surface ectoderm, optic grooves, development of the eye, surface mesenchyme, optic ulcus, lens placode vesicle, neuroepithelium. The area of the neural plate where the future eye will be formed initially thickens and then gets depressed to form the optic sulcus. Optic vesicle: As the optic sulcus deepens, the wall of the prosencephalon overlying the sulcus bulges outwards to form the optic vesicle. Optic stalk: Neural retina, lens, ganglion, interneurons. The proximal part of the optic vesicle becomes constricted and elongated to form the optic stalk. As the lens vesicle is formed from the surface ectoderm, the optic stalk gets converted into the bilayered optic cup. Retinal pigmented epithelium: The lens is formed, and the optic cup is converted to neural retina.",

A coloboma is a congenital malformation in one of the structures in the eye, such as the iris, retina, choroid, or optic disc, due to the failure of embryonic fissure closure. Coloboma of the uveal tract may be typical (seen in the inferonasal quadrant) or atypical (occasionally found in other positions). Typical coloboma is of two types: Complete: Extends from pupil to optic nerve, causing a corresponding lens indentation. Incomplete: May involve iris alone, or iris and ciliary body (more common), or iris, ciliary body and a part of choroid. Other embryonic remnants in the eye: Mittendorf's dot - Remnant of the anterior end of the hyaloid artery. Bergmeister papilla - Remnant of the posterior end of the hyaloid artery.

      "explanation": "The image shows a coloboma of the optic disc, accompanied by a large chorioretinal coloboma located below the optic disc, which is caused by incomplete closure of the embryonic fissure. This developmental anomaly may involve the optic nerve, choroid, retina, and iris. Coloboma of the optic disc can present in two forms: a minor effect often associated with refractive errors like hypermetropia and astigmatism, and a fully developed coloboma that appears as a large inferonasal whitish excavation resembling the optic disc. Defective vision and superior visual field defects are typically associated with fully developed coloboma. Additionally, this condition may be associated with chorioretinal coloboma, a congenital anomaly where the developing optic cup fails to fuse completely, leading to abnormal choroidal and retinal development. Note: Faulty migration of neural crest cells results in anterior segment dysgenesis.",
